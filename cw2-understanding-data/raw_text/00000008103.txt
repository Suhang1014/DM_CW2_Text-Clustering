OCR Output OXU MONTES. oxus. in a direction from S\V. to NE., from the Aral to tlic"embouchure" of the Obi. The characteristic featureof tiiis depression is an immense number of chains ofsmall lakes,communicating with each other,arrangedin a circular form, or like a necklace. These lakesare probably the traces of Strabo's channel. Thefirst distinct statement of the Sea "f Aral, describedas a vast and broad lake, situated to the K. of theriver Ural or Jaik, occurs in Menander of Constan-nople, surnamed the '* Protector," who lived in thetime of the emperor Maurice. (Mcnand. Hist. Leqat.Barbarorum ad Romano*, pp. 300, 301, 619, 023,&2S, ed. Bonn, 1829). But it is only with theseries of Arab geographers, at the head of whommust be placed El-lstachry, that any positive infor­mation upon the topography of these regions com­mences. (Humboldt, Ante Ctntrule, vol. ii. pp.121—364.) [E.B.J.] O'XII MONTHS (to "n£«ia otf, l'tol. vi. 12.§§1, 4), a chain of mountains between the riversOx us and Jaxartcs, in a direction from S\V. to NE.,and which separated Scythia from Sogdiana Theyare identified with the metalliferous group of As-ferah and Aktayh — the Botom, Botm. or Botam("Mont Blanc') of Edrisi (ed. Jaubert, vol. ii.pp. 198—200). The Oxi Rupks of Strabo ('Hfouirerpa p. 517), which lie also calls the hill-tort ofArimazes (Q. Curt. vii. 11). has been identifiedby Droysen, as quoted by Thirl wall (Hint, ofGreece, vol. vi. p. 300), with the pass of Kohtghaor Derbetid, in the Kara-tagh, between Kith andHUsar; but as it is called the rock of the Ox us, itmust be looked for on that river, and is probablyKurffhan- Tippa on the --1 in it.

[E.B.J.] OXINES ('O^iVt/s), a small river on the coast ofBithynia, according to Arrian (Ptripl. p. 14) be­tween Heracleia and PhyIlium, and according toMarcianus (p. 70) 90 Madia to the north-east ofCape Posidium. (Comp. Anonym. Peripl. p. 4, where,as in Arrian, its name is Oxinas.) It is probablythe modern Tshartik. [L. S ] OXING1S. [AntiNX.] OXTHIiACAE ('O^pcwoi, Appian, B.

Besidesaffirming that the Oxus flowed through Hyrcania tothe Caspian or Hyrcanian sea, Strabo (ix. p. 509)adds, upon the authority of Aristobulus, that it wasone of the largest rivers of Asia, that it was navi­gable, and that by it much valuable merchandise wasconveyed to the Hyrcanian sea, and thence to Albania,and by the river Cyrus to the Euxine. Pliny (vi.19) also quotes M. Varro, who says that it wasascertained at the time when Pompeius was carryingon hostilities in the Ea-t against Mithridates, that ajourney of seven days from the frontier of Indiabrought the traveller to the Icarus, which flowedinto the Oxus; the voyage continued along that I river into the Caspian, and across it to Vt*Cyr^from whence a land journey of no mort tin: &days carried Indian merchandise to 1'hasi; in rataIt would appear (Strab. £ c.) that Patiwla, tiadmiral of Seleucus and Antux-hus. tad ainputhe Caspian, and that the results < f tus obsrniamwere in perfect accord with these Matetrienti Wasuch definite accounts mistake Amu&x imw*'^yet the country between the Caspian acd thtUthas been crossed in several directions, icd W >jlias the Oxus been unseen, but its course ias Uascertained to take a direction to the XW. bt<of to theSW.; and it flows not into llif Cssfwifi.tithe sea of Aral.

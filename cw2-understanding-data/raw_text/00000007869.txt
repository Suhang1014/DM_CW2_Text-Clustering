The port-town, which was named Celenderis (Pans. ii. 32.§ '.)). appears to have stood at tlie western extremityof the bay of Pogon, where some ancient remains arefound. Tlie high roc ky peninsula of Met liana,which belonged to the territory of Troezen and isunited to the mainland by a narrow isthmus, isdescribed in a separate article. [Methana.] Therewere formerly two islands ofl* the coast of Troezen,named Calaureia and Sphaeria (afterwards Iliera),which are now united by a narrow sandbank.(Leake. Mwea, vol. ii. p. 442, seq.; Boblaye, Re-cherclies, #c. p. 56; Curtius, Peloponnetos, vol. ii.p. 431, seq.) TROGI'LIUM (Tfwy't\iov), a promontory formedby the western termination of Mount Mjrcale, op-pottitc the island of Samos, Close to this pro­montory there was an island bearing the same name.(Strab. xiv. p. 636; Steph. R. s. v. TpuryiKos, ac­cording to whom it was also called Trogilia; Act.A post, xx. 15, where its name is Trogyllion.) Pliny(v. 31.s. 37) speaks of three islands being called Tro-giliae, their separate names being Pbilion, Argennon,and Sandalion. [L. S.] TROGI'LIUM, a town of Lu&itania, according toLuitprand (Adversaria, § 3D, ap. Wessel. ad I tin.p. 43$), the same place which Pliny (iv. 35) callsCustra Julia. It is incontestably the T ureal ion ofthe Geogr. Kav. (iv. 35) and the modern Truxillo.(Cf. Florez, Esp. Sugr. xiii. p. 114, and Ukert, ii.pt. i.p. 395.)

Under tlieterm Tro;rlodytae the ancienrs appear to have in­cluded various races of men. For we meet with themin Muuretania (Strab. xvii. p. 828) ; in tlie interior ofLibya east of the Garamantes, along the Arabianshore of the lied Sea, as well as on the opposite coastof Aethiopia and Aei;ypt, and on both in suchnumbers that the districts were each of them named"Regio Troglodytica;" and even on the northernside of the Caucasus (Strab, xi. p. 506). TheCaucasian Troglodytae were in a higher state ofcivilisation than their eastern namesakes, since theycultivated corn. Hut the race most commonly known as Troglo­dytae inhabited either shore of the lied Sea, andwere probably a mixture of Arabian and Aethiopianblood. '1 heir name, as its composition imports(rpjjy\-n. Sea?), was assigned to them because theyeither dug for themselves cabins in the lime andsandstone hills of that region, or availed tliem-selves of its natural caverns. Even in the lattercase, the tillages of the Troglodytae were partlyformed by art, since long tunnels, for the pas­sage or stabling of their herds, were cut betweenvillage and village, and the rocks were honey­combed by tiieir dwellings. Rruce saw at Gojamin Nubia a series of Mich caverns, inhabited byherdsmen, and witnessed the periodical passage ofthe cattle in Sennaar from the lowlands to thehills. The same cause led to similar migrations in | ancient times, vii^ the api-earaiwrf fstpfrlthe marches, immediately alter littamUxaperiodical rains.

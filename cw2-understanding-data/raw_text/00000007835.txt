The only remains of antiquity now visible at Kepiare some ancient sepulchres hewn in the rock, andsome portions of the ancient walls, much resemblingin their construction those of Sutrium and Falerii.These are considered by Dennis as belonging to theancient Etruscan city; but it is more probable thatthey date only from the Roman colony.

B.] NE'PHELIS (NeipeX/s), a small town on thecoast of Cilicia, situated, according to Ptolemy (v. 8.§ 1), between Antioch and Anemurium; but if, assome suppose, it be the same place as the ZttytAtovmentioned in the Stadiasmus Maris Magni (§§ 181,182), it ought to be looked for between Selinus andCelendcris. Xoar the place was a promontory of thesame name, where, according to Livy (xxxiii. 20),the fleet of Antiochus the Great was btatioued, when,after reducing the towns of Cilicia as far as Selinus,he was engaged in the siege of Coracesium, andwhere he received the ambassadors of the Rhodians.(Comp. Leake, Atia Minor, p. 119.) [L. S.] NE'PHERIS (Niptpis), a natural fortress situ­ated ou a rock, 180 stadia from the town of Car­thage. (Strab. xvii. p. 834.) . [E. B. J.] NEPTU'NIUS MONS. [Pelorus.] NEQUI'NUM.

[V.] NERE'TUM, or KERITUM (NVrrof, Ptol. iEth. Meretinus: Nardi), a city of the Sallentini, inthe ancient Calabria, mentioned both by Ptolemyand Pliny among the inland towns of that people.Its name is also found in the Tabula, which fixesits position 29 M. P. from Manduria on the rood toUxentum (Ugtnto), and 20 M. P. from the lattercity. These data enable us to identify it with cer­tainty with the modem town of Nurdi, a con­siderable place about 9 miles N. of CaUipoli. Itis clear from Pliny that it was a town of inuniciiialrank, and the same thing is confirmed by inscrip­tions; but there arc no ancient remains at Nardo.(Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Ptol. iii. 1. § 76; Tab. Peut.;Orel I. Inter. 3108. Other inscriptions, with thename of husic, KERIT. published by Muratori,vol. ii. pp. 1113, 1120, and by Ilomanelli, vol. ii.pp. 49, 50, are probably spurious. See Orelli,138.) [E. H. B.] NE'RICUS. [Leccas.] NERIGOS. PUny (iv. 16. s. 30), in speaking ofthe islands in the north of Britain, says that, accordingto some, Nerigos was the largest, and that from itpeople used to sail to Thule. As besides this pas­sage we have no other information, it is impossible,with absolute certainty, to say what island is meant;but as Norway is in Danish still called Norge, andin Swedish Norrige, it is now generally assumedthat Nerigos is tbe modem Norway; the south­western headland of which, projecting into the sea,might easily lead the ancients to the belief that it wasan island. In the same passage Pliny mentions theisland of Bergi, which may possibly be only the E E S

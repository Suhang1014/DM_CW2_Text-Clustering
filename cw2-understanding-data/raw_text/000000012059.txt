[Book IV. purely aristocratic blood was in general of no use, andthat Sulla clearly discerned its uselessness, is shown by thefact that, with the exception of Quintus Metellus who wasrelated to him by marriage, he selected all his instrumentsout of what was previously the middle party and the desertersfrom the democratic camp—such as Lucius Flaccus, LuciusPhilippus, Quintus Ofella, Gnaeus Pompeius. Sulla was asmuch in earnest about the restoration of the old constitu­tion as the most vehement aristocratic emigrant; he under­stood however, not perhaps to the full extent—for how inthat case could he have put hand to the work at all ?—butbetter at any rate than his party, the enormous difficultieswhich attended this work of restoration.

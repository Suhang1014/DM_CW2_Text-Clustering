(Leake, Northern Grace,vol. iii. p. 425.) [E. B.J.] PAX JULIA (n&l 'louMo, Ptol. ii. 5. § 5; calledin the Geogr. Rav., iv. 43, Pacca Julia), a town ofthe Turdetani, in the S. of Lusitania, ami on theroad from Esuris to Ebora (/fin. Ant. pp. 426. 427).But on the subject of this route see Lusitania,Vol. II. p. 220. It was a Iioman colony, and theseat of a Conventus juridicus (Plin. iv. 35); probahlythe same town as that called Pax Augusta by Strnbo(iii. p. 151),— as many towns bore double names inthis manner, — notwithstanding that it is placed byhim among the Cellici. (Ukert, v h ii. pt. 1. p. 388,and the authorities there cited.) It lay on a hillK. of Julia Myrtilis, and ia commonly identified withBeja. [T. H.

PEDAEUM or PEDAEUS (nt)Jaioi<). a placementioned by Homer (//. xiii. 172), which is saidby Eustathius to have been a town in Troas; but itis otherwise entirely uuknown. [L. S.] PEDA'LIE, a place on the coast of Cilicia, be­tween Pinara and Ale, is mentioned only by Pliny(v. 22), and its exact site is unknown. [L. S.] PEDA'LIUM (riTjSdAio*'), a promontory in thesouth-east of Caria, funning the southernmost pointof the western coast of the Sinus Glaucus. (Pomp.Mela, i. 16; Plin. v. 29; Sludiatm. Mar. Magn.§§ 228, 233, 234.) Strabo (xiv. p. 651) gives tothe same promontory the name of Arteinisium, froma temple of Artemis, which stood upon it; itsmodern name is Bvkontadhi. (Leake, Asia Minor,p. 223, foil.) [L. S.] PE'DASA (n<«oiro: Eth. Tl-ritaotvi). also calledPEDASL'II (Plin. v. 29), an ancient city of Caria,in which the Persians suffered a defeat during therevolt of the Ionians. (Herod, v. 121, vi. 20.) Itwas once the chief seat of the Leleges. Alexanderthe Great deprived the place of its independence bygiving it over to the Halicarnassians, together withfive other neighbouring towns. (Plin. /. c.) In thetime of Strabo (xiii. p. 611) the town had censed toexist, and the name of the district, Pedasis (flTjooit), was the only remaining memorial of the place.(Comp. Polyb. xviii. 27; Stcph. B. «. «.) As He­rodotus assigns to Pedasa a portion of tlie territoryof Miletus, it is clear that the town must have beensituated between Miletus, Halicarnassus, ami Strato-niceia; but its exact site is still only matter of con­jecture, some placing it at the modern Melasso, andothers at Arabi //war, neither of which supposi­tions is free from inconsistencies. [L. S.] PE'IiASUS (n^oWoj), a small town of Mysia,on the river Satnioeis, which is mentioned by Homer(/I. vi. 35, xx. 92, xxi. 87), but was deserted in thetime of Strabo (xiii. p. 605), who (p. 584) mentionsit among the towns of the Leleges, which were de­stroyed by Achilles. (Comp. Steph. B. ». v. Ylifcana.Pliny (v. 32) imagines that Pedasus was the sameplace as that which subsequently bore the name ofAdramyttium; but as Homer distinctly places it of

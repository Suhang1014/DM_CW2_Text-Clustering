(Strut), vi. p. 284;I'lin. ii'i. 12. s. 17; Ptol. iii. 1. § 16.) The LiberColoniaruio also speaks of it as a colony adjoiningthe sea-coast, which doubtless refers to the new townof the name. Tin's does not, however, seem to haveever risen into a place of much importance, andthe name subsequently disappears altogether. Extensive ruins of Salapia are slill visible on thesouthern shore of the J.-nf/n ifi S/tlpi, in a tract ofcountry now almost wholly desolate. They evidentlybelong to a city of considerable size and importance,and must therefore be those of the ancient Apuliancity. This is further confirmed by the circumstancethat the coins of Salapia, which of course belong tothe period of its independence, are frequently foundon the spot. (Swinburne's Traveli, vol. i. p. 81.)The site of the Roman town founded by M. Uostiliusis said to be indicated by some remains on the sea­shore, near the Torre di Salpi. (Romanelli, vol. ii.p. 201.) The lagune still called the Logo diSalpi is about12 miles in length by about 2 in breadth. At itseastern extremity, where it communicates with thesea by an artificial cut, are extensive salt-works,which are considered to he the representatives ofthese noticed in the Itineraries under the name ofSalinae. It is by no means certain (though notimprobable) that these ancient salt-works occupiedthe same site as the modern ones ; and the distances [given in the Itineraries along this line of coast, beingin anv case corrupt and confused, afford no clue totheir identification, (/tin. Ant. p. 314; Tub. I'tut.')It is probable that the name of Salapia itself is eon-!nected with sal, the htgune having always been welladapted for the collection of salt. The coins of Salapia,as well as those of Arpi and jCamtsium, have Greek legends, and indicate the |strong influence of Greek ait and civilisation, thoughapparently al a late period, none of them being of anarchaic stvle. The magistrates' names which occuron them (AAZOS, I1TAA02. &c.) are, on the con-trurv, clearly of native origin. (Mommsen, U. /. D.pp. 82, 83.) [E. H. Ii.] COtX OF SAI«\PIA. SALA'IIIA. 1.

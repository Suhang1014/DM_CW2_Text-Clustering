From the Iberian Caucasus,the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia, .thatriver descends with such oblique vehemence, that ina short space it is traversed by one hundred andtwenty bridges. Nor does the stream become placidand navigable, till it reaches the town of Sarapana,five days' journey from the Cyrus, which flows fromthe same hills, but in a contrary direction, to theCaspian lake. The proximity of these rivers hassuggested the practice, or at least the idea, of waft足ing the precious merchandise of India down theOxus, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with thecurrent of the Phasis into the Euxine and Mediter足ranean seas. As it successively collects the streamsof the plain of Colchos, the Phasis moves with di足minished speed, though accumulated weight. Atthe mouth it is sixty fathoms deep and half a leaguebroad, but a small woody island is interposed in themidst of the channel: the water, so soon as it hasdeposited an earthy or metallic sediment, floats onthe surface of the waves, and is no longer susceptibleof corruption. In a course of one hundred miles,forty of which are navigable for large vessels, thePhasis divides the celebrated region of Colchos, orMingrelia, which, on three sides, is fortified by theIberian and Armenian mountains, and whose mari足time coast extends about two hundred miles, fromthe neighbourhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias, andthe confines of Circassia. Both the soil and climateare relaxed by excessive moisture: twenty-eightrivers, besides the Phasis and his dependent streams,convey their waters to the sea; and the hollownessof the ground appears to indicate the subterraneouschannels between the Euxine and the Caspian.

D'Anville (A'oiic*, <fc) ingeniously supposes thatOnobrisates ought to be Onobusntes, which is theleast possible correction; and he thinks that he dis­covers the old name in the modern Ntbousan, thename of a canton on the left side of the Neste to­wards the lower part of its course.

It is now entirely surrounded with water, andis called Elafonisi; but it is in reality a peninsula,for the isthmus, by which it is connected with themainland, is only barely covered with water. Itcontains a harbour, which Strabo mentions; andPausanias saw a temple of Athena in ruins, and thesepulchre of Cinadus, the steersman of Menelaus.(Paus. iii. 22. § 10, iii. 23. § 1; Strab. viii. pp. 363,364; Curtius, Peloponnesus, vol. ii. p. 295.) ONU'PHIS ("Oouoiij, Herod, ii. 166; Steph. B.*. r.; Ptol. iv. 5. § 51 ; Plin. V. 9. s. 9: Eth. 'Ovou-9>1ti)s), was the chief town of the Nomos Onu-phites, in the Aegyptian Delta. The exact positionof this place is disputed by geographers. D'Anvillebelieves it to have been on the site of the modemBanoub, on the western hank of the Sebennytic armof the Nile. Maunert (vol. x. pt. i, p. 573) placesit south of the modern Mansour. lielley {Mem. deVAcad. des Inscript. torn, xxviii. p. 543) identifiesit with the present village of Nouph, in the centreof the Delta, a little to the E. of Buto, about lat.31° X. Champollion, however, regards the site ofthis nome as altogether uncertain (TEgypte sons ItsPharaohs, vol. ii. p. 227). The Onuphite nome wasone of those assigned to the Calasirian division ofthe native Aegyptian army. Coins of Onuphis ofthe age of Hadrian — obverse a laureated huad ofthat emperor, reverse a female figure, probablyIsis, with extended right hand — are described inKasche {Lex. It. Num. III. pars posterior, s.v.~).This town is mentioned by ecclesiastical writers,e.g. by Athanasius. (Athanas. Opera, torn. i. pt. ii.p. 776, ed. Paris, 1698; Le Quien, Orient Chris­tian, torn. ii. p. 526, Paris, 1740; com p. Pococke,Travel* in the East, fol. vol. i. p. 423.) [W.B.D.J OONAE.

The topazes pro­duced in this island were greatly prized both in theArabian and Aegyptian markets; and it seems fromPliny (v. 29. ». 34) to have been by some deno­minated Topaz-isle (Topazos).

They engaged first in a plain; the battle was bloody,and the slaughter great on both sides, which being moresensibly felt by the Romans, as they were less numerous,a defeat would have followed, had not the consul, by awell-timed fiction, inspired them with fresh courage,crying out, that the enemy was routed in the other wing.Wherefore, the army making a fresh attack, and believ­ing themselves victorious, became really so. The con­sul, afraid to push his success too far, lest they shouldrally, sounded a retreat. For some days, both armiescontinued so quiet, that one would have imagined theyhad privately consented to a truce. During this respite, the army of the Volsci was con­siderably reinforced by numbers of their own country,and that of the .3Lqui, imagining, that the Romans, themoment they were advised of this Secession, wouldmarch oflfin the night: impressed with this opinion, theycame before the third watch to storm the camp. Quinc-tius having dissipated the terror occasioned by this sud-den alarm, gave orders, that all should remain quiet intheir tents, and led out of the camp a body of the Her-iiici fer an advanced guard; and to keep the enemy in aconstant alarm till day-light, he set the trumpeters andblowers on the horn, on horseback, with orders to play,from time to time, before the rampart, For the rest ofthe night, every thing was so quiet in the camp, thatthe Romans were sufficiently refreshed. The appearance of a body of infantry in arms, whomthe Volsci took for Romans, superior in number to them­selves; the noise and neighing of the horses, which, un­accustomed to this kind of riders, and frightened with thesound of their instruments, were very attractable, keptthe Volsci as much upon their guard, as if they hadIjeen every moment to be attacked by the enemy.

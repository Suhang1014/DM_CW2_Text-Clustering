But these twonumbers exceed the distance between Besanconand Mandeure. The termination durum seems toshow that Velatodurum was on a stream; andD'Anville conjectures that it is near Clereval on theDoubs, where there is a place named Pont-pierre.lint this is merely a guess.

From the mode in which these are buried,it seems certain that the town was overwhelmed bya vast landslip from the neighbouring mountain.Systematic excavations on the spot, which have beencarried on since 1760, have brought to light severalbuildings of the ancient city, including the amphi­theatre, a basilica, the forum, and several temples;and the groat number of bronze ornaments and im­plements of a domestic kind, as well as statues,busts, oVc., which have been discovered on the spot,have given celebrity to Veleia as the Pompeii ofNorthern Italy. Unfortunately the great weight ofthe superincumbent mass has crushed in the build­ings, so that all the upper part of them is destroyed,and the larger statues have suffered severely frum thesame cause. The inscriptions found there attest thatVeleia was a flourishing municipal town in the firstcenturies of the Roman Empire.

OCR Output THE DECLINE AND FALL, &c. the feeble efforts of reason, was at length assaulted by a crowd ofdaring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century,assumed the popular character of reformers. The church of Romedefended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud ja system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscrip足tions, wars, massacres, and the institution of the holy office. Andas the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as ofreligious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interestwith that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword theterrors of spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone, morethan one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles the Fifth aresaid to have suffered by the hand of the executioner; and this ex足traordinary number is attested by Grotius ,?+, a man of genius andlearning, who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contend足ing sects, and who composed the annals of his own age and country,at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the meansof intelligence, and increased the danger of detection. If we areobliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotiue, it must beallowed, that the number of Protestants, who were executed in asingle province, and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitivemartyrs in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman empire.But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over theweight of evidence: if Grotius should be convicted of exaggeratingthe merit and sufferings of the Reformers,8J; we shall be naturallyled to inquire, what confidence can be placed in the doubtful andimperfect monuments of ancient credulity; what degree of credit canbe assigned to a courtly bishop, and a passionate declaimer, who,under the protection of Constantine, enjoyed the exclusive privilegeof recording the persecutions, which Christianity had experiencedfrom the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gra足cious sovereign.

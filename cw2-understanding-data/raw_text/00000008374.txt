AnL p. 405), culled Sex (2U£) by Ptolemy(ii. 4. § 7). Hexi by Mela (ii. 6), and by I'liny (iiL3) Sexti Finnum Julium. It is the 'Z^iTavCiv■w6\is of Strabo (iii. p. 156). On the name seeCasaubon (ad Strab. i. p. 50), and Tzschuek (adMelam, vol. ii. pt 2. p. 447). It was renowned forits salt-fish.

D.] SA'XONES (2,d£ovfs; Saxons'), a German tribe,which, though it acted a very promineut part aboutthe beginning and during the early part of themiddle ages, yet is not even mentioned in ancienthistory previous to a. l>. 287. In that year, we aretold by Eutropius (vii. 13; com p. Oros. vii. 25), theStxona and Franks infested the coasts of Arraoricaand Belgica, the protection of which was intrustedto Caruusius. The fact that Pliny and Tacitus donot mention them in the country in which we after­wards find them, does not prove that they did notexist there in the time of those writers. For theinhabitants of the Cimbriau Chersouesus, wheresubsequently we find the Saxons, are mentioned bythose writers only under the general appellation ofthe Cimbri, without noticing any special tribes underseparate names. Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 11; comp. Steph.B. a. v.) is the first authority describing the ha­bitations of the Saxons, and according to htm theyoccupied the narrow neck of the Cimbrian Cherso-nesus, between the river Albis (Elbe) and Chalusus(Trave), that is, the country now called llolstein.Their neighbours on the south of the Albis were theChauci, in the east the Suardones, and in the norththe Singulones, Ajngli, and other smaller tribes ofthe peninsula. But besides this portion of thecontinent, the Saxons also occupied three islands,called " Saxon islands," off the coast of Hulstrin(Sc^oWv fj}<to<, Ptol. ii. II. § 31), one of whichwas no doubt the modern Helgoland; the two othersmust either be supjwsed to have been swallowedup by the sea, or be identified with the islands ofDyckumd and Vielschovtl, which are nearer thecoast than Helgoland. The name Saxones is commonly derived fromSaks or Sachs, a battle knife, but others connect itwith seax (earth) or seat, according to which Saxonswould describe the people as living in fixed seats orhabitations, as opposed to the free or wanderingFranks. The former, however, is the more probableorigin of the name; for the living in fixed habitationswas certainly not a characteristic mark of the ancientSaxons. They appear to have gradually spread along thenorth-western coast of Germany, and to have gainedpossession of a large extent of country, which theRavenna Geographer (iv. 17, 18, 23) calls by thename of Saxon ia, but which WU certainly not in-habited by Saxons exclusively In a. i>. 371 theSaXOUa, in ouo of their usual ravaging excursions onthe coasts of Gaul, were surrounded and cut topieces by the Roman army under Valentinian (Oros.vii. 32; Arum. Marc, xxviii. 2, 5; comp. xwi. 4,xxvii. 8; ZoBUD. iii. 1, G); and about the middle ofthe fifth century a band of Saxons led by Hen gistand llorsa crossed over Into Britain, which had beencompletely given up by the Romans, and now fellinto the hands of the roving Saxons, who in con- nection with other German tribes penmontiy ess*blished themselves in Britain, and tint ami**!the great features of their national character.

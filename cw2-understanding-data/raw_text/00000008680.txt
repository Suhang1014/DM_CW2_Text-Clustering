D.] TI'NIA (Tnias: Timia), a small river of llm.ma, Huang into the Tiber, a few miles belowVnuia. The name is given by tho ancient geogra-:brr« lo the affluent of the Tiber (one of the firstnsutarim which that river receives), hot at theimrnt day the stream called the Timia loses itsLime after its junction with the Topino, a moreuuddrrmble stream. Four small rivers indeed bringl«wn their united waters to the Tiber at this point:. the MnrtKffiiii, which rises between Todt and>l**Utn, and brings with it the waters of the Cli-mm, tho ancient Cmtumnus; 2, the Timia,rhivti jikins the Glitumnus near Mevania (Hc->»pi<i); 3, the Tupino, which descends from thoL|rw)ines near Sooera, and turns abruptly to thetlV., after receiving the waters of the Timia; and. ihe CAwucio, which joins the Topino from theI. only 3 miles from the point where it falls intoTiber. Though thus augmented from variousouters the Tinia was always an inconsiderableT>m. I'liny s|ieaks of it as navigable withificolly even for boats, and Si I i us Italicus calls itTiniae inglorios humor." (SiL Ital. viii. 452;■fin. iii. 5. s. 9; Strab. v. p. 227.) [E. H.

S.] TIN'U'KTIt'M, in Gallia, is placed in the Itins.nr the Satme, between Cabillonum (Chalum) andl-ilisra (Macon). The Antonine Itin. marks M.P.ii.. Irucas xiiii. between Cabillonum and Tinur-tiin, which is Tuumus. Tho Table gives onlyi, which appears to be nearer the truth. The'o Itins. do not agree in the distance betweenuranium and Matisco. Spartianus ( Yka Septim.'"ri, c. 11) says that Scverus defeated Clodiusit-urns at Tinurtium, or Trinurtium, for tire reading|»rhaps doubtful. (Is. Casaubon, in Aelium Spar-»'urn notae). Dion (Ixxv. c 6), Herodian (iii. 7),•1 Kutropim (viii. 18) speak of Clodius Albinusft defeated by Severus at or near I-ugdunum'v»). The name Tinurtiuin appears to be some-nes miswritten Tiburtium. [G. L.] TldRA MATIENA. [Abowoixm.]Tll'AKENUS, an island off the coast of Her­nia in Argolis, mentioned only by I'liny (iv. 12.19). It is frequently identified with SpeUia ; but-tke remarks that Tiparenus has no appearance of11 reek name, and conjectures that it is an errort Tricarenns, the same as the Tricrana of Fau­nas (ii. 34. § 8) and the modern Trikkiri.Tike, Mono, vol. ii. p. 465; Boss, WanderungenVritckenland, vol. ii. p. 21).TIPASA (Tliao-o, PtoL iv. 2. § 5). 1.

PhiL ad Allt. ap.Dem. p. 159, It.), a town of the Thracian Cherso-ncsus, on the coast of the Propontis. It was in­cluded in the dominioan of Philip, wbo in tbe letterabove referred to complains that the Atheniangeneral Diopeithes had taken it and sold its inhabit­ants for slaves (n. c. 340) [DiorEtTiiKS, liicUBum/.] According to Choiseul, its site is still occu­pied by a village bearing the same name. [J. R] TIRIZIS (Ti'pifu, Strab. vii. p 319), a very pro­jecting headland of Mocsia in the Pontus Euxiuus.The name varies, being written Tipifa in Anon.(Perip. P.

Tipw-flior: the name isperhaps connected with rvfyn, Lepsius, Tyrrh. Pe-lasger, p. 13), one of the most ancient cities ofGreece, lay a short distance SE. of Argrv, on thoright of the road leading to Kpidaurus (Paus. ii. 25.§ 8), and at tho distance of 12 stadia from Nau-plia. (Strab. viii. p. 373.) Its massive walls,which have been regarded with wonder in all ages,are said to have been the work of the Cyclopes,and belong to the same age as those of Mycenae.(Paus. ii. 16. § 5, ii. 25. § 8, vii. 25. § 6, ix. 36. §5; Strab. I. c; Plin. vii. 56. s. 57.) Hence Homercalls the city Tlpvvs Tfi^ioWoa. (//. ii. 559.)Pindar speaks of the KvirAwiua wpABvpa of Tiryns(f'ragm. 642, ed. Bbckh), and Pausanias says thattho walls arc not less worthy of admiration than thepyramids of Egypt (ix. 36. § 5.) In another pas­sage he describes the walls as consisting of widemasses of stone (0070! AWoi), of such a size, that ayoke of oxen could not stir the least of them, theinterstices being filled in with smaller stones tomake the whole more compact and solid. (Paus. it25. § 8.) The foundation of Tiryns ascends to thoearliest mythical legends of the Argeia. It wassaid to have derived its name from Tiryns, the sonof Argus (Pans. ii. 25. § 8), and to have beenfounded by Proetus. (Strab. viii. p. 372; Paus. ii.16. § 2.) According to the common tradition, Me-gapenthes, the son of Proetus, ceded Tiryns toPerseus, who transmitted it to his descendant Elec-tryon. Alcmcna, the daughter of Elcctryon, mar­ried Amphitryon, who would have succeeded to thocrown, bad he not been expelled by Slhenelus, kingof Argos. Their son Hercules afterwards refrainedpossession of Tiryns, where he lived for many years,and hence is frequently called Tirynthius by thepoets. (lies. Scut. 81; Pind. OL X. 37, hthm. vi.39; Virg. Aen. vii. 662; Ov. Met vii. 410.) Al­though Tiryns was thus closely connected with thoHeraclidae, yet the city remained in the hands ofthe old Achaean population after the return of theHeraclidae and the conquest of Peloponnesus by the

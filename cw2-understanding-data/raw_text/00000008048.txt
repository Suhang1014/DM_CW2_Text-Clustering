Ptolemy (iii. 15. § 26)lias preserved the names of two places, Eleusin orEleusis, and Oca; and a third, called Melaenae,occurs in an inscription. (Bockh, Inscr. no. 2448.)Like Melos, Thera sided with the Lacedaemoniansat the commencement of the Peloponnesian War(Thuc. ii. 9), but of its subsequent history we haveno information. Thera and the surrounding islands are remarkableas having been the scene of active volcanic operationsin ancient as well as in modern times. In con­sequence of the survey made by command of theEnglish Admiralty, we now possess precise infor-mation respecting these islands, the result of which,with additional particulars, is given by LieutenantLeycester in a paper published in the Journal of theRoyal Geographical Society, from which the followingaccount is chiefly taken. Thera, now called Santorin,the largest of the group, has been likened in form toa horse-shoe; but a crescent with its two points elon­gated towards the west would be a more exact de­scription. The distance round the inner curve is 12miles, and round the outer 18, making the coast-lineof the whole island 30 miles: its breadth is in nopart more than 3 miles. Opposite to Thera west­ward is Therasia, which still bears the same name.(Strab. i. p. 57, v. p. 484; Steph. 11. s. v. &npatria;Ptol. iii. 15. § 28; I'lin. ii. 87. s. 89, iv. 12. s. 70.)Its circuit is 7^ miles, its length front N. to S.about 2}j miles, and its breadth a mile. AboutIf mile S. of Therasia, lies Aspronisi, or WhiteIsland, only a mile in circuit, and so called frombeing capped with a deep layer of pozzolana: thename of this island is not mentioned by the ancientwriters. These three islands, Thera, Therasia, andAspronisi, enclose an expanse of water nearly 18miles in circumference, which is in reality ihecrater of a great volcano. The islands were origin­ally united, and were subsequently separated bythe eruption of the crater. In the centre of thisbasin three volcanic mountains rise, known by thename of Kammeni or the Burnt, (Kafx^iyrj, i. e.Kavuevn instead of ice/fallien?), and distinguishedas the Palaea or Old, the Nea or New, and theMikra or Little. It was formerly asserted thatthe basin was unfathomable, but its depth and shapehave been clearly ascertained by the soundings ofthe English Survey. Supposing the basin could bedrained, a gigantic bowl-shaped cavity would appear,with walls 2449 feet high in some places, and no­where less than 1200 feet high, while the Kant-mvnis would be seen to form in the centre a hugemountain b\ miles in circumference with threesummits, the Palaea Kammeni, (he Nea Kammeni,and the Mikra Kammeni, rising severally from thebottom of the abyss to the height of 1606, 1629,and 1550 feet. The rim of the great crater thusexposed would appear in all parts unbroken, exceptat the northern point between Thera and Therasia,where there is a chasm or door into the crater abouta mile in width, and 1170 feet in depth midwaybetween the two islands. (See Map, B.) If wenow suppose the waters of the Aegaean let in,the edges of the crater, forming the inner curve ofThera and Therasia, rise above the sea from theheight of 500 to 1200 feet, and present frightfulprecipices, of the colour of iron dross, except wheretheir summits are capped with a deep layer of poz-ilatm. The Palaea Kammeni is 328 feet above thewater; the Nea Kammeni 351 feet; and the MikraKammeni 222 feet.

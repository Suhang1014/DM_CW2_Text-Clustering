And thus have I, with all possible brevity, de­scribed the country of Judea, and those that lie roundabout it. CHAPTER IV. JOSEPHUS MAKES AN ATTEMPT UPON SEPPHORIS, BUT IS RE­PELLED. TITUS COMES WITH A GREAT ARMVT TO PTOLEMAIS. § 1. Now the auxiliaries which were sent to assist the peopleof Sepphoris, being a thousand horsemen and six thousandfootmen, under Placidus the tribune, pitched their camp intwo bodies in the great plain. The foot were put into the cityto be a guard to it, but the horse lodged abroad in the camp.These last, by marching continually one way or other, andoverrunning the parts of the adjoining country, were verytroublesome to Josephus and his men; they also plunderedall the places that wero out of the city's liberty, and inter­cepted such as durst go abroad. On this account it was thatJosephus marched against the city, as hoping to take what hehad lately encompassed with so strong a wall, before they re­volted from the rest of the Galileans, that the Romans wouldhave had much ado to take it: by which means he proved tooweak, and failed of his hopes, both as to the forcing the place,and as to his prevailing with the people of Sepphoris to de­liver it up to him. By this means he provoked the Romansto treat the country according to the law* of war ; nor did theRomans, out of the anger they bore at this attempt, leave offeither by night or by day burning the places in the plain, andstealing away the cattle that were in the country, and killingwhatsoever appeared capable of fighting, perpetually, andleading the weaker people as slaves into captivity: so thatGalilee was all over filled with fire and blood; nor was itexempted from any kind of misery or calamity; for the onlyrefuge they had was this, that when they were pursued, theycould retire to the cities which had walls built them byJosephus.

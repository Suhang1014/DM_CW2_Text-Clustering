Book IX, .brought their o.wn gods into Samaria; and by worshippmg them,.as was the custom of their own countries, they provoked Almigh­ty God to be angry and displeased at them, for a plague .seized.upon them, by which they were destroyed; and when they foundno cure for their miseries, they learned by the oracle that they.ought to worship Almighty God, as the method for their deliv­erance. So they sent ambassadors to l|he king of Assyria, ianddesired him to send them some of those priests of-the Israelites'whom he had taken .captive. And when he thereupon sent them,and the people were by them taught the laws, and the holy wor-ship of God, they worshipped him in a respectful manner, andthe plague ceased immediately; and indeed they continue tomake use of the very same customs to this very time, and are-called in the Hebrew tongue Cutheans, but in the Greek tongueSamaritans. And when they see the Jews in prosperity, theypretend that they are changed, and allied to them, and call themkinsmen, as though they were derived from Joseph, and had bythat means an original alliance with them: but when they seethem falling into a low condition, they say they are no way re-Jated to them, and that the Jews have no right tp expect anykindness or marks of kindred from them, but they declare thatthey are sojourners, that come from other .countries. But ofthese we shall have a more seasonable opportunity to discoursehereafter.

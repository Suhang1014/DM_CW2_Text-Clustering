Seleueis, otherwise called Tetrapolis, thebest of the before-named districts, was .subdividedaccording to the number of its four principal cities,Seleueis of Pieria, Antioch, Apnmeia, and Laodiceia.The Orontes flowed from Coelesyru through thisdistrict, having to the east the cities of Bambyce,Beroea, and Herucleia, and tlie river Euphrates.Herucleia was 20 stadia distant from the templeof Athena at Cyrrhestis. This gave its name toCyrrhestice which extended as fur as Antiochis tothe south, touched the Amanus on the north, andwas roil term i nous with Commagene on the east, hiCyrrhestice were situated Gindarus, its capital, andnear it Heracleuin. Contiguous to Gindarus layPagrae of Antiochis, on the Amanus, above the plainof Antioch, which was watered by the Arceuthus, the0routes, the Labotas, and the Oenoparas, in whichwas also the camp of Meleager; above these lay thetable mount, Trapezae. On the const were Scleuceiaand Mount Pieria, attached to the Amanus, andRhosu* ('Pwrrtif), between Issusand Seleuceia. Southof Antiochis was Apnmeia, lying inland; sooth ofSeleueis Mount Casius and Anticasius: but theformer was divided from Seleuceia by the embouchureof the Orontes and the rock-hewn temple of Nvm-phaeum; then Posidium a small town, Heracleia,Laodiceia, 6lc The mountains east of Laodiceia,sloping gradually on their west side, had a steeperInclination on the east towards Apameia (named bythe Macedonians [Vila) and the Chersonese, as therich valley of the Oruiites about that city was called.Conterminous with the district of Apamene, on theeast, was the country of the phy larch of the Arabs,named Parapotainia, and Chalcidice, extending fromtb.e Massy as; while the Scenite Arabs also occupiedthe south, being less wild and less distinctively Aral'sin proportion as they were brought nearer by positionto the influence* of Syrian civilisation. {Ibid. pp.749—753.) Then follows the description of theCoast, which belongs to Phoenicia (sup. p. 600), andIns extraordinary mis-statement abont Libanus andAntihbanus (p. 75;")) alluded to under those articles.According to this view, the western termination ofI.ibnnus was on the coast, a little to the south ofTripoli, at a place called &*uvtrp6<Twwovl while Anti-lib.uius commenced at Sidon. The two ranges thenran parallel towards the east, until they terminatedin the mountains of the Arabians, above Damascus,and in the two Trachonea [TkaOHOMITIs]. Be­tween these two ranges lay the great plain of Coele-Hyria, divided into several districts, the width at thesea 200 stadia, the length inland about double thewidth; fertilised by rivers, the largest of which wasthe Jordan, and having a lake called Gennesaritis[TiBKitlAS Makk]. The Chrysorrhoas, which rosenear Damascus, was almost wholly absorbed in irri­gation. The Lycus and Jurdail were navigated bythe A radians. The westernmost of the plains,along i he sea-border, was called Macra (MdxpaT^Sior), next to which was Massyas, with a hillydistrict in which Chalets was situated as u kind ofacropolis of the district, which commenced at Lao­diceia ad Libanum. This billy district was heldby the liuraeans and Arabs [Itukaka]. AboveMassyas was the Royal Plain (AvAwv Boiti Autos)and the country of Damasc us, followed by the Tra-chones, &e. (pp. 755, 756).

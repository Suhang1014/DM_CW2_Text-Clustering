The Athenians therefore, when all was fixed and deter­mined on both sides, crossed over by night to Minoa theisland of the Megareans with six hundred heavy-armed,commanded by Hippocrates, and sat themselves down in ahollow whence the bricks for the walls had been taken,and which lay near enough for their purpose : whilst anotherbody, under Demosthenes the other commander, consistingof light-armed Plateeans, and the Athenian patroles, con­cealed themselves near the temple of Mars, which lies stillnearer. Not a soul within the city knew any thing of thesemotions, excepting those whose vigilance it concerned thisnight to observe them. When the morning was ready tobreak, the plotters of Megara proceeded thus— Through a series of time they had established a customto have the gates of the long walls opened to them in thenight, by carrying out a wherry upon a carriage, which theypersuaded the officers posted there, they conveyed nightlydown the ditch into the sea, and so went upon a cruize.And before it was light, bringing it back again to the wallsupon the carriage, they conveyed it through the gates, thatit might escape the notice of the Athenian watch on Minoa,who by this means might be eluded, as they never woulddescry any boat in the harbour. The carriage was now atthe gates, which were opened as usual for the reception ofthe wherry. This the Athenians observing (for this was thesignal agreed on), came running from their place of ambushto take possession of the gates before they could be shutagain. The very moment the carriage was between, andobstructed the closing thenl together, both they and theMegarean coadjutors, put the watch which was posted atthe gates to the sword. The Plataans and patroling partiesunder Demosthenes rushed in first to that spot where thetrophy now stands, and having thus gained an entrance (forthe Peloponnesians who were nearest had taken the alarm)the Plataeans made good their ground against those who at­tacked them, and secured the gates till the heavy-armed.Athenians, who were coming up with all speed, had entered.

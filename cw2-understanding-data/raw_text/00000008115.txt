[V.] SAELPNI. [Astuhks. Vol. I p. 249.] SAEITNUM orSKl,I'M'M(the name is variouslywritten both in MSS. and even ir.wriptious, butSaepinum is probably the most correct form: 2af-TTivui; Ptol,: Eth. Saepinas: Aitilia near Sepino),a city of Samnium, in the country of the Pentri, onthe E. slope of the great group of the Monte Ma-tese, and near the sources of the Tomaro (Tamarus).It seems to have been in early times one of the chieftowns of the Samnites,or rather one of the few whichthey possessed worthy of the name. From its po­sition in the heart of their country it was not till theThird Samnite War that it was attacked by theRoman arms; but in B.C. 293 it was besieged bythe consul L. Papirius Cursor, and though vigorouslydefended by a garrison amounting almost to an army,was at length carried by assault (I.iv. x. 44, 45.)From this time the name of Saepinum disappearsfrom history, but it is found again at a later periodamong the municipal towns of Samnium under theRoman Empire. Its name is not indeed mentionedby Strabo, among the few surviving cities of Sam­nium iu his day; but it received a colony underNero {Lib. Colon. p. 237), and appears for a timeto have recovered some degree of importance. Itsname is found both in Ptolemy and Pliny among the municipal towns of Samnium; ami it is t from inscriptions that it did not bear tUtitieat aColonia.

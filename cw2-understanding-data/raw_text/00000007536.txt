But stillconflicts perpetually arose with the Grecians; and although thegovernors did every day punish many of them, yet did the sedi­tion grow worse ; but at this time especially, when there weretumults in other places also, the disorders among them were putinto a greater flame; for when the Alexandrians had once a pub­lic assembly, to deliberate about an ambassage they were send­ing to Nero, a great number of Jews came flocking to thetheatre ; but',when their adversaries saw them, they immediate­ly cried out, and called them their enemies, and said they cameas spies upon them ; upon which they rushed out, and laid vio­lent hands upon them ; and as for the rest, they were slain asthey ran away ; but there were three men whom they caught,and hauled them along, in order to have them burnt alive; butall the Jews came in a body to defend them, who at first threwstones at the Grecians, but after that they took lamps, andrushed with violence into the theatre, and threatened that theywould burn the people to a man: and this they had soon done,unless Tiberius Alexander, the governor' of the city, had re­strained their passions.

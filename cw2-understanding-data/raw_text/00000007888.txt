[Hispama,Vol. I. p. 1084.] PY"RETUS (nuerros), called by the ScythiansTl6para, described by Herodotus (iv. 48) as a largeriver of Scythia, flowing in an easterly direction andfalling into the Danube. The modern Pruth. PYRGI (nipyoi: Eth. Pyrgensis: Santo Se-vera), a city on the coast of Etruria, situatedbetween Alsium and Castrum Novum, and distant34 miles from Rome .{Kin. A nU p. 290.) It wasrather more than 6 miles (50 stadia) from Caere, ofwhich it served as the port (Strab. v. p. 226). butit is probable that it was not originally designed forthat purpose, but grow up in the first instancearound the temple of Eileithyia, for which it con­tinued to be celebrated at a much later period.(Strab. I c; Diod. xv. 14.) The foundation ofthis temple is expressly ascribed to the Pelasgians,and the pure Greek form of the name certainlytends to corroborate this statement. It is probablethat both Pyrgi and the neighbouring Caere wereoriginally Pelasgian settlements, and that this wasthe cause of the close connection between the two,which led to Pyrgi ultimately passing into the con­dition of a dependency on the more powerful cityof the interior. Virgil calls it an ancient city(Pyrgi veteres, Aen. x. 184), and represents it asone of the Tuscan cities that sent assistance toAeneas. But the only mention of Pyrgi in historyduring the period of Etruscan independence is inb. c. 384, when the treasures of its temple attractedthe cupidity of Dionysius of Syracuse, who made apiratical descent upon the coast of Etruria, and,landing his troops at Pyrgi in the night, surprisedand plundered the temple, from which he is said tohave carried off spoils to the value of 1000 talents.(Diod. xv. 14; Strab. v. p. 226; Arist. Oecon. ii.21; Polyaen. v. 2. 21.) The amount of the bootyseems incredible, but the temple was certainly verywealthy: and it would seem that the people ofPyrgi had given some excuse for the aggression, bythemselves taking an active part in the piraciescarried on at this period by the Etruscans in general.Servius, indeed, represents it as bearing the chiefpart in those depredations; but this may probablybe an exaggeration.

As for the number of those that were expelled out of Egypt,he hath contrived to have the very same number with Lysi-machus, and says they were a hundred and ten thousand. Hethen assigns a certain wonderful and plausible occasion forthe name of Sabbath ; for he says, that " when the Jews hadtravelled a six days journey, they had buboes in their groins;and that on this account it was that they rested on theseventh day, as having gotten safely to that country which isnow called Judea ; that then they preserved the language ofthe Egyptians, and called that day the Sabbath; for thatmalady of buboes in their groins was named Sabbatosis by theEgyptians."

However, our admirable authorApion had before told us, that " they came to Judea in sixdays time;" and again, that " Moses went up to a mountainthat lay between Egypt and Arabia, which was called Sinai,and was concealed there forty days, and that when he camedown from thence he gave laws to the Jews." But, then,how was it possible for them to tarry forty days in a desertplace, where there was no water, and at the same time to passall over the country between that and Judea in the six days?And as for this grammatical translation of the word Sabbath,it either contains an instance of his great impudence or grossignorance; for the words Sabbo and Sabbath are widely difÂ­

After Theseus had been driven out ofAthens he retired to Scyros, where he was firsthospitably received by Lycomedes, but was after­wards treacherously hurled into the sea from oneof the rocks in the island. It was to revenue hisdeath that Peleus sent Achilles to conquer theisland. (Plut. Thes. 35; Paus. i. 22. § 6; Philostr.Heroic. 19 ) Scyros is said to have been originallyinhabited by Pelasgians, Carinas, and Dolopians;and we know from Thucydides that the island wasstiil inhabited by Dolopians, when it was conqueredbyCimon after the Persian wars. (Kicolaus Damasc,ap. Steph. B. s. v.; Scyinn. Cb. 5S0, seq.; Thac. i.93; Diod. xi. 60.) In b. c. 476 an oracle haddirected the Athenians to bring home the bones ofTheseus; but it was not till b. c. 469 that theisland was conquered, and the bones conveyed toAthens, where they were preserved in the Theseium.Cimon expelled the Dolopians from the island, andpeopled it with Athenian settlers. (Thuc. Diod. ILcc.;Plut The*. 36, Can. 8; on the date of the conquestof Scyros, which Clinton erroneously places in h. c.476, see Grote, History of Greece, vol. v. p. 409.)From this time Scyros was subject to Athens, andwas regarded even at a later period, along withI,emnos and Imbros, as a possession to which theAthenians had special claims. Thus the peace ofAntalcidas, which declared the independence of allthe Grecian states, nevertheless allowed the Atheniansto retain possession of Scyros, Lemnos, and Imbros(Xen. Hell iv. 8. § 15, v. 1. §31); and though theMacedonians subsequently obtained possession ofthese islands, the Romans compelled Philip, in thepeace concluded in b. c. 196, to restore them to theAthenians. (Liv. xxxiii. 30.) The soil of Scyroswas unproductive (Dem. c. C'allip, p. 1238; Eustath.ad Horn. It. ii. p. 782 ; Suidas,#. u. apxh 2fcupi'a); butit was celebrated for its breed of goats, and for itsquarries of variegated marble. (Strab. ix. p. 437;Allien, i. p. 28, xii. p. 5-10; Zenob. ii. 18; Plin.xxxvi. 16. s. 26.) Scyros is divided into two parts by a narrowisthmus, of which the southern half consists of-highrugged mountains. The northern half is not somountainous. The modern town of St. George^ onthe eastern side of the island, stands upon the siteof the ancient town. It covers the northern andwestern sides of a high rocky peak, which to theeastward falls steeply to the sea; and hence Homercorrectly describes the ancient city as the loftyScyros (2,Kvpoi' aiiruav, H, i. 664). The Hellenicwalls are still traceable in many parts. The city wasbarely 2 miles in circumference. On the isthmussouth of Scyros a deep bay still retains the name ofAchilli ('Ax»'*^*)i which is doubtless the site of theAchilleion, or sanctuary of Achilles, mentioned byEu* tat hi us (ad II. ix. 662). Athena was thedivinity chiefly worshipped at Scyros. Her templestood upon the shore close to the town. (Stat.AchUl. i. 285, ii. 21.) Tournefort says that hesaw some remains of columns and cornices of whitenimble, close by a forsaken chapel, on the left bandgoing into the fort of St. George; these are probablyremains of the temple of Athena. (Tournefort,Voyage, vol. i. p. 334, trans.; Leake, NorthernGreece, vol. iii. p. 106, seq.; Fiedler, Reise, vol. ii.p. 66; Ross, Wanikrungm in Griechenland^ toI. ii.p. 32, seq.)

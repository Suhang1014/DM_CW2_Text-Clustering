But when she was once dead, the king's affections for herwere kindled in a more outrageous manner than before, whoseold passion for her we have already described: for his love to helTvas not of a calm nature, nor such as we usually meet with amongother husbands, for at its commencement it was of an enthusiastickind, nor was it by their long cohabitation and free conversationtogether, brought under his power to manage; but at this timehis love to Mariamne seemed to seize him in such a peculiarmanner, as looked like divine vengeance upon him, for the tak­ing away her life, for he would frequently call for her, and fre­quently lament for her in a most indecent manner.

In the solitude of Comum, which hadonce been animated by the mild genius of Pliny, a trans­parent basin, above sixty miles in length, still reflectedthe rural seats which encompassed the margin of theLarian lake; and the gradual ascent of the hills was co­vered by a triple plantation of olives, of vines, and ofchesnut trees.1 Agriculture revived under the shadowof peace, and the number of husbandmen was multipliedby the redemption of captives.4 The iron mines of Dal-matia, a gold mine in Bruttium, were carefully explored,and the Pomptine marshes, as well as those of Spoleto,were drained and cultivated by private undertakers, whosedistant reward must depend on the continuance of thepublic prosperity."

Such deeds are the best of miracles. * The political economy of Theodoric (see Anonym.

PAMPHY'LIA (UaupvK'ta), a country on thesouth coast of Asia .Minor, bordering in tiie west onLycia, in the north on Pisidiu, and in the east onCilicia. The country, consisting of only a narrow.strip of cnast, forms an arch round the bay, whichis called after it the Paniphylius Sinus or the Pam-phylium Maro. According to Pliny (v. 26) thecountry was originally called Mopsopsia, from Mops us,a leader of one of those bands of Greeks who afterthe Trojan W ar are said to have settled in Pam-phylia, Cilicia, and Syria. (Strab. xiv. p. COS; comp.Scylax, p. 39; Ptol. v. 5; Dionys. Per. 850, &c;Pomp. Mela, i- 14 : Staditum. Mar.May. § 194,&c;Iticrocl. p. 079, &e.) Painphylia, according to Strabo,extended from Olbi.i to Ptolemais, a line measuring640 stadia, or about 18 geographical miles: thebreadth of the country, from the coast towards theinterior, was nowhere above a few miles. In latertimes, however, the Romans applied the name Pam-phylia in such a manner as to embrace Pisidia onboth sides of Mount Taurus, which does not nj pearas a distinct province of the empire until the newdivision under Constantine was made. This accountsfor the fact of Polybius (xxii. 27) doubting whetherPainphylia (in the Roman sense) was one of thecountries beyond or this side of Mount Taurus;for Pisidia, in its n.irrower sense, is unquestionablya country beyond Mount Taurus. (Comp. Strab.xii. p. 570, xiv. p. 632, xv. p 6i*5.) In this latternenso Painphylia was separata! from Lycia by MonntClimax, and from Cilicia by the river Melas, andaccordingly embraced the districts called in moderntimes Ttk'he and the coast district of Jtshil. Butthese limits were not always strictly observed; forOlbia anil Perge are described by some writers asbelonging to Lycia (Scylax. p. 39); while Ptolemais,beyond the Melas, which is generally regarded asbelonging to Piimphylia, is assigned by some to Ci-licia. The country of Painphylia is, on the whole,very mountainous; for the ramifications of MountTaurus rise in some parts on the coast itself, and inothers at a distance of only a few miles from it.There is only one great promontory on the coast, viz.Leucotheum, or Leueolla. The principal rivets, allof which discharge their waters into the Pamphylianbay, are the Catahkhac li s, Ckstius, EritY-mkhon, and Mklas, all of width are navigable.The cast district between the Oestrus and Eury-lned"n contains the lake Capri a, which is of con­siderable extent. The inhabitants of Painphylia, Pamphyli, that is,n mixture uf various races, consisted of aboriginesmixed with Cilicians who hail immigrated: to thesewere added bands of Greeks after the Trojan War,and Liter (Jreek colonies. (Strab. I.e.; Eustath. mlJ)'um. Per. 854; Herod, vii. 91, viii. 6S; Pans. vii.3. § 3; Appian, H. C. ii. 71. iv. 00; Liv. xliv. U.)The Pamphylians (Pamphyli, Pamphylii, Udu<pv\oitTlafj.(t>vAioi), accordingly, were in those parts whatthe Alemanni were in (lennaiiy, though the currenttraditions related that they were all descended fromPamphyle, a daughter of Khaeius and Manto (Steph.Ii. s. v. na;oJ>iA.a). or from one Pamphylus (Eus­tath. ad D'um. Per. I. r ). Others aLrain, thoughwithout g<«od reason, derive the mime from xas andipi;\Aov, because the country was rich in wood. ThePamphylians never acquired any gre.it power or ]*■-litical importance; they shared the fate of all thenations of Asia Minor, and in the war of Xerxes aca'mst the Cirecks their naval con:injeot c«w»of only 3i» ships, while the Ltcuiu fonu*W 5*and the Cilicians 100.

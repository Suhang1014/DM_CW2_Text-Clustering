Triocalinas: Ra. i), a thy of Sicily, situated in | the Interior of the island, about 12 miles fromI Thermae Selinnntiae (Sciocco). As the name iscited by Stephanas of Byzantium (who writes thename TphraAa) from Philistas, it is probable thatit was a Siculian town or fortress as early at leastas the time of the elder Dionysius; but no notice ofit is now found in history until the second ServileWar in Sicily in B. c. 103—100. On that occasionTriucala was selected, on account of its great na­tural strength and other advantages, by Tryphon,the leader of the insurgents, as bis chief stronghold:he fortified the rocky summit on which it wassituated, and was able to hold out there, as in animpregnable fortress, after his defeat in the field byL. Lucullus. (Diod. xxxvi. 7, 8.) The circum­stances of its fall are not related to us, but Siliusllalicus aliudes to it as having suffered severelyfrom the effects of the war. (" Servili vastataTriocala bello,*' xiv. 270). Cicero nowhere noticesthe name among the municipal towns of Sicily, butin one passage mentions the 44 Triocalinas ager"(Kerr. v. 4); and the Triocalini again appear inPliny's fist of the municipal towns of Sicily. Thename is also found in Ptolemy, bat in a mannerthat gires little information as to its position.(Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. § 14.) It was anepiscopal see during the early part of the middleages, and the site is identified by Fazello, who tellsus that the ruins of the city were still visible in histime a short distance from CalatabeUoUa. a town ofSaracen origin, situated on a lofty hill about 12miles inland from Sciacca; and an old church onthe site still preserved the ancient apprllation.(Fasell. de M.

Onthe summit of this promontory a temple of Apollo,hence called the Triopian, seems to hare stood, bearwhich games were celebrated, whence Scylax callathe promontory the da-pw-rtyMor wpoV. Accordingto some authorities the town of Cnidus itself alsobore the name of Triopium, having, it is said, beenfuunded by Triopas. (Steph. B. «. r.

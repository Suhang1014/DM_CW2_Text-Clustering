[L. S.] SABA'RIA (Saoucifjia). an important town inthe north of Upper I'annonia, was situated in a plainbetween the river Arr&bo anil the Deserts Bciorum, onthe road from Carnuntum to Poetovium. The town,which seems to have been an ancient settlement ofthe Moii, derived it.-s importance partly from tlie ferti­lity of the plain in which it was situated, and partlyfrom the fact that it formed a kind of central point atwhich several roads met. The emperor Claudiusraised it to the rank of a Roman colon/, whence itreceived the surname of Claudia. (Plin, iii. 27;Ptol, ii. 1"). § -4.) In this town Septimius Severuswas proclaimed Augustus (Ante!. Vict. EpiL 19),and the emperor Valentinian resided there somelime. (Amm. Marc. xxx. ">.) Owing to this andother circumstances, the town rose to a high decreeof prosperity during the latter period of the liomanEmpire; and its ancient givatness is still attested byits numerous remains of temples and aqueducts.Many statues, inscriptions, and coins also have beenfound at Stein am Anyer, which is the modernname, or, as the Hungarians call it, Sznmbatheltj.{It.

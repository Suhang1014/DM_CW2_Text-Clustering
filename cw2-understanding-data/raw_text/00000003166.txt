As soon as it was day, and the king was come mto thatwilderness which is under the city of Tekoa, he said to the mul­titude, That " they ought to give credit to what the prophet had"said, and not to set themselves in array for fighting, but to set"the priests with their trumpets, and the Levites, with the sing-"ers of hymns, to give thanks to God, as having already deliver-"ed our country from our enemies." This opinion of the kingpleased [the people], and they did what he advised them to do.So God caused a terror and a commotion to arise among the Am­monites, who thought one another to be enemies, and slew oneanother, insomuch that not one man out of so great an armyescaped: and when Jehoshaphat looked upon that valley whereintheir enemies had been encamped, and saw it full of dead men; herejoiced at so surprising an event, as was this assistance of God,while he himself by his own power, and without their labour,had given them the victory.

He was also in friendshipwith Ahab's son, who was king of Israel: and he joined withhim in the building of ships that were to sail to * Pontus, and the * What are here Pontus and Thrace, as the places whither Jehoshaphat's fleetsailed, are in our other copies Opkir and Tttrshish, and the place whence it sailedis in them Eziongeber, which lay on the Red Sea, whence it was impossible for anyships to sail to Pontus or Thrace; so that Josephus' copy differed from cur othercopies, as is farther plain from his own words, which render what we read, that theships were broken at Eriongeber, from their unwieldy greutnes*. But so far wemay conclude, that Josephus thought one Ophir to be somewhere in the Medi­terranean, and not in the South Sea, though perhaps there might be another Ophirin that South Sea also, and that fleets might then sail both from Phoenicia, andfrom tii.

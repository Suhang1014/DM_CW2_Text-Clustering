OCR Output TIGRIS. TILURIUM. r*in* to the SW., it completely unites with thativer, at a place called by Pliny {I. c.) Digha, 1000itidia above their common embouchure in theVrMan gulf. Many of the ancients were aware thatbe two rivers joined one another, and had a com-n.-ti mouth (Plin. to.; Strab. ii. p. 79; Procop.?. P. i. 17, &c), whilst others were of opinion thatbe Euphrates had a separate embouchure (Onesi-rirot, qp. Strnb. xv. p. 729; Arrian, A nab. I.e.;iad /net 41; Nearch. p, 37, Huds.). But evenIi — who recognised their junction were not agreed*tn which stream it was that received the other,fvi whether their united course, now the Skat-el-tni/i, xliould I* called Tigris or Euphrates. Mustinter* adopted the former name, but Nenrchus and^nicritus preferred that of the Euphrates (cf.in*ri, indie, 41). It is not impossible, however,f it the Euphrates may at one time have h.-id a'pnratemonth (cf. Plin. I c; Ritter, Erdk. x. p. 27).here was also a difference of opinion ns to theimlier of mouths by which the united streammftiad itaelf into the Persian gulf. Its western ulhs were entirely unknown to the ancient-■••cks, m Antiochus Epiphane* was the first whouw*l the cttist to the \V. of the Tigris to berrnrstery surveyed; and amongst later conquerors,'njin alone penetrated ns far as this neighbour'nod. Hence the ancient Greeks, as well as Pliny\.c.\ apeak of only one mouth, the breadth oftieo is given by the latter at 10 miles. Ptolemy,owever, mentions two mouths (vi. 3. § 2) at a•lance tif \ \ degrees apart, which is confirmed by•mwcritua (ap. Phila-torg. Hist. Eccl. iii. 7, 8), «*>iing to whom the island between these mouthsinhabited by the Meseni. But probably by the*-r?rn mouth was meant that of the river Eulaeus, * jirewn; Karun, one arm of which unites with** Tigris, whilst the other falls into the sea by aniflVpendent nvwth. This river was also calledvitigris by the ancients (Jlaairtypts, Strab. xv. p.29), that is, w the little Tigris," from the oldrrvAn word pas, Mgnifying " small;" whence also the modern Persians it bears the name of•i-ijiahi-Kudal; which means the same thing,ewe we may explain how the united stream of»t Tigris and Euphrates itself was throughout itsnrw called Pasitigris by some writers (Strab. /. c;da. I e,); whiUt others regarded the Pasitigris asrite a separate stream, rising in the territory of * Uxii, and disemboguing into the Persian gulfwinn. ap. Strab. 1. c; Arrian, fnd. 42; Diodor.'ii. 67; Curt t. 3, init). This last view would»ke it Identical with the present Karun (cf!';rwir, Mem. p. 59; Gosselin, Recherches, <ft\ ii. 86, sqq; Vincent, Peript. iii. p. 67, not. Ac),be other affluents of the Tigris were the Nice- -nm or Centritis, the Zabatus or Lycus, the'irrudu*. the Ciiprus, the Tornadolus or Torna,ijatrmtly the same as the Physcus of Xenophontmb. ii. 4. § 25). the Gyndes or Delas, the'oaspea, and the Coprates, which fell into the•in stnaio after joining the Eulaeus. All these -r* were on the left or eastern bank of the Tigris.> stream of the Tigris was very rapid, and•^ordrajr to Strabo (p. 529) from its very source; Pliny (£. c.) more correctly ascribes thistiiilT only to it* lower course. It was, in fact,mg to the large quantity of water which thejris received by means of the canals which-nected it with the Euphrates, none of which wasturned through the same channel*, owing to the bed of the Tigris being at a lower level. (Arrian,/. c; Dion Cuss, lxviii. 28; Slrab. /. c; Hor. Od. iv.14, 46; Lncan, iiL 256, &c.) In ancient timesmany dams had been constructed in its course fromOpis to its mouth, designed to retain its waters forthe purpose of irrigating the adjoining districts(cf. Heeren, Jdeen, i. 2. p. 171; Tavcrnicr, Voyage*,i. p. 185; Niebuhr, Jteise, ii. p. 243). These,how­ever, were all cut through by Alexander, in orderto improve the navigation, which began as high upas Opis (Arrian, L r.; Strab. 739, sq.) BetweenMogul and the confluence of the greater Zab, and3 hours'journey above the latter, there still remainsan ancient dam of masonry thrown across the stream(Ritter, Erdkmde, x. p. 5, sqq.> [T. H.

It is themost considerable rirer in this |«rt of Italy, and,like all the neighbouring rivers, is subject to beswollen by floods and winter rains, so that it leavesa broad bed of shingle, great part of which is dryat ordinary seasons. The name is found in Plinyand Ptolemy; and it is doubtless the same riverwhich is described by Strabo, though without men­tioning its name, as separating the territory ofAquileia from the province of Vewtia, and whichhe says was navigable for 1200 stadia from itsmouth. (Strab. v. p. 214.) This last statementis indeed a great exaggeration; but the valley ofthe Tagliamento is one of the natural openings ofthis part of the Alps, and was followed by the lineof a Roman road, which proceeded from Aquileiaby Julium Carnicum {Zugtio) over the jiass of theMonte di Sta Croce into the valley of the Gail.[Aumcn, p. 110.] Pliny speaks (l c.) of a "Tilaventnm tnajusminusque," but it is impossible to say what river homeant to designate under the latter appellation.The name is written in the Tabula 44 Tiliabinte,"while it assumes very nearly its modern form in thoGeographer of Ravenna.

The oU name,however, continued in use f*>r a long lime; for inthe kalian charts of tlift middle ages we find thetown called Pamlico or Fundico, as well as liosjtroor I 'utpro. The walls of the city were repaired by Justinian.(Pnx'op. </e Aedif. iii. 7.) The site of Pantieapacum is well described byStnibo. "Pantieapaeuin," be says, " is a hill, 20btailia in circumference, covered with buildings onevery Mile : towards the cast it has a harbour anddocks tor 30 ships ; it has aUo a citadel" (vii.p. .i'.io). The hill is now called the Arm-chair ofMithridates. The modern town of Kertch stands atthe fool lit the hill, a great part of it upon alluvialsoil, the site of which was probably covered by the seain ancient times Hence tlie hay on the northern sideof the city appears to have advanced originally muchfurther into the land; and there was probably atone time a second port on the southern side, of whichthere now remains only a small lake, separated fromthe sea by a bar of sand. Foundations of ancientbuildings and heaps of brick and pottery are stillscattered over the hill of Mithridates; but the mostremarkable ancient remains are the numerous tu­muli round Kertch, in which many valuable worksof art have been discovered, and of which a full ac­count is riven in the works mentioned below. Themost extraordinary of these tumuli are (hone of thekings situated at the mountain called Altun-Ul»tt orth«' golden mountain, by the Tartars. One of thetumuli is in the form of a cone, 100 feet high and450 feet in diameter, and cased on its exterior withlarge blocks of .-lone, cubes of 3 or 4 feet, placedwithout cement or mortar. This remarkable monu­ment has been at all times the subject of mysteriouslegends, but the entrance to it was not discoveredtill 1832. Tins entrance led to a gallery, con­structed of layers of worked stone without cement,fit J feet long and 10 feet InVh, at the end of whichwas a vaulted chamber, 35 feet high and 20 feet indiameter, the floor of which was 10 feet below thefloor of the entrance. This chamber, however, wasempty, though on the ground was a large squaret>t <ui\ on which a sarcophagus might have rested.Thi> tumului stands at a spot nhere two branchesol a loriu' rampart meet, which extends N. to the Seaof Azof and SK. to the Bosporus just above Nymph-aeum. It was probably tin- ancient boundary of theterritory of Panticapaeum and of the kingdom ofthe Bosporus, before the conquest of Nymphaeumand Theudnsia. Within the rampart, 150 paces tothe E., there is another monument of the same kind,hut unfinished. It consists of a circular esplanade,500 paces round and 166 in diameter, with an ex­terior covering of Cyclopean masonry, built of workedstones, 3 feet long and high, of which there areonly five layers. But the L'reate-t discovery hasbeen at the lull, called by the Tartars Kut-Obo, orthe hill of cinders, which is situated outside of theancient rampart, and 4 miles from Kertch, Hereis a tumulus 165 feel in diameter; and as somesoldiers were carrying away from it in 1830 thestones with which it was covered, they accidentallyopened a passage into the interior, A vestibule, 6teet Bquare, led into a tomb 15 feet long; and 14broad, which contained bones of a king and queen,golden and silver vases, and other ornaments. Belowthis tomb was another, still richer; and from thetwo no less than 120 [rounds' weight of g.il orna­ments are said to haw been extracted.

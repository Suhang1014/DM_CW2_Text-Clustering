IV.] JERUSALEM. 175 Now that wall began on the north, at the tower called Eip-picus, and extended as far as the Xistus, a place so called,and then joining to the council-house, ended at the westcloister of the temple. But if we go the other way westward,it began at the same place, and extended through a placecalled Bethso to the gate of the Essens; and after that itwent southward, having its bending above the fountain Siloam,where it also bends again towards the east at Solomon's pool,and reaches as far as a certain place which they calledOphlas, where it was joined to the eastern cloister of thetemple. The second wall took its beginning from that gatewhich they called Gennath, which belonged to the first wall;it only encompassed the northern quarter of the city, andreached as far as the tower Antonia.

This new-built part of thecity was called Bezetha, in our language, which, if interpreted

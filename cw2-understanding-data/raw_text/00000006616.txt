But a great consternation had seized the wholeassembly of united Greece, lest the Lacedæmoniansshould return with an armed force; more especially,when Lichas, the son of Archesilaus, a Lacedæmonian,was scourged in the course by the under-osficers, be­cause, when his chariot had gained the prize, and thechariot of the Bœotian State was proclaimed victor,pursuant to the exclusion of the Lacedæmonians sromthe race, he stepped into the midst of the assembly, andcrowned the charioteer, desirous to make it knownthat the chariot belonged to him. Upon this, thewhole assembly was more than ever alarmed, and it wasfully expected that some strange event would follow:The Lacedæmonians, however, made no bustle > andthe festival passed regularly through its train. After the Olympics, the Argives and their consede­rates repaired to Corinth, in order to solicit the concur­rence of that State. A Lacedæmonian embassy hap­pened also to be there. Many conserences were held,and nothing finally determined; but, upon feeling theshock of an earthquake, they parted each to their re­spective cities. And here the summer ended. In the ensuing winter, a battle was fought, by theHaracleots of Trachis, against the Ænianians, and Do-lopians, and Meliensians, and some of the Thessalians.For the bordering nations were enemies to the cityof Heraclea, as this latter place had been fortified fortheir more especial annoyance. From its foundationthey had ever opposed it, preventing its growth to theutmost of their power; and at this time they deseated theHeracleots in a battle, in which Xenares, the son of Cni-dis, the Lacedæmonian commandant, was stain; anumber also of the Heracleots perished. And thus thewinter ended: and the twelfth year of the war came al­so to an end. YEAR

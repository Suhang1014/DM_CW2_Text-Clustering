Homer (Od. ix.40, 198) speaks of Ismarus as a town of the Cicones,on or at the foot of the mountain. (Coinp. Marc.Heracl. 28.) The name of the town also appears inthe form Ismaron. (I'lin. iv. 18.)

Itis mentioned by Scylax (p. 8) as a Grecian colony,which, according to Scymnus of Chios (L 412), wassent from Syracuse. Dindnrns (xv. 13) relates thatin n. c 3S7 Diunysius the elder, in his attempts tosecure to himself the sovereignty of the Adriatic,assisted the Parians in founding colonies at Issa amiPharos. The island was besifged by Agnm, kingof Illyria, and the inhabitants applied to Rome forprotection, when a message was sent by the Romansto Agnm, requiring him to desist from molesting thefriends of the republic In the mean time, n, c. 232,Apron died; and his widow Teuta, having succeededto the throne, resolved on pressing the siege of Issa.The Roman envoys required her to cease from hos­tilities, when, in defiance of the law of nations, sheput one of them to death. This brought on the Firstlllyrian War. B. (-. 229; one of the consequences ofwhich was the liberation of Issa. (Polyb. ii. 8; Ann. lllyr. 7.) That Issa remained free for a long timeis proved by its coins, which also show that theisland was famous for its wine (comp. Athen. i. p.22), bearing, as they do, an "amphora" on oneside, and on the other a vine with leaves. ( K- l.h-).vol. ii. p. 159.) The inhabitants were expert tea­men, atid their beaked ships, " Lembi Issaici," ren­dered the Romans especial service in the war withPhilip of Maccdon. (Liv. xxxL 45, xxxvii. 16,xlii. 48.) They were exempted from the )«ymmiof tribute (Liv. xlv. 8), and were reckoned as Romancitizens (Piin. iii. 21). In the time of Caesar thechief town of this island appears to have been nxyflourishing. The island now called Luua rises from the sea. tothat it is seen at a considerable distance; it has twoports, the larger one on the XE. side, with a townof the same name: the soil is barren,and wine formaits chief produce.

B. : V.; inthe Roman writers the usual form is "E«se-dones"), a people living to the E. of the Arg'p-paci, and the most remote of the tribes of Cen­tral Asia with whom the Hellenic colonies onthe Euxine had any communication. The nameis found as early as the Spartan Alcman, n. c. 671—631, who calls them "Assedones" (». 94,ed. Welcker), and Hecataeus (/V.I68. ed. Klau-scn). A great movement among the nomad tril«-s ofthe N. had taken place in very remote titnr~. fal­lowing a direction from XE. toSW.; theArimaspihad driven out the Issedones fmm the steppes overwhich tliry wandered, and they in turn droveout the Scythians, and the Scythians the Cim­merians. Traces of these migrations were indicatedin the poem of Aristcas of Proomnesns, a -rmi-mythical |«rsonage, whoso pilgrimage to the land i.fthe Issedones was strangely disfigured after hisdeath by the fables of the Milesian colonist*. (Herod,iv. 13.) The Issedones, according to Herodotus (iv.26), have a custom, when any one loses his father,for the kinsfolk to kill a certain number of sheep,whose flesh they hash up together with that of thedead man, and make merry over it. This done,they peel and clean out his skull, which after it hasbeen gilded becomes a kind of idol to which yearlysacrifices are offered. In all other respects they area righteous people, submitting to the rule of wimrnequally with that of men ; in other words, a civilian!people. Heeren (Atiat.

OCR Output NOTES ON THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER. lxxxiii [103] See Mostieim, p. 97. Sulpicius Severuswas the first author of this computation ; thoughhe seemed desirous of reserving the tenth and greatestpersecution for the coming of the Antichrist. [104] The testimony given by Pontius Pilate isfirst mentioned by Justin. The successive improve­ments which the story has acquired, (as it passedthrough the hands of Tertullian, Eusebius, Epi-phaniu9, Chrysostom, Orosius, Gregory of Tours,and the authors of the several editions of the acts ofPilate) are very fairly stated by Dom Calmet, Disser­tations fur 1 Ecriture, torn. iii. p. 651, Sec. [105] On this miracle, as it is commonly called,of the thundering legion, see the admirable criti­cism of Mr. Moyle, in his Works, vol. ii. p.81—£90. [106] Dion Cassias, or rather his abbreviatorXiphilin, 1. lxxii. p.. 1206. Mr. Moyle (p. 266)has explained the condition of the church under thereign of Commodus. [107] Compare the life of Caracalla in the Au­gustan History, with the Epistle of Tertullian toScapula. Dr. Jortin (Remarks on EcclesiasticalHistory, vol. ii. p. j, 4ec.) considers the cure of Seve­rus, by the means of holy oil, with a strong desireto convert it into a miracle, [108] Tertullian de Faga, c. 13. The presentwas made during the feast of the Saturnalia; andit is a matter of serious concern to Tertullian, thatthe faithful should be confounded with the most in­famous professions which purchased the connivanceof the government. [109] Euseb. 1. v. c. 23, 24. Mostieim, p.435—447- [no] Jud.-eos fieri sub gravi pœna vetuit. Idemetiam de Christianis sanxit. Hist. August, p. 70. [111] Sulpicius Severus, 1. ii, p. 384. This com­putation (allowing for a single exception) is con­firmed by the history of Eusebius, and by thewritings of Cyprian. '[112] The antiquity of Christian churches is dis­cussed by Tillemont (Memoires Ecclefiastiques, torn,iii. Part ii. p. 68—72.), and by Mr. Moyle (vol.i.p. 378—39S). The former refers the first con­ struction of them to the peace of Alexander Severus;the latter, to the peace of Gallienus. [113] Seethe Augustan History, p. 130. TheEmperor Alexander adopted their method of public­ly proposing the names of those persons who werecandidates for ordination. It is true, that the ho­nour of this practice is likewise attributed to theJews. [114] Euseb. Hist. Ecclesiast. 1. vi. c. 21. Hiero-nym. de Script. Eccles. c. 54. Mamæa was styleda holy and pious woman, both by the Christians andthe Pagans. From the former, therefore, it was im­possible that she should deserve that honourableepithet. [115] See the Augustan History, p. 123. Mo­stieim (p. 46;) seems to refine too much on thedomestic religion of Alexander. His design ofbuilding a public temple to Christ (Hist. August, p.129.), and the objection which was suggested either tohim, or in similar circumstances to Hadrian, appearsto be an improbable report, invented by the Christi­ans, and credulously adopted by an historian of theage of Constantine, [116] Euseb. 1. vi. c. 98. [117] Orosius, 1. vii, c. 19, mentions Origen asthe object of Maximin's resentment; and Firmili-anus, a Cappadocian bishop of that age, gives a justand confined idea of this persecution (apud Cyprian.Epist. 75.) [118] The mention of those princes who werepublicly supposed to be Christians, as we find it in anepistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. 1.vii. c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his fa­mily; and forms a contemporary evidence, thatsuch a report had prevailed; but the Egyptianbishop, who lived at an humble distance from thecourt of Rome, expresses himself with a becomingdiffidence, concerning the truth of the fact. Theepistles of Origen (which were extant in the time ofEusebius, see 1. vi.e. 36,) would most probably de­cide this curious, rather than important question. [119] Euseb. I, vj. c. 34.; The story, as is usual,has been embellished by succeeding writers, and isconfuted, with much superfluous learning, by Fre?derick Spanheim (Opera Varia, torn. ii. p. 490, &c.) 1 2 [no] Lac-

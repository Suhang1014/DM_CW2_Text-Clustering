TRAJECTUM. for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge Trnjanopolisis placed on the Egnatiau Way at a considerable dis­tance \V. of the Hebrus, and at a point which fulfilstolerably well the conditions of distance from thetwo places above mentioned. Trajanopolis became the capital of the province ofRhodopc, and continued to be a place of importanceuntil the fourth century.

[Dioundum.] L.] TRAIS. [Trakss.] TRALLES or TRALLIS (TpctAAeis, TpdAAir:Eth. Tpa.Wia.v6s), a large and nourishing city ofCaria, on the southern slope of mount Messogis, alittle to tlie north of the Scamander, a small tribu­tary of which, the Eudon, flowed close by tlie city,while another passed right through it. Its acropolisi\as situated una lofty eminence in the north of thecity. Tralles was said to have been founded by Ar-gives in conjunction with a body of Thraeians, whenceits name Tralles was believed to he derived (Strab.xiv. pp. 648, 649; Hesych, s. p.; Diod. Sic. xvii. 65;Plut. Age*. 16). for it is said to have previously beencalled Anthea, Eranthea, Erymna, Charax, Seleucia,and Antiochia (Steph. 15. 5. pp. TpoAAii, Xdpa£;Etym. SI. p. 381*; Plin. r. 29). Others, however,st:ite that it was a Pelasgian colony, and originallybora the name of Larissa (Agath. ii. 17; Schol. adHorn. II. x. 42'J). It was situated in a most fertiledistrict, at a point where highroads met from thesouth, east, and west; so that it must have been aplace of considerable commerce. (Cic. ad Alt. v.14, ad Fam. iii. 5, ad Quint. Frat. i. 1; Strab. xiv.p. 663.) The inhabitants of Tralles were celebratedfor their great wealth, and were generally appointedasiarchs, that is, presidents of the games celebratedin the district. But the country in which Tralleswas situated was much subject to earthquakes;in the reign of Augustus many of its public build­ings were greatly damaged by a violent shock; andthe emperor gave the inhabitants a handsome sumof money to repair the losses they had sustained.(Strab. xii. p. 579.) Out of gratitude, the Trallianspetitioned to be permitted to erect a temple in honour of Tiberius, bnt without efT<>ct. (Tit .ha tr. Si)According to Pliny (xxxv. 49\ king At&lobrfipalace at Tralles.

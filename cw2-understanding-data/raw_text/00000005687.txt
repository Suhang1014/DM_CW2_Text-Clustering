Polygnotuslikewise has painted in this picture Laodice standing be­yond the altar. I do not know of any poet that hasmentioned her among the Trojan captives; and it ap­pears to me very probable that she was dismissed by theGreeks. Homer, indeed, in the Iliad, evinces that Mene-laus and Ulysses were entertained by Antenor, and thatLaodice was married to Helicaon the son of Antenor.Lescheus asserts, that Helicaon being wounded in the noc­turnal engagement, was known by Ulysses, and freed fromthe danger of the fight. It may therefore be easily be­lieved, that neither Agamemnon nor Menelaus would actin an hostile manner towards the wife of Helicaon. How­ever, Eupherion Chalcidensis asserts things respectingLaodice, which are utterly void of probability. AsterLaodice there is a stone prop, on which there is a brazenlaver. Medusa sits on the ground, holding this prop with■both her hands. Any one may rank Medusa among thedaughters of Priam, who has read the ode of Himeraeus.Near Medusa there is an eld woman with her hair shaven,to the skin; or perhaps this may be an eunuch. Sheholds a naked infant on her knees: and the infant is re­presented hcjding his hand before his eyes, through fear. CHAP.

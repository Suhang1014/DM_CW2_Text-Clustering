These isles aresituated over-against the shore of the Siculi and the Messe-nians, and were allied with Syracuse. The Athenians hav­ing plundered the soil, and finding the inhabitants would notcome in, put back again to Rhegium.—And here the win­ter ended, and the fifth year of this war, the history of whichThucydides hath compiled. YEAR VI. THE following summer, the Peloponnesians and confede­rates assembled at the Isthmus, in order to make the usualinroad into Attica ; and Agis, son of Archidamus, king ofthe Lacedaemonians, was there ready for the command. Butthe frequent earthquakes which happened about this time,caused them to return back, and entirely put a stop to thedesigned incursion. About the same space of time shocks of earthquakeswere felt in Euboea, where at Orobi* the sea breaking overwhat was then land with impetuous swells, laid a part ofthat city under water: Some of which stagnated there,though some washed its way back: however a tract nowcontinues sea which before was land. All those who couldnot reach the higher grounds in time, by running beforethe surge, were drowned.—A similar inundation happenedat the isle of Atalanta, amongst the Locrians of Opus,where it washed away the Athenian fort, and of two ves­sels that lay dry upon the beach staved one to pieces. . - • So Virgil, L viii. 416.

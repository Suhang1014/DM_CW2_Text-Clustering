Mela,ii. 3. § 11; Plin. iii. 26), a people of Grecian IBy-ricum, who may be placed to the N. in the neigh­bourhood of Epidamnus, and, consequently, next tothe Taulantii. They are often mentioned in thecourse of the war with Illyricum, B.C. 229, but asfriends rather than foes of the Romans, havingsubmitted at an early period to their arms. (Polyb.ii. 11; Liv. xxix. 12.) After the death of Philip,king of Macedon, they appear to have been added tothe dominions of Pleuratus, an lllyrian prince alliedto the Romans. (Polyb. xviii. 30; Liv. xxx. 34,xliv. 30.) Their principal town was Parthus(ndptfos, Steph. B. *. v.), which was taken byCaesar in the course of his campaign with Pom-peius. (Caes. B. C. iii. 41.) In Leake's map thesite is marked at Ardhenitzai^?). The double-lulledOiinalltim, the strongest among the lllyrian places,with two citadels on two heights, connected by awall (Polyb. iii. 18, vii. 9), was within their terri­tory. There is no indication, however, of its precisesituation, which was probably between Lissus andEpidamnus. Of Ecgenium and Bakgulum, twoother fortresses noticed by Livy (xxix. 12), nothingfurther is known. [E. B. J.] PARTHEXIAS. [Harpina.] PARTHE'NIUM (t6 napeeVioc 6pos), a moun­tain on the frontiers of Arcadia and Argolis, acrosswhich there was an important pass leading fromArgos to Tegea. [See Vol. L pp. 201, 202 ](Paus. viii. 6. § 4; Strab. viii. pp. 376, 389; Po­lyb. iv. 23; Liv. xxxiv. 26; Plin. iv. 6. s. 10.) Itwas sacred to Pan; and it was upon this mountainthat the courier Phcidippides said that he had hadan interview with Pan on returning from Sparta,whither he had gone to ask assistance for thoAthenians shortly before the battle of Marathon.(Herod, vi. 105; Paus. i. 28. § 4, viii. 54. § 6.)The pass is still called Partheni, but the wholemountain bears the name of KMno. It is 3993feet in height. (Leake, 3/orea, vol. ii. p. 329, seq.;Ptlopimncsiaca, p. 203.) PARTHE'NIUM (Jlaftinov), a town in Myaa,in the south of Pergamum. (Xenoph.

[T.H D.] PARTHE'NIUS (riopSfnos), the most importantriver in the west of Paphhuionia. It owes its Greekname probably to a similarity in the sound of itsnative appellation, which is still liartan-Su or Bar.<«ne; though Greek authors fabled that it derivedits name from the fact that Artemis loved to bathein its waters (Scymn. 226, foil.) or to hunt on itsbanks, or from the purity of its waters. Theriver has its sources on mount Olgassys, and in itsnorth-western course formed the boundary betweenPaphlagonia and Bithynia. It empties itself intothe Euxine about 90 stadia west of Amastris.

OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXI. 247 have presented myself before you, as I would not ap­pear in the character either of a deputy from Hannibal,or of a deserter. But since he has remained with yourenemy, either through his own fault, or yours : throughhis own, if he counterfeited fear; through yours, if hewho tells you truth is to be punished : I have come toyou, out of my regard to the ties of hospitality so longsubsisting between us, in order that you should not beignorant that there are certain conditions on which youmay obtain both peace and safety.

These are the terms which,as a victorious enemy, he enjoins: with these, grievousand afflicting as they are, your present circumstancescounsel yon to comply. I do not indeed despair butthat, when the intire -disposal of every thing is givenup to him, he may remit somewhat of the severity ofthese'articles. But even these, I think it advisable to

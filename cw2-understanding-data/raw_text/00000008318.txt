The former supposition is possible, hut not the latter, for Strabo places Olbc inthe interior of Cilicia, between the rivers Lamus andCydnus, that is, in the mountainous districts of theTaurus. According to tradition, Olbe had beenbuilt by Ajax, the son of Teucer; it contained atemple of Zeus, whose priest once ruled over allCilicia Aspera. (Strab. I. c.) In later times it wasregarded as belonging to Isauria, and was the seat ofa bishop. (Hieroel. p. 709; Basil. Vil. Theclae, ii.8.) We still possess coins of two of those priestlyprinces, Polemon and Ajax. (Eckhel, Doctr. Num.vol. iii. p. 26, &c.) It should be observed thatStephanus Bvz. (*. v.

Pliny (iv. 26)says that it was anciently called Olbiopolis, andMiLKToroLis; the former of these names does notoccur elsewhere, and is derived probably from theethnic name Olbiopolitae ('OA<>ioiroA»Tai, Herod,iv. 18; Snid. s. v. noo-etSttVios), which appears oncoins as late as the date of Caracalla and AlexanderSevems. (Koliler, Mem. de I'Acud. tie St Petertb.vol. xiv. p. 106; Blaramberg, Choix des Med. An­tique* dOlbiopolis ou dOlbia, Paris, 1822; Mion-net, Descr. det Mid. vol. i. p. 349.) Although theinhabitants always called their city Olbia, strangerswere in the habit of calling it by the name of thechief river of Scythia, Borysthenes (BopueroVvn?,Bopoo-fltm), and the people Borystiienitae (Bo-pva&cvttTai, Herod.

P., Plin. /. c.) from its moulh, theruins of which are now found at a place on the W.bank of the Bug, called Stomogil, not far fromthe village flgiiukoje, about 12 Eng. miles belowSicholaev. This important settlement, which wassituated among the Scythian tribes of the Callipidaeand Alazones, owed its origin to the Ionic Miletusin B. c. 655. (Anon. PeripL I. c.; Euseb. Clirvn.)At an early period it became a point of the highestimportance for the inland trade, which, issuing fromthence, was carried on in an easterly and northerndirection as fax as Central Asia. It was visited byHerodotus (iv. 17, 18, 53, 78), who obtained hisvaluable information about Scythia from the Greektraders of Olbia. From the important series of in­scriptions in Bockh's collection {Inter. 2058—2096), it appears that this city, although at timesdependent upon the Scythian or Sarmatian princes,enjoyed the privileges of a free government, withinstitutions framed upon the Ionic model. Amongits eminent names occur those of Poseidonius (Suidas,r.), a sophist and historian, and Sphaeius thestoic, a disciple of Zeno of Citium. (Plut. Cleom.2.) There has been much controversy as to thedate of the famous inscription (Bijckh, No. 2058) H II 4

D.] SATUTiNIA (SaTo^'i'ia: Satumia), an ancientcity of' Ktruria, situated in the valley of the Albiuia(Albet/na), about 24 miles from its month. Thereis no doubt that it way an ancient Etruscan city;and as Pliny tells us that it was previously calledAurinia (iii. 5. s. 8), it is probable that tins wasits Etruscan name, and that it first received that ofSatumia at the time of the Roman colony. But nomention of it is found in history during the periodof Etruscan iiuic]>ondcnce; and there is certainly noground for the supposition of Miiiler that it was oneof the twelve cities of the Etruscan League. (Miii­ler, Ptrwb-r, vol. i. p. 350.) Dionysius indeedmentions it as one of the cities founded by the Pe-lasgians, and subsequently taken from them by theTyrrhenians and Etruscans (l)ionys. i. 20); butthough this is strong evidence for the antiquity ofthe city, there- is no proof that it was ever a plat e ofimportance under the Etruscans; and it even seemsprobable that before the close of their rule, Satumiahail sunk into the condition of a subordinate town,and a mere dependency of Caletra. At least it isremarkable that Livy, in speaking of the establish­ment of the Roman colony there, says that it wassettled "in agio Caletrano." (Liv. xxxix. 55.)The foundation of ihis colony, which was establishedin B.C. 183, is the only historical fact recorded tous concerning Satumia; it was a " colonia civium,"and therefore would naturally retain its colonialrank even at a late period. Pliny, however, callsit only an ordinary municipal town, but Ptolemygives it the rank of a colony, and it is mentioned assuch in an inscription of Imperial times. (Plin. iii.5. s. 8; Pud. iii. 1. § 49; Gruter. Inscr. p. 1093.8.) It is probable therefore that it received a freshcolony under the Roman Empire, though we haveno account of the circumstance. But it seems riotto have been a place of any importance, and the ex­isting remains which belong to this period are oflittle interest. The modern town of Satumia, which retains theancient site as well as name, is but a very poorplace; but its mediaeval walls are based on those ofthe ancient city, and the circuit of the latter mayhe distinctly traced. It occupied the summit of aconical hill, surrounded by steep cliffs, about 2 milesin circuit. Considerable portions of the walls re­main in several places: these are constructed ofpolygonal masonry, resembling that of Cosa, butbuilt uf travertino; they are supposed by Micali tobelong to the Roman colony, though other writerswould assign them to the Pelasgians, the earliestinhabitants of Satumia. (Micali, Ant. Pop, Hal.vol. i. pp. 152, 210; Dennis. Etruria, vol. ii. pp.308—310.) Numerous tombs are also found inthe neighbourhood of the town, but which more re­semble lbe cromlechs of northern Europe than themore regular sepulchres of other Etruscan cities.(Dennis. I. c. pp. 314—316.) [K. H.

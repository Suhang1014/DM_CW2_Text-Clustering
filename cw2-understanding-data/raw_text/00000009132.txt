Therecan be no doubt that it is represented by the modernSaurashtrdn, for a long time the seat of a powerfulnation. Surashtra means in Sanscrit u the beautifulkingdom." Ptolemy (I. c.) mentions a small villageSyraatra, which may have once been its capital. Itis probable that the Syrieni of Pliny (vi. 20. s. 23)were inhabitants of the same district. [V*.] SYKGIS (Sipyis, Herod, iv. 123), a consider­able river of European Sarmatia, which flowed fromthe country of the Thyssagetae through the terri­tory of the Maeotuc, and discharged itself into thePalus Maeotis. Modern geographers, have variouslyattempted to identify it. Keuncll (Geogr. of JJerod.p. 90) considers it to be one of the tributaries of theWolga. Gatterer (Comment. Soc. Gott. xiv. p. 36)takes it to be the Donetz, whilst Reichard identitiesit with the Jrgitz, and Linder (Scythien, p. 66)with the Don itself. [T. H.

Name.—The name Aram (D^S), more com­prehensive than the limits of Syria Proper, extends,with hevpral qualifying adjuncts, over Mesopotamiaand Chaldaea. Thus we read (1.) of Aram of thetwo rivers, or Aram Naharaim (D^lII DTt?, LXX.tt)c MetroTorafilav, Gen. xxiv. 10), equivalent toPailan-Aram, or the Plain of AramLXX.

Aram Beth-Rehob (3irrrjva d^. lxx 'Poii«, 2 Sam. x. 6,8). (5.) Aram Maacih (H^JJO, LXX. MoaXa, 1Chron. xix. 6). Of these fivo districts thus dis­tinguished, the first has no connection with thisarticle. With regard to the second, fourth, and fifth,it is doubtful whether Sobah and Rehob were in Meso­potamia or in Syria Proper. Gesenius supposes theempire of Sobah to have been situated north-cast ofDamascus ; but places the town, which he identifieswith Ncsebin, Nisibis, and Antiochia Mygdoniae,in Mesopotamia (Lex. s. m. D^K and l,uta comparison of 2 Sam. x. 6 with 1 Chron. xix. 6seems rather to imply that Rehob was in Meso­potamia, Soba and Moacha in Syria Proper; for, in

It frequently hap-~~ pens page after page, and sometimes chapter after chapter,succeed each other, in which the Greek empire is either en­tirely unnoticed, or mentioned only in a secondary or veryinferior degree of importance. I am far from denying that some advantages arise fromthe method which Mr. Gibbon has adopted. He has pointedout several which are entitled to consideration; but whateveropinion may be formed as to the comparative merit of thetwo systems, in the larger works of our author, I think,there can be no doubt as to the preference which will begiven to an uninterrupted narrative in a history which is somuch contracted. The remainder of this publication willtherefore be conducted on the same plan as the former partof it. The history of the Eastern branch of the Roman empirewill be continued without interruption; and, under thereign of each prince, the reader will find the relation of allthe events of importance which took place during that period.But although the order in which the historical events arerelated is here made to correspond with the time of theiroccurrence, the language of the history continues, with a fewexceptions, to be that of the original author. The readerwill still, in the far greater part, peruse the pages of Mr.Gibbon; but he will read them according to the order oftime in which the events occurred, instead of the trans­position which the author thought it expedient to adopt inthe ninth and tenth volumes of his history. The Editor.

Itis true, that princess had engaged his af足fections ; but the business of his heart neverinterfered with the duties of his station.Youth being the season of pleasure, Titusgave a loose to those desires, which heafterwards so well knew how to regulate.In his own reign he was remarkable forthat self-control, which he never prac足tised under his father. He set sail fromCorinth, and after steering along the coastof Achaia and Asia, which lay to the left,he directed his course towards Rhodes andCyprus. From those islands he went, bya more bold navigation (6), across the Opensea to the coast of Syria. At Cyprus cu足riosity led him to visit the temple of thePaphian Venus, famous for the worshippaid by the inhabitants, and the confluxof strangers who resorted thither from allparts. If we take this opportunity to tracethe origin of that singular worship (c), andto describe the situation of the temple,and the form of the Goddess, differing en足tirely from what is seen in any other place,the digression will, perhaps, be neithertedious, nor unacceptable to the reader.

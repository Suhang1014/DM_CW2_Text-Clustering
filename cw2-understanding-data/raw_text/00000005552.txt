As a great part, however,of the forces which Agamemnon led against Troy, wan­dered during their voyage from their destined course, andwere shipwrecked about Mysia, it happened that Ther-sander, who in valour surpassed most of the Greeks in that, war, was slain by Telephus. But the sepulchre of Ther­sander is in the plains of Caicus* in the city Ehea. This-sepulchre is of stone, and is in that«part of the forumwhich is in the open air; in which placej as they fay, theinhabitants perform funeral sacrifices in honour of him.After the death of Thersander, a second fleet being fittedout against Paris and the Trojans, the command of it wasgiven to Peneleus: for Tisamenus the son of Thersanderwas not yet old enough for this purpose. But Peneleusbeing slain by Eurypylus the son of Telephus, they choseTisamenus for their king, who was the son of Thersanderand Demonassa the daughter of Amphiaraus. This ThVmenus was free from the imprecations of Laiusand Oedi-*pus; but Autesion the son of Tisamenus did not escapethem, but was compelled on this account, in compliancewith an oracle, to migrate to the Dorienscs. After thedeparture of Autesion, Damafichthon, the grandson ofPeneleus the son of Opheltes^ was chosen king. Ptolemywas the son of this Damafichthon, and Xanthus of Pto-;lemy, I mean that Xanthus whom Andropompus slew ina single combat, by stratagem, and not in a lawful man­ner. Afterwards it appeared better to the Thebans tobe governed by many, and not to commit the administra^tion of affairs to one man alone. CHAP.

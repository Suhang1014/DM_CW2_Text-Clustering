[Mkgaka.] K1SAEI CAM PI, plains of considerable extentin the mountain district of Media, which were famousfor the production of a celebrated breed of horses.According to Strabo, they were on the road of thosewho travelled from Persisand Babylon in the direc­tion of the Caspian Gates (xi. p. 529), and fed50.000 brood inarcs for the royal stables, in anotherpla< e, the same geographer states, that the Nisaeanh'U-se were reared in the plains of Armenia (xi. p.53U), from which we inter that the plains them­selves extended from Armenia southward throughMedia. Again, in the Epitome of Strabo (iii. p.536, ed. Kramer), the NUaean plain is stated to benear the Caspian Gates, which lead into Parthia.Tiie fact is, tlie district was not accurately defined.Herodotus states that the place, from which the be>twhile hoi>es (which were reserved for the use of theking) came, was a great plain in Media (vii. 40).And the same view is taken by Eustatlnus in IdsCommentary on Dionysius (v. 1017), and con­firmed by the notice in Arriao's account of Alex­ander's march (\ii. 13). Ainmianus, on the otherhand, states that the Nisaean hordes were reared inthe plains S. of M. Coronus (now Dtmawend). Itappears to have been the custom on the most solemnoccasions to sacrifice these horses to the sun (Phi-lost r. Yit. A poll. i. 20); and it may be inferredfrom Herodotus that they were also used to drawthe chariot of the Sun (vii. 40.) (Cf. alsoSteph. \\. s. v.; Syncs. Eput. 40; Themist. Oral.v. ]>. 72; Hcliodor. Aethtop. ix. p. 437; Suid.s. V. Niiramf.) Colonel Kawlinson has examinedthe whole of this geographical question, which ismuch perplexed by the ignorance of the ancientwriters, with Ins usual ability; and has concludedthat the statements of Strabo are, on the whole,the most trustworthy, while they are, in a greatdegree, borne out by the existing character of thecountry. He states that in the rich and ex­tensive plains of Atishtar and Khawah lie recog­nises the Nisaean plains, which were visited byAlexander on his way from Baghistane to Susa andKebatana; and he thinks that the Nisaean horsecame originally from the Nisaea of Khurasan, whichis still famous for its Turkoman horses. Colonelliawiinsun further believes that Herodotus, who wasimperfectly acquainted with Median geography,traiiiderred the name Nisaea from Khorasan tof Media, and hence was the cause of much of the con­fusion which has arisen. Strabo, on the other hand,describes correctly the great horse pastures as ex­tending along the whole line of Media, from the roadwhich led from Babylon to the Caspian Gates tothat conducting from Babylon into Persia. The whole of this long district, under the names of Kia-teak, Alishtar, Huru, Sihrkhur, Bvthurud, Jips*Idle, and Feridiin, is still famous for it* exerllwtgrazing and abundance of horses. Colonel Kaffini-son, indeed, thinks that Strabo's epithet, tntfarn,is u translation of Sildkhur, which means*** failmanger.1' It was from this plain that Ptu*»brought his supply of beasts of burthen to the ease, of Antigonua (Dial, xix, 2) after the periloa* muck\ of the Greeks across the mountains of the Cosmo*.(Rawlinson, Royal Gtogr.

The late emperor had cultivated, with annual andcostly gifts, the friendship of a grateful monarch, and theenemies of Rome had respected the allies of the Avars,The same prudence would instruct the nephew of Justi­nian to imitate the liberality of his uncle, and to purchasethe blessings of peace from an invincible people, who de­lighted and excelled in the exercise of war. The replyof the emperor was delivered in the same strain of haugh­ty defiance, and he derived his confidence from the Godof the Christians, the ancient glory of Rome, and the re­cent triumphs of Justinian. "The empire (said he)abounds with men and horses, and arms sufficient to de­fend our frontiers, and to chastise the barbarians. Youoffer aid, you threaten hostilities: we despise your enmi­ty and your aid. The conquerors of the Avars solicitour alliance; shall we dread their fugitives and exiles?The bounty of our uncle was granted to your misery, toyour humble prayers. From us you shall receive a moreimportant obligation, the knowledge of your own weak­ness.

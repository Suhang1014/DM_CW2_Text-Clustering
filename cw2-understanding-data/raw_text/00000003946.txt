II. reigncr, and fat him thus up every year, and then lead himto a certain wood, and kill him, and sacrifice with their ac­customed solemnities, and taste of his entrails, and take anoath upon this sacrificing a Greek, that they would ever beat enmity with the Greeks: and that then they threw the re­maining parts of the miserable wreteh into a certain pit."Apion adds farther, — " That the man said there were but afew days to come ere he was to be slain, and implored Antio-chus that, out of the reverence he bore to the Grecian gods,he would disappoint the snares the Jews laid for his blood,and would deliver him from the miseries with which he wasencompassed." Now this is such a most tragical fable, as isfull of nothing but cruelty and impudence; yet does it notexcuse Antiochus of his sacrilegious attempts, as those whowrite it in his vindication are willing to suppose : for he couldnot presume beforehand that he should meet with any suchthing in coming to the temple, but must have found it unex­pectedly. He was, therefore, still an impious person, thatwas given to unlawful pleasures, and had no regard to Godin his actions. But [as for Apion] he hath done whateverhis extravagant love of lying hath dictated to him, as it ismost easy to discover by a consideration of his writings; forthe difference of our laws is known not to regard the Greciansonly, but they are principally opposite to the Egyptians, andto some other nations also: for while it so falls out, that menof all countries come sometimes and sojourn among us, howcomes it about that we take an oath, and conspire only againstthe Grecians ? and that by the effusion of their blood also ?Or how is it possible that all the Jews should get together tothese sacrifices, and the entrails of one man should be suffi­cient for so many thousands to taste of them, as Apion pre­tends ? Or why did not the king carry this man, whosoeverhe was, and whatsoever was his name (which is not set downin Apion's book,) with great pomp back into his own country ?when he might thereby have been esteemed a religious personhimself, and a mighty lover of the Greeks, and might therebyhave procured himself great assistance from all men againstthat hatred the Jews bore to him. But I leave this matter;

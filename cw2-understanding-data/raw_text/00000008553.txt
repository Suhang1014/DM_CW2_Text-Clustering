OCR Output NEAPOLIS. 413 NEBKODES MONS. the name of tlie city written among its branches.(Eckhel. Tol. iii. pp. 433—435: see Geuizim, Vol. I.p. 992. a.) [G. W.] 2. A town of Colchis, sonth of Dioscurias, andnorth of Phasis, on the river Chobos or Chorsos.(ScyL p. 27; Ptol. v. 10. § 2.) 3. A town on the coast of Ionia, south of Ephcsus,on the road between Anaea and Marathesium. Itwis a small place which at first belonged to theEphe*ians, and afterwards to the Samians, whoreceived it in exchange for Marathesium. (Strab.xiv. p. 639.) Most writers identify its sito with thenmdern Scala Nora, at a distance of about threehours' walk from the site of ancient Kphesus; bntCol. Leake (Asia Minor, p. 261) believes that thisplace marks the site of the ancient Marathesium, andthat the ancient remains found about halfwaybetween Scala Nora and Tshangli, belong to theancient town of Neapolis. (Comp. Toumcfort, Let­ters, xx. p. 402: Fellows, Journal of an Exc. in As.J/in, p. 271, who identifies Neapolis with Tshanglior Changli itself.) 4. A town in Caria, between Orthosis and Aphro-disias, at the foot of Mount Cadmus, in the neigh­bourhood of Hsrpasa. (Ptol. v. 2. § 19; Hicrocl.p. 688.) Kichter (Wallfahrten, p. 539) identifiesit with the modern Jenibola, near Arpas KaUssi, theancient Harpasa. Another town of the same namei.- mentioned on the coast of Caria by Mela (i. 16)and Pliny (v. 29); and it is clear that this cannot bethe same town as that near Uarpas ; it is probablyonly another name for New Myndus [Mtndcs]. 5. A town in Pisidia, a few miles south ofAntioch. (Ptol. v. 4. § 11; Hierocl. p. 672.) Pliny(v. 42) mentions it as a town of the Roman provinceof Galatia, which embraced a portion of Pisidia.Franz (Finf Inschrifttn, p. 35) identifies its sitewith Tutinet, where some ancient remains stillexi»t. [L. S.] 6. A small place situated on the Euphrates,at the distance of 14 scboeni (about 40 miles)Ki"W Be*echana. Kitter has tried, but unsuccess­fully (if the present numbers be correct) to identifyit »ith Maida. (Isid. Ham. 1'arth. i. 12, ed. Miiller,1855.) [V.] NEAPOLIS. III. In Africa. 1. In Egypt.[Caesej-ous.] 2. A town of Oyrenaica, which Ptolemy (iv. 4. §11) places in 31° ltf lat and 49° long. 'The townof Mabny or Mubly, with which it has been identi­fied, and which appears to be a corruption of theeld name, with no other change than what might beexpected from the Arab pronunciation, does notquite agree with the position assigned by Ptolemyto Nmpoli*. (Beechey, Exped. to the N. Coast ofAfrica, p. 350; Barth, Wandenmgen, pp. 391. 405.) 3. [Lcrm Magna.] 4. A town of Zcugitana with a harbour (Scylax,p. 47; Shuiiasm. (j 107 ), the same as the Maco-XADE8 of Pliny (v. 3; Moxo>aSa, Ptol. iv. 3. § 11);a * manicipium,n as it appears from the AntonineItinerary (•' Macomades Minores," Pent. Tab.; Geog.Kav. in. 5); this latter name indicates a Phoeniciancru'in. (Movers, Photnu. Alterth. vol. ii. p. 494.)It has been identified wilh Kasir Ounga, on theN. of the Gulf of Ilammamet. 5. A factory of the Carthaginians upon the SinusXKAPOUTAXL'a, from which it was the i>hoitest dis­tance to Sicily — a voyage of two days and a night.(Tboc- vii. 50; Scylax, p 49; Stadiami. § 107;Strab. xvii. p. 834.) It was taken by Agathoclcs in his African campaign. (Diodor. xx. 17.) Under theearlier emperors it was a " liberum oppidum " (Plin.v. 3 ), afterwards under Hadrian a " colonia." (Ptol.iv. 3. § 8; /tin. Anton.; Peut. Tab.; Geog. Kav. v. 5.)The old name is retained in the modern Nabel. whereBarth (Wanderungen, p. 141; comp. Shaw. Trav. p.161) found some remains of antiquity. [E. B. J.]NERIS. [Gallaecia, Vol. I. p. 933, a.]NEBO. 1. (NaSao, LXX.), the mountain fromwhich the patriarch Moses was permitted to viewthe Promised Land. Its situation is thus described:— "Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, untoMount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, thatis over against Jericho" (Veut. xxxii. 49); "andMoses went up from the plains of Moab unto themountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is overagainst Jericho." We have here three names of themount, of which, however, Abarim may designatethe range or mountain region rising from the hightable-land of Moab (comp. Numbers, xxvii. 12,xxxiii. 47); while Pisgah is an appellative for a hill,—as it is rendered in our margin, wherever thename occurs in the text (Numb. xxi. 20; Deul,iii. 27, xxxiv. 1), and in several oriental versions(Lex. s. p. H3DD),—Nebo the proper name of someone particular peak. This name is regarded by M.Quatremere as of Aramaic origin, identical with thatof the celebrated Chaldean divinity (Isaiah, xlvi. 1)so frequently compounded with the names of theirmost eminent kings, &c.; and he discovers othernames of like origin in the same parts. (Memoiresur les Nabateens, p. 87.) It is placed by Eusebiuaand St. Jerome 6 miles west of Esbus (Heshbon),over against Jericho, on the road from Livias toEsbus, near to Mount Phogor [Peor]: it wasstill called by its ancient name (Onomast. s. w.Nabau. Abarim). Dr. Robinson has truly remarkedthat over against Jericho " there is no peak or pointperceptibly higher than the rest; but all is appa­rently one level line of summit, without peaks orpaps." ..." Seetzen, Burckhardt, and also Irby andMangles, have all found Mount Nebo in Jebel 'A tta-rus, a high mountain south of the Zirka Main"(Amon). This, however, is far south of the lati­tude of Jericho. (Bib. lies. vol. iii. pp. 306, 307). 2. A town of the tribe of Reuben, mentionedwith Heshbon, Elealeh, and others (Numb, xxxii.38); doubtless the site now marked by Neba in theBelka, south of Es-Salt (Robinson, Bib. lies. vol.ii. p. 307, n. 1, vol. iii. appendix, p. 170), \. e. inthe same district with Htsban and El-'Al, themodem representatives of Heshbon and Elealeh.Whether this town was connected with the synony­mous mountain is very uncertain. 3. A town in Judah. (Ezra, ii. 29; Nehem. vii.33.) [G. W.] NEBRISSA. [Narrissa.] NEBRODES MONS (to Nfvpti&v tan, Strab.:Monti di Madonia), one of the most considerableranges of mountains in Sicily. The name wasevidently applied to a part of the range which com­mences near Capo Pelorus, and extends along thonorthern side of the island, the whole way to theneighbourhood of Panormus. Though broken intovarious mountain groups, there is no real interrup­tion in the chain throughout this extent, and thenames applied to different parts of it seem to havebeen employed (as usual in such cases) wilh muchvagueness. The part of the chain nearest to CapoIMonis, was called Mons Neptunius, and therefore'the Mons Nebrodes must have been further to the

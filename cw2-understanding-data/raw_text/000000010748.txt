This young nobleman, when he understood that theprincipal of the Roman nobility, and among the resthis own brother, had been butchered by his uncle, heresolved that nothing should appear in his spirit to alarmthe fears, and nothing in his fortune to tempt the rapa­city of the king; imagining he would be safer under thecloak of contempt, than in the protection of the laws.Wherefore, designedly assuming the air and habits of afool, he suffered himself and all his fortune to fall intothe hands of the king, and very cheerfully took the sir-name of Brutus; that his extraordinary abilities, con­cealed under this title of reproach, might watt for theproper season to appear with redoubled lustre, in assert­ing the liberty of Rome. When at that time he accompanied the Tarqnins toDelphi, rather as their buffoon, than companion, it is'reported of him, that he carried with him a rod of gold,enclosed in a case of elder, which gave it the appearanceof a common stick, as a present to Apollo.—This was atrue emblem of his own mind and external appearance. When they had finished their journey, and executedtheir father's commands, they were prompted by theircuriosity to enquire of the oracle, which of them shouldsucceed him in the kingdom. Upon which, it is said,a voice from the bottom of the cave made the followingresponse: " Whoever of you, gentlemen, shall first"have the good fortune to give a kiss to his mother,"shall be ruler at Rome." The Tarquins, as Sextustheir brother had been left at Rome, and consequentlyignorant of the oracle's answer, that he should have noshare in the government, order that all should be keptsecret and determined by lot, which of them two, upontheir return to Rome, should first kiss his mother Tullia.But Brutus concluding that the oracle's mean:ng wasvery different, pretended to fall down by chance, andkissed the earth, the common mother of all living. Af­ter this they all returned to Rome, where they foundthe city in a commotion, on account of the preparationsfor a.war against the Rutuli.

From this fact, and from similar examples,there is reason to believe, that the constitution of thelegionary troops, to which they partly owed theirvalour and discipline, was dissolved by Constantine;and that the bands of Roman infantry, which stillassumed the same names and the same honours, con­sisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men.The conspiracy of so many separate detachments,each of which was awed by the sense of its own weak­ness, could easily be checked; and the successors ofConstantine might indulge their love of ostentation,by issuing their orders to one hundred and thirty-twolegions, inscribed on the muster-roll of their nu­merous armies. The remainder of their troops wasdistributed into several hundred cohorts of infantry,and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms, and titles,and ensigns, were calculated to inspire terror, and todisplay the variety of nations who marched under theImperial standard. And not a vestige was left ofthat severe simplicity, which, in the ages of freedomand victory, had distinguished the line of battle of aRoman anny from the confused host of an Asiaticmonarch. A more particular enumeration, drawnfrom the Notitia, might exercise the diligence of anantiquary; but the historian will content himselfwith observing, that the number of permanent sta­tions or garrisons established on the frontiers of theempire amounted to five hundred and eighty-three;and that, under the successors of Constantine, thecomplete force of the military establishment was com­puted at six hundred and forty-five thousand sol­diers*. An effort so prodigious surpassed the wantsof a more ancient, and the faculties of a later,period. * Agathias, 1 . y. p. lbj. edit. Louvre.

The authors of this project were Thaeanetus,the son of Timedes, a soothsayer, and F.umolpidas, the son ofDaimachus, who was one of their commanders. But after­wards, half of the number, affrighted by the greatness of thedanger, refused to have a share in the attempt. Yet the re­mainder, to the number of about two hundred and twenty,resolutely adhered to attempt an escape in the following man­ner They made ladders equal in height to the enemy's wall.The measure of this they learned from the rows of brick,where the side of the wall facing them was not covered overwith plaster. Several persons were appointed to count therows at the same time; some of them might probably bewrong, but the greater part would agree in the just compu­tation ; especially, as they counted them several times over,and were besides at no great distance, since the part markedout for the design was plainly within their view. In this me­thod, having guessed the measure of a brick from its thick­ness, they found out what must be the total height for theladders. The work of the Peloponnesians was of the followingstructure.—It was composed of two circular walls ; one to­wards Plateea, and the other outward, to prevent any attackfrom Athens. These walls were at the distance of sixteenfeet one from the other ; and this intermediate space of six­teen feet was built into distinct lodgments for the guards.These however, standing thick together, gave to the wholework the appearance of one thick entire wall, with battle­ments on both sides. At every ten battlements were loftyturrets of the same breadth with the whole work, reachingfrom the face of the inward wall to that of the outward; sothat there was no passage by the sides of a turret, but thecommunication lay open through the middle of them all.By night, when the weather was rainy, they quitted the

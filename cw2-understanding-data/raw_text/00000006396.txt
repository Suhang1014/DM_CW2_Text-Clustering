OCR Output GENEALOGICAL TABLE. 347 among the gods. His deification wastreated with contempt and ridicule by Se­neca, in a tract still extant, entitled, Clau-dii Casari Apocololcintosis. The generaldesign of the piece is not ill imagined; butthe humour is often coarse, and, upon thewhole, inferior to what might have beenexpected from the lively genius of that en­tertaining writer. Claudius, with all theappearance of inert faculties and an im­passive mind, devoted his time, in reposeand indolence, to literature and the politearts. He was not entirely void of taste.His compositions in Greek, as well as La­tin, were written with purity and even ele­gance. Two pieces of a brass table havebeen found at Lyons, on which is engrav­ed a speech of Claudius, in characters soplainly legible, that Dotteville (in his edi­tion of Tacitus) has given an exact copy,-faithfully compared with the original (seeat the end of his Notes to Annals, bookxii.).—Suet.

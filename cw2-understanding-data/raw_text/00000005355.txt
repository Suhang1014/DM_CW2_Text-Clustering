The wife benevo­lence of Ormusd formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly pro­vided his fair habitation with the materials of happiness. By hisvigilant providence, the motion of the planets, the order of theseasons, and the temperate mixture of the elements are preserved.But the malice of Ahriman has long since pierced Ormusd's egg-tor, in other words, has violated the harmony of his works. Sincethat fatal irruption, the most minute particles of good and evilare intimately intermingled and agitated together; the rankestpoisons spring up amidst the most salutary plants; deluges, earth­quakes, and conflagrations, attest the conflict of Nature, and thelittle world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and misfortune;Whilst the rest of human kind are led away captives in the chainsof their infernal enemy, the faithful Persian alone, reserves hisreligious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and sightsunder his banner of light, in the full confidence, that he shall, inthe last day, mare the glory of his triumph.

The tops of the"highest mountains are the places chosen for sacrifices. Hymns'* and prayers are the principal worship; the Supreme God who'* fills the wide circle of Heaven^ is the object to whom they are6 "addressed."

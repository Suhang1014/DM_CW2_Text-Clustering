VcHpiSiot), a city in theNW. extremity of Arcadia, bounded on the N. byArcadia, and on the W. by Elis. It was a veryancient place. It is said to have been originallycalled Erymanthus, and its territory to have beenravaged by the Erymanthian boar. (Pans. viii. 24.§ 2; Hecat. ap. Sleph. B. s. v. Yimpli; Apollod. ii.5. § 4.) It afterwards received the name of Phegia orPhegeia (4>tj7!o, 4>r^ytio), apparently from the oaks(<p7ryo!), which are still found upon the site of thetown; though the ancients, as usual, derived thename from an eponymous founder, Phegeus. (Steph.B. «. rt>. *7(7fia, Vuxpls; Paus. /. c.) It was calledPsophis by Echcphron and Promachus, Bons of Her­cules, who are said to have come from Sicily andgiven to the town this name after their motherPsophis. (Paus. /. c.) Psophis, while still calledPhegia, was celebrated as the residence of Alcmaeon,who fled thither from Argos, after slaying his mother,and married Alphesiboea, the daughter of Phegeus.(Paus. viii. 24. § 8; Diet, of Bioijr. s. v. Alcmaeon.)In consequence of their connection with Alcmaeon,the Psophidii took part in the second expeditionagainst Thebes, and refused to join the other Greeksin the Trojan War. (Paus. viii. 24. § 10.) P.-ophis is rarely mentioned in history. In B. c.219 it was in possession of the Eleians, and wastaken by Philip, king of Macedonia, who was thenin alliance with the Achaeans. In narrating thisevent Polybius gives an accurate description of thetown. "Psophis," he says,u is confessedly an ancientfoundation of the Arcadians in the district Azanis.It is situated in the central parts of Peloponnesus,but in the western corner of Arcadia, and adjoiningthe Achaeans dwelling furthest towards the west.It also overhangs conveniently the country of theKleians, with whom the city was then in closealliance. Philip marched thither in three days fromCaphyae, and encamped upon the hills opposite tothe city, where he could safely have a view of thewhole city and the surrounding places.

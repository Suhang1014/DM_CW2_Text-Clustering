Na^os: Capodl SrAiV»), an ancient city of Sicily, on the K. coastof the island between Catana and Messana. It was(situated on a low point of laud at the mouth of theriver Aeesines (Alcantara), and at the foot of thehill on which was afterwards built the city of Tau-romenium. All ancient writers agree in represent­ing Naxos as the most ancient of all the Greekcolonies in Sicily; it was founded the year beforeSyracuse, or B.C. 735, by a body of colonists fromChalcis in Euhoea, with whom there was mingled,according to Ephorus, a certain number of [on'ians.The same writer represented Theories, or Thucles,the leader of the colony and founder of the city, asan Athenian by birth; but Thucydides takes nonotice of this, and describes the city as a purelyChalcidic colony; and it seems certain that in Intertimes it was generally so regarded. (Time. vi. 3;Ephor. ap. Strab. vi. p. 267; Scymn. Ch. 270—277;Diod. xiv. 88. Concerning the date of its found- atian see Clinton, F. //. vol. i. p. 164; Enseb. CVwr»d 01. II. 1.) The memory of Xaxns as tb* «r-liest of all the Greek settlements in Sicily J***served by the dedication of an altar outside \Utown to Apollo Arehegetes. the divine patron awaswhose authority the colony had sailed; and it «uicustom (still retained long after the de^tnu-.i'i <iNaxos itself) that all Theori or envoys prcervh]on sacred missions to Greece, or returning h*athence to Sicily, should offer sacrifice on lata x.'is(Thuc. /. c.; Appian, B. C. v. 109.) It is liotiithat none of the writers above cited aiiud? !<■ tiorigin of the name oi X;ix»s; but there can he bnldoubt that this was derived, as stated by Heii*oirt(ap. St'ph. li. it. r. XaA*n), from the yr****among the original settlers of a body of ctiiito'from the island of that name. The new colony must have b**en Bpeedih j .-■by fresh settlers from Greece, as within miafter its first otablishment the Chakidians *lwere able to send out a fresh colony, which focn4the city of Leontini, B.C. 730; and this was sp«*Jifollowed by that of Catana. Theocles hin^K 1came the Oekist, or reco^ni>ed founder, of the formand Euarchus, probably a Chalcidic citizen, cf tlatter. (Thuc. /. c; Scymn, Ch. 2 83—2*6: N*vi. p. 268.) Strabo and S-ymnus Chios tfcsb re?sent Zancle also as a colony from Najt:«?, but n» tision to this is found in Thucydides. But. as it icertainly a C ha Iridic colony, it is probable that asettlers from Naxos joined tho>c fn^m the pi'country. (Strab. vi. p. 26S; Scymn. Ch. 286. Ti vi. 4.) Callipolis also, a city of uncertain st>,which ceased to exist at an early period, was •lony of Naxos. (Strab. vi. p. 272; S-cvmn. Ch. LBut notwithstanding these evidences of i;s eariT:sperity, we have very little information as laearly history of Naxos; and the tirst facts trmitted to us concerning it relate to ili^siers *Msustained. Thus Her»nlotus tells us that it «as >j«the cities which was besieged and taicen H:crates.despot of Gela. about u.c. 4ys—(iii vii. 154); and his expressions would lead us u»that it was reduced In him under f*rm»f Ajection. It ajipears to have afterwards so-r»-«dpassed under the authority of Gel^n of and his brother Hieron, as we find it sub^X Xlatter in n.c. 476. At that time Hieroo. witn ato strengthen his own power, removed the ink***of Naxos at the same time with those of CaV-ivjsettled them together at Leontini. while he n*:*the two cities with fresh colonists fr^m ath-rters (Diod. xi. 49).

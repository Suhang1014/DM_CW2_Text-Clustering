[Ostia.] PORTUS VENERIS {Port Vendre), on thesouth coast of France near the borders of Spain.The passage about Portus Veneris in Mela (ii. 5)is thus (ed. Is. Vossius): "T urn inter Pyrenaeipromuntoria Portus Veneris insignis fano." Thewords "insignis fano" are a correction of Vossiuswithout any authority, which lie has substituted forthe words of the liest SIS., " in sinu salso." PortVendre is in France, near Coliioure, a few milessouth of the mouth of the 7>cA. Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 2) fixes the boundary of Nar-honensis at the promontory on which stood theAphrodisium or temple of Venus. Pliny (iii. 3)in his description of Hi*pania Citerior, after men­tioning Em]»riae (Ampurvu). says: "KlumenTichis. Ab co Pyrenaea Venus in latere promontoriialtero xL M." This river Tichis is the river whichis near the site of Emporiac (Ampuriai) in Spain.D'Anville concludes that the promontorium of Plinyis the Promontorium Pyrenaeum of the Table, themodern Cop Creux, which projects into the Medi­terranean. This would be a fit place for the temple,for it was an ancient practice to build temples onbold headlands. But Pliny says "on the other,"that is on the Gallic side of the promontorium:and the distance of zl. M. P. from the river ofAmpuria» brings us to the position of Port Vendre.Accordingly D'Anville concludes that the temple ofVenus was near the port of Venus; and this wouldseem likely enough. This temple is apparentlymentioned by Stephanus (*. v. *Atppo9totds); andcertainly by Strabo (iv. p. 178), who makes the coastof the Narbonensis extend from the Var to thotemple of the Pyrenaean Venus, the boundary betweenNarbonensis and Iberia; but others, he adds, makethe Tropaea Pompeii the boundary of Iberia andCeltica. The Tropaea Pompeii were in a pass ofthe Pyrenees not far from the coast. In thispassage Strabo simply says that the temple of thePyrenaean Venus was fixed as the boundary ofGallia and Hispania by some geographers, but thispassage does not tell us where the temple is; andthe distances which he gives in the same place(iv. p. 178) will not settle the question. Hut inanother passage (iv. p. 181) lie makes the GalaticusSinus extend from a point 100 stadia from Massiliu"to the Aphrodisium, the promontory of Pyrene."It is plain that his promontory of Pyrene is CapCreux, for this is a marked natural limit of theGallic bay on the west; and he also places thetemple there. Cap Creux is a natural boundarybetween Gallia and Hispania, and we may concludethat it was the ancient coast boundary. Wo knowthat Gen-aria, which is south of Portus Veneris and u it 3

Metcllus Celcr was imprisoned thereby the tribune L. Flaviua, Metellus Attempted toassemble the senate in it. (Dion Cass, xxxvii. 50.)Its distinctness from the Career Mamertinus is also.shown by Seneca (Qmtrov. 27, p. 303, Bipont). An important alteration in the arrangement ofthe forum, to which we have before ulluded, wasthe removal of tlie Tribunal I'raetokis fromthe comitium to the eastern end of the forumby the tribune L. Seribonius Libo, apparently init.c. 149. It now stood near the Putea], a placeso called from its being open at the top like a well,and consecrated in ancient time.> either from thewhetstone of the augur Xavius having been buriedthere, or from its having been struck by lightning.It was repaired and re-dedicated by Libo; whence itwas afterwards called IVtkai, Libonis, and Pu-tkal Scriuonianl'M. After this period, its vicinityto the judgment-seat rendered it a noted object atj£i»me, and we find it frequently alluded to in theclassics. (Hor. J-'p. i. 19. 8, Sat. ii. 0. 35 ; Cic./>. rt'TEAL LIBONIS (>K SCKIBOKIAN I'M. Sest. 8, &e.) The tribunal of the praetor urbanusteems, however, to have remained <>n the comitium.lle>ides these we also find a Tribunal A u heliumlneutiimed on the forum, which seems to have stoodnear the temple of Castor (Cic. Sest, 15, inJ'is. 5, fluent. 34), and which, it is conjectured,was erected by the consul M. Aurelius Cotta B.C.74. These tribunals were probably constructed ofwood, and in such a manner that they might beremoved on occasion, as for iiustanee, when the wholearea of the forum was required lor gladiatorial showsor oilier purposes of the like kind; at least it appearsthat the tribunals were used for the purpose ofmaking the tire in the curia when the body of Clo-dius was burnt in it. (Ascon. ad Cic. Mil. Arg.f. 34.) Iii the year B.C. 12 1 the I EMPLE ok Concord wasbuilt by the consul L. Opintius on the Clivus Capi-tolinus just above the senaculum (Varr. A. L. v.$ 1 50, Midi.); but, as we have already had occasionto discuss the history of this temple when treatingof the Capitol and of the senaculum, we need notrevert to it here. At the same time, or a littleafterwards, he also erected the Basilica Opimia,which is mentioned by Varro in c!o>e connectionwith the temple of Concord, and must thereforehave stood on its northern side, since on no otherwould there have been space for it.

THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 373 deed in their present situation: For hitherto, afraid ofthe naval strength of the Peloponnesians, because of therebusfs they had lately received from it, and the cala­mitous event of the Sicilian expedition, from this mo­ment they stopped all fruitless self-accusations or ground­less exaggerations of the enemy's ability by sea. Someships of the enemy in fact they take; for instance, eightChian, five Corinthian, two Ambraciot, two Bœotian;but, of Leucadian, and Lacedæmonian, and Syracu-san, and Pellenean, a single one of each: But then theysufsered the loss of fifteen ships of their own. After erecting a trophy upon the cape of Cynos-sema,and picking up the shatters of the fight, and giving up,under truce, their dead to the enemy, they dispatcheda trireme to Athens, to notify the victory. On the ar­rival of this vessel, those at home, after hearing thenews of this unhoped-for success, greatly resumed theirspirits, which had been dejected by the recent misfor­tunes at Eubœa and the fad efsects of their sedition,and hoped the State might again resume its power ifthey cheerfully exerted their efforts in its behalf. On the fourth day after the battle, the Athenians,having diligently resitted their fleet at Sestus, sailed a-gainst Cyzicus, which had revolted: And, descryingeight ships from Byzantium riding at anchor underHarpagium and Priapus, they crouded fail towardsthem j and, having in battle upon the shore deseatedtheir crews, made prizes of them all. Repairing thenceagainst Cyzicus, which was quite unfortified, they re­duced it once more, and exacted large contributionsfrom it. But, during this interval, the Peloponnesians madea trip from Abydus to Eleus, and brought off as manyof their own ships which had been taken as were able to, fail j the residue the Eleusians burnt. They also dis­patched Hippocrates and Epicles to Eubcea, to setchup their fleet from thence. B b 3 About

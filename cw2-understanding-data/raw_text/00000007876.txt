A mountain rangeof Mysia, extending eastward as far as tlie riverSangarius, and dividing Phrygia from Bithynia.To distinguish it from other mountains of the .samename, it often is called the Mysian Olympus. Usheight rises towards the west, and that part which isof the greatest height, is the highest mountain in allAsia Minor. The country around this mountain waswell peopled, but its heights were thickly clad withwood, and contained many safe retreats for robbers,bands; of whom, under a regular leader, often renderedthe country unsafe. (Strab. xii. p. ."i74, eomp. x.p. 470, xii. p. 571; Herod, i. 36, vii. 74; Ptol. v. 1.§ 10; Steph. B.s.v.; Plin. v. 40, 43; Pomp, Mela,i. 19; Airim. Marc. xxvi. 9, Schul. ad Apollon.Hh'td. i. 598.) The lower regions of this greatmountain are still covered with extensive forests; hutthe summit is rocky, devoid of vegetation, andduring the greater part of tiie year covered withsnow. The Turks generally call it Anadvli Dagh,though the western or highest parts also bear thename of KeshUh Dagh, that is, the Monk's Mountain,and the eastern Ttmmaivlji or Domoun Dagh. TheByzantine historians mention several fortresses todefend the passes of Olympus, such as Pitheca(Xicet. Chun. p. 35; B. Ciunam. p. 21), Acrunum,and Calogroea (B.

A mountain in the north of Galatia, which itseparates from Bithynia. It is, properly shaking,only a continuation of the My>ian Olympus, and isreaiarkable in history for the defeat sustained on itby the Tolistoboii, in a battle against the Romansunder Man 1 his. (Liv. xxxviii. 19, &c; Polyb. xxii.20. 21.) Its modern name is Ah Dagh. 3. A volcanic mountain in the east of Lycia, alittle to the north-east of Corydalla. It also borethe name of Phoenicns, and near it was a large town,likewise bearing the name Olympus. (Strab. xiv.p. 66G.) Ju another passage (xiv. p. 671) Strabospeaks of a mountain Olympus and a stronghold of thesame name in Cilicia. from which the whole of Lycia,Pamphylia, and Pisidia could be surveyed, and whichwas in his time taken possession of by the Isaurianrobber Zenicetas. It is, however, generally supposedthat this Cilician Olympus is no other than theLycian, and that the geographer was led into hismistake by the fact that a town of the name ofCoryeus existed both in Lycia and Cilicia. On theLycian Olympus stood a temple of Hephaestus.(Comp. Siivitasm. Mar. Mag. § 205; Ptol. v. 3.§ 3.) Scylax (39) does not mention Olympus, buthis Siderus is evidently no other place.

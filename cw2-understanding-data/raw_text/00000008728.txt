Thisriver itself, however, was sufficient to afford a shelterand place of anchorage for shipping in ancient times(Cicm/ Att. xvi. 7), and is still resorted to for thesame purpose by the light vessels of the country.Nn other ruins exist on the site of the ancient cityexcept some masses of buildings, which, being in thereticulated style, are unquestionably of Roman date:portions of aqueducts, reservoirs for water. &c. arealso visible. (The site and existing remains ofVelia are described by Mtinter, Velia in Luamien,8vo. Alton a, 1818, pp. 15—20, and by the Due doLuynes, in the Annali dell1 Jwttituto, 1829, pp.381—38(3.) It is certain that as a Greek colony Velia neverrose to a par with the more opulent and flunriidiingcities of Magna Gniecta. Its chief celebrity in an­cient times Wits derived front its celebrated school ofphilosophy, which was universally known as theEleatic school. Its founder Xenophnncs w:us indeeda native of Colophon, but had established himself atVelia, anil wrote a long poem, in which he celebratedthe foundation of that city. (Diog. Laert. ix. 2. §'20.) His distinguished successors Parnienides andZeno were both of them born nt Velia, and the samething is asserted by some writers of Leucippus, thefounder of the atomic theory, though others repre­sent him as a native of Ahdera or Melos. HenceDiogenes Laert ins terms Velia "an inconsiderablecity, but capable of producing great men" (ix. 5. §28). [E. H. B.] COIN OF YKLIA. VELINUS (Vtlino), a considerable river ofCentral Italy, which has its sources in the loftygroup of the Apennines between Nursia (A'orcta)and Interocrea (Antrodoco)* Its actual source isin the immediate neighbourhood of the ancientFalacrinum, the birthplace of Vespasian, where anold church still bears the name of Sta Marui diFont? Velino. The up]>er part of its course isfrom N. to S.; but near Antrodoco it turns abrupilyto the W . pursues that direction as far as Hteii,and theme Hows about NNW. till it discharges itswaters into the Nar (Xera) about 3 miles aboveTerni (Interamna). Just before reaching thatriver it forms the celebrated cascade now known asthe Falls of Tend or Cascaia delle Mar move.This waterfall is in its present form wholly arti­ficial. It was h'rst formed by M\ Curius Deutatus,who opened an artificial channel for the waters ofthe Velinus, and thus carried off a considerablepart of the Lac us Velinus, which previously occu­pied a great part of the valley below Re&te. Therestill remained, however, as there does to this day, aconsiderable lake, called the Laens Velinus, andnow known as the Lago di Pie di Lugo. It wason the banks of this lake that the villa of Axius,the friend of Cicero and Varro, was situated. (Cic.ad All. iv. 15; Varro, HR. ii. 1, 8.) Severalsmaller lakes still exist a little higher up thevalley: hence we find Pliny speaking in the plural of the Vfxixt Lacus (Plin. iii. 12. s. IT; TatAnn. i. 79; Vib. Seq. p. 24.)

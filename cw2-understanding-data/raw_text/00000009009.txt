[C. II. S.]SIORIMARUSA. [Oceanm'sSkitentiuoxalis.] iMORI'MKXE (Mopi/«wf). a district in the north­west of Cuppadocia, comprising both banks of theriver Halys, is said to have been tit only for pasture |land, to have had scarcely any fruit-trees, and to ihave abounded in wild asses. (Strab. xii. pp. 534, j537, 539, 540; Plin. //. .V. vi. 3.) The Romans |regarded it as a part of Galatia, whence Ptolemy(v. 6) does not mention it among the districts ofCappadocia. [L. S.J MO'RINI, a nation of Bclgica. Virgil is the au­thority for the quantity; —"Extremique hominum Morini." (Aen. viii. 727.) It has been shown in the article Mknapii thaton the north the Morini were hounded by the Menapii. jOn the west the ocean was the boundary, and on!the south the Ambiani and the At rebates. The ,eastern boundary cannot be so easily determined.!The element of Morini seems to be tin; word mor,the sea, which is a common Flemish word still, and:also found in the Latin, tho German, and the 1English languages. Caesar, who generally speaks of the Morini withthe Menapii, has fixed their position in general terms.!When he first invaded Britannia he went into the jcountry of the Morini, because the passage from 1there to Britain was the shortest (/>'. G. iv. 21). Inthe next expedition, B.O. 54, he sailed from Port usIt ins, having ascertained that the passage from this .port to Britain was the most commodious. Tortus |ltiusis in the country of the Morini [Itius PoRTrs]. ,Ptolemy (n. II. § 8) mentions two cities of theMorini, Gesoriacum or Bononia (^Bwhtgne1), and 1Taruenna (7*Atro«e««r), east of it. in the interior. 1If we add Castellum Morinorum (Gi**e/), in the ,interior, south of l/uttfo nptet *' we see that, besides Ithe diocese of Boulogne, the territory of the Morini ,comprises the new dioceses of St. Omer and Ypem, Iwhich sneceeiied to that of Tournau* (D'Amille.) \But if Casstl is not within the limits of the Morini,their territory will not be so extensive as D'Anvillemake-, it. [Mknatii.] Caesar's wars with the Morini were more suc­cessful than with the Menapii. A large part of theterritory of the Morini did not offer such naturalobstacles as the land of the Menapii. The marshesof the Morini would be between CalaU and Ihtn-kerune. The force whirl) the Morini were sup]xised jto be able to wnd to the Relgie confederation in'B.C. 57 was estimated at 25,000 men. Though ■most of the Morini were subdued by Cac-ar, they |ro.ve again in the lime of Augustus, and were put ,down by C. Carinas (Dion Cassias, li. 21). When IBononia was made a Roman port, and Taruenna aRoman town, the country of the Morini would becomeRomanised, and Roman usages and (he Roman lan­guage would prevail. There were Roman ruadswhich terminated at Bononia and Castellum. An inscription mentions the Ih-ccinviri of theColonia Morinorum, but it is unknown what placeit is. [G. L.] MO'RICS.

XH-V. the most learned civilians of the east, to labour withthejr sovereign in the work of reformation .b The the­ory of professors was assisted by the practice of advo­cates, and the experience of magistrates; and the wholeT"d "aSr Vn^erta^'.nff was animated by the spirit of Tribonian.0—546. This extraordinary man, the object of so much praiseand censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and hisgenius, like that of Bacon, embraced, as bis own, all thebusiness and knowledge of the age. Tribonian com­posed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity ofcurious and abstruse subjects'1—a double panegyric ofJustinian and the life of the philosopher Theodotus; thenature of happiness, and the duties of government; Ho­mer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of metre;the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of themonths; the houses of the planets; and the harmonicsystem of the world. To the literature of Greece headded the use of the Latin tongue; the Roman civilians. were deposited in his library and in his mind; and hemost assiduously cultivated those arts which opened theroad of wealth and preferment. From the bar of thepraetorian prefects, he raised himself to the honours ofquaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: thecouncil of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom,and envy was mitigated by the gentleness and affabilityof his. manners. The reproaches of impiety and avaricehave .stained the v irtues or the reputation of Tribonian. '• « ■ • * For the legal labours of Justinian, I have studied the preface to the Institutes;the first, second, and third prefaces to the Pandects; the first and second preface tothe Code; and the Code itself, (lib. 1. tit. 17. de Veteri Jure enucleando). Afterthese originat testimonies, I have consulted, among the moderns, Heineccius, (Hist.J.R. no. 383—404.) Terasson, (Hist. de la Jurisprudence Romaine, p. 295—356.)Gravina, (Opp. p'. 93—100.) and Ludewig, in hfs life of Justinian, (p. 19—123.318—321. for the Code and Novels, p. 209—261. for the Digest or Pandects, p.262—317.) ': ''. ■■<-'' c For the character of Tribonian, see the testimonies of Procopius, (Persic. lib. 1.£. 23, 24.' Anecdot. c. 13. 20.) and Suidas. (tow. 3. p. 501.'edit. Kuster.) Lude­wig (in Vit.'juttiniajt. p. 175—209.) works hard, very hard, to white-wash—tlieblack-a-moor. d I apply the two passages of Suidas to the same man; every circumstance so ex­actly tallies. Yet the lawyers appear ignorant; and Fabricibs is inclined to separatethe two characters. (Bihliot. Graec. tom. 1. p. 341. 2. p. 518. 3. p. 418. 12. p. 346. 363. 474.) ; • •

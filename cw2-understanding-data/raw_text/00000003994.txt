Moreover,the hope of plunder induced many to go on, as having thisopinion, that all the places within were full of money, and asseeing that all around about it was made of gold. And, be­sides, one of those that went into the place prevented Caesar,when he ran so hastily out to restrain the soldiers, and threwthe fire upon the hinges of the gate, in the dark; wherebythe flame burst out from within the holy house itself immedi­ately, when the commanders retired and Cnesar with them,and when nobody any longer forbade those that were withoutto set fire to it.

Nowthe number of years that passed from its first foundation,which was laid by king Solomon, till this its destruction,which happened in the second year of the reign of Vespasian,are collected to be one thousand one hundred and thirty,besides seven months and fifteen days; and from the secondbuilding of it, which was done by Haggai, in the second yearof Cyrus the king, till its destruction under Vespasian, therewere six hundred thirty-nine years and forty-five days.

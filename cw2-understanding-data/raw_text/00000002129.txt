XLIII. that the comet, "from its horrid hair, shakes pestilenceand war."™ Its road in the heavens was observed withexquisite skill by Flamstead and Cassini; and the ma­thematical science of Bernoulli, Newton, and Halley,investigated the laws of its revolutions. At the eighthperiod, in the year 2255, their calculations may perhapsbe verified by the astronomers of some future capital inthe Siberian or American wilderness.B«ft- II. The near approach of a comet may injure or de-stroy the globe which we inhabit; but the changes onits surface have been hitherto produced by the action ofvolcanos and earthquakes." The nature of the soil mayindicate the countries most exposed to these formidableconcussions, since they are caused by subterraneous fires,and such fires are kindled by the union and fermenta­tion of iron and sulphur. But their times and effectsappear to lie beyond the reach of human curiosity, andthe philosopher will discreetly abstain from the predic­tion of earthquakes, till he has counted the drops of wa­ter that silently filtrate on the inflammable mineral, andmeasured the caverns which increase by resistance theexplosion of the imprisoned air. Without assigning thecause, history will distinguish the periods in which thesecalamitous events have been rare or frequent, and willobserve that this fever of the earth raged with uncom­mon violence during the reign of Justinian."

The fire of youth, the temper of the middle-aged, and" the experience of the old should ever duly accord and actM together. Sloth ruins a community; practice enables it44 to go through every conflict, and to triumph over all oppo-" sition." Such an address could not but affect, such argumentscould not but be persuasive with the people of Athens : Theexpedition must go forwards. But Nicias makes a secondeffort, if possible, to divert them from it. He begins with " a prayer for its success ; and a desire," that the preparations may be adequate to the ends pro-44 posed. He states the nature, the power, and strength of" the people they are going to invade. He then, in gene-" ral terms, gives in a bulky roll of necessary articles for" those who invade them. He hopes to frighten and deter44 his audience by the vast expence, which he shews must" necessarily be incurred on this occasion. The Athenians44 must provide every thing themselves, and trust for nothing" to the care and fidelity of Sicilian allies. The public wel-44 fare, and the safety of all, who are to be employed in this44 expedition, demand all manner of previous foresight and" care." This speech had a different effect to what Nicias designed.Instead of discouraging, it animated his countrymen morethan ever for execution. Accordingly, a decree was soonpassed, investing himself and his colleagues, who were Alci-biades and Lamachus, with full power to provide every thingneedful for the service. All hands now were soon at work. The quotas from thedependents were demanded; the fleet was equipped andmanned ; the levies went on briskly, since all men came intothe service with alacrity ; and every thing was soon ready forthe expedition.

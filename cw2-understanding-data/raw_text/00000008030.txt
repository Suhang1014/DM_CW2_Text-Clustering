Its exactposition cannot be made out, though it mtbt havebeen near Kurdistan. (Kitter, Ertlbumit, vol. x.p. 816.) [K. B.J.] MUCHIRE'SIS (Movxtlmatf al. MouxiifMtrii,Procop. B. G. iv. 2,15, 16), a Clinton of Lazicu, po­pulous and fertile: the vine, which does not growin the rest of Colchis, was found here. It waswatered by the river Kheon ('PeW). Archaeopolis,its chief town, was the capital of Colchis, and aplace of considerable importance in the Lazic war.(Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. ix. p. 217; Gibbon,c. xlii.) [K. B. J.] MUCKAE or NUCRAE (the reading is uncertain),a town of Samuium, mentioned only by Silius Italicus(viii. 566), the situation of which is whollv un­known. [E. H. B.] MUCUXI. [Maibktaisia.] MUDUTTI. [Modutti.] ML'GILI.A, an ancient city of Latium, mentionedonly by Dionysius (viii. 36), who enumerates theMugillani (MoyiKaivovs) among the places conqueredby Coriolanus, at the head of the Vol.scian army.He tlicre mentions them (as well as the Albietes. whoare equally unknown) between the citizens of Polluscuanil C'oriuli, and it is therefore probable that Mu-gilla lay in the neighbourhood of those cities; but wehave no further clue to its site. The name does notagain appear, even in Pliny's list of the extinct citiesof Latium; and we should be apt to suspect somemistake, but that the cognomen of Mugillanus,borne by one family of the Papirian Gens, seems toconfirm the correctness of the name. [E. H. B.] MUICU'RUM (MouJXoDpoi'), a place on the coastof Illyricum, near Saluna, which was taken for Tolila,kin£ of the Goths, by Ilauf. (l'rocop. B. G. iii. 35;Le Bean. Bits Empire, vol. ix. p. 82.) [E. B. J.] MULEI.ACHA, a town upon a promontory ofthe same name on the W. coast of Africa (Polyb.ap. Plin. v. 1), now Mul-y Bu Stlhtim, the oldMamura of the charts. (Oomp. London Geog. Juurn.vol. vi. p. 302.) [E. B. J.] MUIXCHA, a river of Mauritania, which Sal lust{Jug. <J2,110), Mela (i. 5. §§ 1,5), and Pliny (v. 2)assign as the boundary between the Mauri and Mas-laesyli, or the subjects of Bocchus and Jugurtha.As Stmbo (xvii. pp. 827,829) makes the Miiui-oath (MoAox<f0, MoAox<W, Ptol. iv. 1. §7) servethe same purpo>e, there can be no doubt that theyare one anil the same river. The M.vr.VA (MoAoi/a,Ptol. I. c.) of l'liny (/. c), or the Mulmri, whichforms the frontier between Morocco and Algeria, isthe same as the river which bounded the Moors fromthe Numidians. This river, rising at or near theS. extremity of the lower chain of Atlas, and flow­ing through a diversified country, as yet almostuntrodilcn by Europeans, falls into the sea nearly inthe middle of the Gulf of ildilah of our charts.(Shaw, Trav. pp. 10—16.) [E. B. J.] MUNDA (Mouvta). 1. An important town ofIlispania Baetica, and a Roman colony belonging tothe conventus of A-itigi. (Strab. iii. p. 141; Plin.iii. 1. ».;).) Strabo (I.e.) says that it is 1400stadia from Carteia. It was celebrated on accountof two battles fought in its vicinity, the first inB.C. 216. when Cn. Scipio defeated the Cartha­ginians (I.iv. xxiv. 42; Ml. Ital. iii. 4011), and thesecond in B. c. 45, when Julius Caesar gained avictory over the sons of Pompey. (Diou Cass. xliii. 39; Auct. Belt. Hisp. 30, seq.; Strab. iii.pp. 141, 160; Klor. iv. 2; VaL Max. vii. 6.) Itwas taken by one of Caesar's generals, and, acuordincto Pliny, from that time it ceased to exist. (" FnitMunda cum Pompei filio rapta," Plin. iii. I. a. 3 )But this cannot be correct, as Strabo (L c.) describesit as an important place in his time. It is nsttaJIvidentified with the village of Monda, SW. of Malara;but it has been pointed out that in the vicinity of ti»modem Monda, there is no plain adapted fur a 6eUof battle, and that the ancient city should probablybe placed near Cordota. It has been supposed thatthe site of Munda is indicated by the remains ofancient walls and towers lying between Marios,Alcaudete, Esprjo, and liana. At all events thissite agrees better with the statement of Strabo, thatMunda is 1400 stadia from Carteia, for the distancefrom the modern Monda to the latter place is only400 stadia; and it is also more in accordance withPliny, who places Munda between Attubi and Ursa.(Forbiger, vol. iii. p 51.) 2. A town of the Celtiberi in Hispania Tarrm-conensis, prolably near the frontiers of the Carpe-tani. (Liv. xl. 47.) 3. A river on the \V. coast of Lusitania, fallinginto the sea between the Tagus and Darius, nowthe MonaVgo. (Plin. iv. 21. s. 35 ; MourJai, Strab.iii. p. 153; Mfjv&at, Ptol. ii. 5. § 4; Maxc. p. 41) MUNDOBRIGA. [Mkdobrioa.]MUXIMENTUM COKBULOXIS. [Corbcuv HIS MlNIMKNTVM ] MUXIMENTUM TRAJAKI, a fort in the coun­try of the Mattiaci. (Amm. Marc. xvii. I.) Itssite is not certain, though it is generally betiewdthat the Roman remains near I/Ocfcst are lb* mistsof this fort. (VVilhelm, 6'ermani™, p. 148.) [L.&] MUNY'CHIA. [Athesae, p. 306.] MUKA'NUM (J/orano), a town of the interior <tLucania, the name of which is not found in anyancient author; but its existence is proved by theItinerary of Antoninus, which places a station Sum-murano, evidently a corruption of Sub Muraoo. oathe road from Nernlum to Consentia; and this isconfirmed by the inscription found at La /Wis[Fuim-m PfiPii.il], which gives the distance fromthat place to Muranum at 74 M. P. It is. thsjtv-fore, evident that Muranum must have occupied thesame site as the modem town of Moron", on a oc-siderable hill, at the foot of which still rum th*high road from Naples to Jtrggio, and wber* w:aasituated the station noticed in llie Itinerary. Nearit are the sources of the river 0*scile. the ancientSybaris. (/tin. Ant. pp. 105, 110; OnrlL Imter.3308: Uomanelli, vol. i. p. 387.) [E. H. B ] MUliUOGI (Moupgoyoi, Ptol. ii. 6. § 52). apeople in Hispania Tarraconensis, the southernneighbours of the Cantabri, are the same as th»people called TritMomo! by Pliny (iii. 3. s. 4) andOrosius (vi. 21). This may be inferred from U«fact that Pliny calls Segisamo a town of the Tur-inodigi, and Ptolemy callt Deubrigula a town atthe Murbogi; while in the Antonine Itinerary (ax449) these two towns aro oedy 15 mika apart.(Forbiger, vol. iii. p. 102.) MUUGA'NTIA, 1. A city of Samniom. mrnti.ir«*ionly by Livy, who calls it "a strong city " (ralkiamtirbem, x. 17), notwithstanding which it was talraliv assault, by the Roman consul P. Itariua, in asingle day, b. <. 296. Its position is fixed by Ko-manelli at Baseliee, a considerable town nrar th*sources of the Eortore (Krento), in the territory a

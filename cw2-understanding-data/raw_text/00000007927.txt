(Polyb. Frg. lib. xxvi.c. 6, vol. iv. p. 345, sqq., ed. Sweigb.) Soon after-wards, however, ive tin J it struggling with theTaurians and tlieir allies the Sarmatians for existence(Polyaen. Strat. viii. c. 56), and it was ultimatelycompelled to place itself under the protection ofMithridates the Great. Subsequently, however, itregained its independence, through the Romans, andunder the name of Cherson or Chorson flourishedtill a late period of the middle ages, and even over­turned the Bosporan kingdom. (Const. Porphyr.de Adm. Imp. c. 53.) Leaving the Heracleotic Chersonese, we will nowproceed to describe the remainder of the coast of theTauric peninsula, which may be soon despatched, asan account of its different cities is given in separatearticles. From the haven of Symbolon (Balaclava)to Theodosia (Cnjj'a) the coast is correctly describedby Strabo as craggy, mountainous, and stormy, andmarked with many headlands (p. 309). The dis­tance, however, which he assigns to this tract of1000 stadia, or 125 miles, is rather too small. Inboth the Periplus of the Euxine the distance given is1320 stadia, but this must include all the indenturesof the coast. The most remarkable promontory inthis part was the Criu-metopon, or Ram's Head,which has been variously identified. Some writershave taken it for the promontory of Laspi, which isill reality the most southern point of the peninsula.Some again have identified it with Ai Petri, and astill greater number with the Aju-dngh. But theaccount given by Arrian and the Anonymous agreesbetter with Cape Aitliodor. These writers say thatthe Ciiu-metopon lay 220 .stadia to the W. of Lam-pas. (Arrian, Peripl, p. 20; Anon. Peripl. p. 6.)Now Lampas is undoubtedly the present BijukLam pat, the distance between which and Cape Ai­tliodor agrees very accurately with the precedingmeasurement. Scymnus indeed (ii. 320, Gail)states the distance at only 120 stadia; but this isevidently an error, as it is too short by half evenfor Ajn-du</!r. Cope Aitkodor is not much N. ofLapsi, and from its position might easily have beentaken by the Greeks for the southernmost point ofthe peninsula. (See Neumann, 451, sq.) From the traces of Greek names, ruins, remains ofmarble columns,&c, it may be inferred that the wholeof this tract was once in the hands of the Greeks.Rut these relics probably belong to the Byzantinetimes, since the older geographers mention only fourplaces on this part of the coast, namely, Cbarax,Lagyra, Lampas. and Athenaeon. To the E. of Theodosia the coast of the Euxinetrends into a large bay, which, approaching the PalusMaeotis on the N., tonus an isthmus about 12 milesbroad, to the E. of which, as far as the CimmerianBosporus, extends the Bosporan peninsula, or thatof Kcrtech, which swells out to double the breadthof the isthmus. The western half of this peninsulais flat; but the eastern portion rises into hills, whichsurround the bay in which Panticapaeumwas situated.It possessed several flourishing maritime towns, asCazeka and Cimmericum on the S. coast; NympbaeonFaritkapaeuin, the Bosporan capital, on the Cim­merian Bosporus; with some others of less note, asMyiinccium, Portlnuiun, and Herinisium.

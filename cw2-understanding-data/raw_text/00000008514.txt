SYRIA. governor of Syria appointed by Pompey, after havingpunched its ruler, the Arabian prince Aretas, tortlie attacks which he had made upon the provincebefore it had been reduced to order, concluded atreaty with him in is. c. G2. It is to this eventthat the coins of Scaurus refer, bearing the inscrip­tion EEX AHHTA9. (lickhei, vol. V. p. 131; cf. Dion Cass, xxxvii. 15; Appian. Sgr. 51 j Joseph.Ant xiv 4. §5,5. § 1.) Damascus was dependenton the Bom ana, and sometimes had a Roman garrison(Hieron. in Isai. c. 17; Joseph. Ant xiv. 11. § 7),though it cannot be doubted that the Arabian kingswere in possession of it, on the condition of paying atribute. It has already been remarked that the citywas in the possession of an ethnarch of Aretas ina.i>. 39: and it was not till the year 105, whenArabia Petraea became a province, that Damascuswas united with Syria, in the proconsulship of Cor­nelius Talma. (Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 330.) On the other hand, Judaea appears to have beenannexed to the province of Syria immediately afterits conquest by Pompey in b.c. 63 (Dion Cass,xxxvii. 15, 16; Eutrop. vi. 14; Liv. Kp. 102;Strab.xvt. p. 762, sq.; Joseph. B* J. i. 7. § 7, Ainni.Mara xiv. 8. § 12); though it retained its own ad­ministration, with regard especially to the taxes whichit paid to the Romans. (Joseph. Ant, xiv. 4. § 4,B. J. i. 7. § 6.) The race of the Jewish kingsended with Aristobulos, whom Pompey, after thecaptnre of Jerusalem, carried to Rome to adorn histriumph (Appian, -Syr. 50; Dion Cass. xxxviL 16;Pint. Pomp. 45; Joseph. Ant. xiv. 4, &c.) Hyr-canua, the brother of Aristobulus, was left indeed inJudaea as chief priest and ethnarch, in which officeshe was confirmed by Caesar; but his dignity wasonly that of a priest and judge. (Dion Cass. I. cjand Joseph. I. c. and xiv. 7. § 2, 10. § 2.) The land,like the province of Syria, was divided for the con­venience of administration into districts or circles ofan aristocratic constitution (Joseph. B.J. \. 8. § 5);and during the constant state of war in which it w;tskept either by internal disorders, or by the incur­sions of the Arabians and Parthians, the presence ofRoman troops, and of the governor of the provincehimself, was almost always necessary. It lias been already related [Jekusai-em, Vol. I.I«. 26] that Antigen US, the son of Aristobulus, ob­tained possession of the throne with the assistanceof the Parthiana in B. C. 40. In the following yearthe Parthians were expelled from Syria by Ven-t id ins (Dion Cass, xlviii. 39—41; Liv. Kpit.127); and in xr. c. 38 Judaea was conquered by So-sius, Antony's legatus, Antigonus was captured andexecuted, and Herod, surnamed the Great, wasplaced upon the throne, which had been promised toIn in two years previously. (Dion Cass. xlix. 19—22; Pint. Anton. 34, sqq.j Tac, Hist. v. 9; Ap­pian, B. C. v. 75; Slrab. xvi. p. 765.) From thistime, Judaea again became a kingdom. With re­gard to the relation of Herod to the Romans we mayremark, that a Roman legion was stationed at Je-rnsalem to uphold his sovereignty, that the oath oft.-alty was taken to the emperor, as lord paramount,as well as to the king, and that the absolute de-pendence of the latter was recognised by the pay­ment ot a tribute and the providing of subsidiarytroops. (Joseph. Ant. XT. 3. § 7, zvii. 2. § 4;Appian, B. C. v. 75.) Herod, therefore, is to beregarded only as a procurator of the emperor, withthe title of king. Antony assigned part of the re-ve lues of Judaea to Cleopatra. (Joseph. Ant. xr. 4. §§ 2, 4.) According to an ordinance rf C«sr.the places in the jurisdiction of Jermlra. »3fc*iexception of Juppa, had to pay a yearly tribal* •fourth of all agricultural produce, whichdelivered the following year in Sid.ni, beside* i taskto be paid to Hyrcanus. {fbid. xiv. 10. §6) hthe seventh, or Sabbath year, however, tfae traaawas intermitted.

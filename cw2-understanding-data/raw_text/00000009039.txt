The Aventine. We have already adverted to the anomalous cha­racter of this hill, and how it was regarded withRuspicmn in the early times of Rome, as ill-omened.Yet there were .several famous spots upon it, havingtraditions connected with them as old or older thanthose relating to the Palatine, as well as several re­nowned and antique temples. One of the oldest ofthese legendary monuments was the Ai.tak ofEvANDBR,which sto->d at the foot of the hill, near thePorta Trigemina. (Dionya. i. 3'2.) Not far from it,near the Salinae, was the Cave of Caccs, a namewhich a part of the hill near the river still retains.(Solinus, i. 8; .cf. Virg. Aai, viii. 190, seq.; Ovid,Fast, i. 551, seq.) Here also was the altar said tohave been dedicated hy Hercules, after he had foundthe cattle, to Jupiter INVKSTOB. (Dionys. i. 39.)A spot on the summit of the hill, called ReMORLa,or Remuria, preserved the memory (if the auspicestaken by Reruns. (Paul. Diac. p. 27C; Dionys. i.85, seq.) Niebuhr, however, assumes another hillbeyond the basilica of St. Paolo, and consequentlyfar OUUlde the walls of Aurelian, to have been theplace called Kemoria, destined by Remus for thebuilding of hie city. (Hist, i. p. 223, seq. and note618.) Other spots connected with very ancienttraditions, though subsequent to the foundation ofthe city, were the Annilustrium and the Lauretum.The AftMlLUflTBt'M, or Annilustrium, at h'rst indi­cated only a festival, in which the soldiers, armedwith ancttfa, performed certain military sports andsacrifices; but the name was subsequently appliedto the place where it was celebrated. (Varr. L.L.v. § 153, vi. § 22, HUH.; Liv. xxvii. 37; Plut Horn.23.) Plutarch (/. c.) says that king Tatius wasburied here; but the Lauretum, so named fromits grove of laurels, is also designated as his placeof sepulture. (Varr. L.L, v. § 152; Plin. xv.§ 40; Dionys. iii. 43; Festus, p. 3Gt>.) There wjisa distinction between the Lauretum Majus and Mi­nus {Cat. (.'apran. Id.

Numa dedicated an altar toJupiter Elicits on the Aventine. (Varr. L.L. vi. § 54; Liv. i. 20; cf. Or. F. iii. 295, wo.); iCalendars indicate a sacrifice to be perfuraai 4to Consus (Fast. Capran. XII.

[Book IV. coteries and parties and yet not directly taking part withone or another; in a way similar to Beranger, of whomthere is much that reminds us in the political and poeticalposition of Lucilius. From this position he uttered hiscomments on public life with a sound common sense thatwas not to be shaken, with a good humour that was inex­haustible, and with a wit perpetually flowing: Sunc rero a mane ad noctem, festo atqite profestoToto itidem pariterq»e die populusqve patresqueJaetare endoforo se omnes, decedere misquam.Uni se atque eidem studio omnes dedere et arti;Verba dare vt caute possint, pwjnare dolose,BlandHii cert ire, boman sinviiare virion seiInsidias facere vt si hostes sint omnibus omnes.

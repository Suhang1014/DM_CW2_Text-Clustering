S.] COIN OF LYSIMACHIA IN THRACE. LYSIMA'CHIA (Awri^ox'a: Eth. Avatnax**1*'.Papadluites), a town of Ai'tolia. situated upon thesouthern shore of the lake formerly called Hyriaor Hydra, and subsequently Lysitnachia, after thistown, [Respecting the lake, sec Aktoi.ia, p. 64, a.]The town was probably founded by Arsinoe, andnamed after her first husband Lysimachus, since weknow that she enbvged the neighbouring town ofConope, and railed it Arsinoe after herself. [Co­nope.] The position of the town is determined bythe statement of Stralio that it lay between l'leuronand Conope, and by that of Livy, who places it onthe line of inarch from Naupactus and Calydon toStratus. Its site, therefore, corresponds to J'ajHid-hates, where Leake discovered some Hellenic remains.It was deserted in Strabo's time. (.Strab. p 400;Pol. v. 7; Liv. xxxvi. 11 ; Steph.

[Sybaci;sae.] LYSIXOE (\vvtv6ri) or LYSISIA (Auo-iWo,Ptol. v. 5. § 5). a small town in the north of Pisidia,on the south of the Ascania Laous, and west ofSagalassus. (1'olyb. Ere. de Leg 32; Liv. xxxviii.15; Hicrocl. p. 680, who calls it Lyseuura,Avtr^tvapa.) [L.

(Acts,xiv. 8, 21; Timoth. iii. 11 ; comp. Hierocl. p. 67 j.)A bishop of Lystra was present at the Council ofChalcedon. Leake (Aria Minor, p. 102) isinclined to place the town at Khatom Serai, about30 miles south of Iconium; but Hamilton (/2e-searrhis, vol. ii. p. 313), with more a(i]iearancc ofprobability, identifies its site with the ruins of Kn-adnt/h, which are generally believed to be the re­mains of Derlw. [L. S.] LYTARX1S, a promontory in Northern Europe,mentioned by Pliny (vi. 12. s. 14). His text makesthe promontory of Lytamis, at one and the sametime, a portion of the Celtic country and the extre­mity of the lUiipaean range — the Rhijiacan moun­tains being the Vralian — " extra eos " (i e. theN-ythians), " ultraipie Aquilonia initia Hyperboreosaliqui posuerc, pluribus in Europe dictoa. Priinuminde noacitur promontorium Celticae Lytamis, fla­vins Caramburis, nbi huaau cum siderum vi Riphae-onun mootium deficiunt juga." In the eyes of Uiephysical geographer, the extremity of the Vralianchain is either the island of A'orxi Zembla or themost northern portion of the district uu the west of the sea of Obi,—the Obi being the Carambork. bthe usual maps, however, the Ihrina is the Carmn.-bucis, and \anin Xoss, on the east of the White Sea,the Lvtannis Prom. [R. G. L-] LYTTUS. [Lyctus.] MAACAH, BETH-MAACAH v. ABEL BETH-MA ACAH (MoaXa, B»fluaax<i, AfliA ottou MooX« >.a city of Palestine, placed by Eusebius and St. Je­rome on the road between Eleutheropolis and Je­rusalem, 8 miles from the former, the site of whichwas then marked by a village named Mechanum. Itis clear, however, that the Abel Beth Maaeah of tbosacred writers could not have been situated so farsouth. It is first mentioned in iSamuel, xx. 14.oV.,as the city in which the rebel Sheba was besiegedby Joab. From this passage, however, it may begathered (1.) that Abel was not identical withBelh-Maacah, for the copula is inserted betweenthe names ("unto Abel and unto Betli-Maacah");(2.) that it was situated at the extremity of tl.eland of Israel,for Joab " went through all the tribe*of Israel" to come there. Abel then, which was, as''the wise woman" called it, "a city and a motherin Israel" (ver. 19), was so called from its u»d-tignity to Beth-Maacah, (so Reland, Palaestina,p. 519); and this must have been situated imwthe northern frontier, for it is mentioned with Ij-.uand Dan, and Cinneroth and Naphthali (1 King: xv.20), as one of the cities taken by Benhadad, kingof Syria, from Baasha, king of Israel; and two cen­turies later it was one of the cities of Israel fir>toccupied by Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria. (2Kings, xv. 29.) Eusebius mentions three placesnamed Abel:—1. a village three miles from Phila­delphia; 2. a city 12 miles east of (ladara: 3. an­other between Paneas and Damascus. (Omomnsi.s. r.) lMaml justly remarks (L c) that if anyone of these is to be taken as AM of Beth-Maaraliit must be the last-named; but that he is more dis­posed to look for it in Galilee, to the west or southof Paneas, rather than to the east or north, on iImsDamascus road. This view is perhaps confirmed bya comparison of 2 Chron. xvi. 4. with I King*, x»20.; the Abel Beth Maaeah of the latter beingcalled AM Maim, or "Abel of the Waters" in to*latter, probably so named eiilier from the era. ofCinneroth or from the sea of Galilee. Dr. Robin* -nsuggests its identity with the modem village of Abil, or lbel-el-Knml-h, or Alii or Ibel el /raira,both situated in the Mrrj \lywn, which last nan*is certainly identical with the ancient Ijan, withwhich Abel Beth-Manrah is associated in 1 Kings,xv. 20. (Robinson, Bib. Res. vol. iii. pp. 346, n. JL347, n. 1., and Appendix, pp. 136, 137, n. 1.) Maaeah is used as an adjunct to Syria or Aramin 1 Chron. xix. 6, 7, but its situation is not de­fined. (Reland, Palaestina. p. 118.) The existence of the Maarathites (Max«*0 onthe east of Jordan, apparently between Bathan endMount Ilennon, contiguous to the Geshnntea(/Am/, iii. 14; Josh, xii. 5, xiii. 11, 13) intimatesthat another city or district of the name M uu ahwas situated in that quarter.

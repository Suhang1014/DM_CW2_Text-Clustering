While the Romans languished under the igno- chap.minious tyranny of Constantius, the praises of Julian XVILwere repeated with transport in every part of the The jea-empire, except in the palace of the emperor. The Constan.Barbarians of Germany had felt, and still dreaded, j^fmthe arms of the young Caesar; his soldiers were thecompanions of his victory; the grateful provincialsenjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favourites,who had opposed his elevation, were offended by hisvirtues; and they justly considered the friend of thepeople as the enemy of the court. As long as thefame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of thepalace, who were skilled in the language of satire,tried the efficacy of those arts which they had sooften practised with success. They easily discovered,that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation:the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage, of an apeinvested with the purple, were applied to the dressand person of the philosophic warrior; and his modestdespatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaboratefictions of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier,who had studied the art of war amidst the groves ofthe academy. The voice of malicious folly was atlength silenced by the shouts of victory; the con­queror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longerbe painted as an object of contempt; and the mon­arch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing fromhis lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours.

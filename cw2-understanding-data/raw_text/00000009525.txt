OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXI. 349 might have limited the decree in such a manner, thatnot the pretor, but the consul, should have the manage­ment of it: or else the consul had acted wrong, who afterordering the army to remove from Etruria into Gaul,did not meet it at Ariminum, in order to be present atoperations, which were not allowed to be performedwithout him. But the exigences of war do not wait forthe delays and procrastinations of commanders; andbattles must be sometimes fought, not because com­manders choose it, but because the enemy compels it.The fight itself, and the issue of the fight, is what oughtto be regarded now. The enemy were routed and slain,their camp taken and plundered, the colony relievedfrom a siege, the prisoners taken from the other colonyrecovered and restored to their friends, and an endput to the war in one battle. And not only men re­joiced at this victory, but the immortal gods also hadsupplications paid to them for the space of three days,on account of the business of the state having beenwisely and successfully, not rashly and unfortunately,conducted by Lucius Furius, pretor. Besides, theGallic wars were, by some fatality, destined to theFurian family.' 49. By means of discourses of this kind, made byhim and his friends, the interest of the pretor, whowas present, prevailed over the respect due to thedignity of the absent consul, and the majority decreeda triumph to Lucius Furius. Lucius Furius, pretor,during his office triumphed over the Gauls. He carriedinto the treasury three hundred and twenty thousandasses,i and one hundred and seventy thousand pounds'weight of silver. There were neither any prisonersled before his chariot, nor spoils carried before him,nor did any soldiers follow him. It appeared thatevery thing except the victory belonged to the consul.Publius Scipio then celebrated in a magnificent man­ner the games which he had vowed when consul in i 1033/. 6s. 8d.

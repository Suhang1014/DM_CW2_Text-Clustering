[V.] NIGEIR or NIGIB (Nryeip, Ptol. iv. 6. § 14;Nryip, Agathem. ii. 10; Niger, gen. Nigria, Plin.v. 4, 8, viii. 32), a great river of interior Libya,flowing from W. to E. It has long been a mootpoint among geographers whether the Kigeir ofthe ancients should be identified with the rivernow known as the Djolibd or Quorra, which, aftertaking its course through the va*t plains or low­lands of Central Africa, turns southwards towardsthe Bight of Benin, where it enters the sea. Forinstance, Gosselin {Geographic de» Ancient, vol. i.pp. 125—135) came to the conclusion that the an-cients possessed no knowledge of N\V. Africa to theS. of the river Nun. Walekenaer(/?eV«rrcA« Geo-graphiques sur C/nterieur de VAfriqve Sej)ien-tritmaU, Paris. 1821) also, who has carefully dis­cussed this point, sums up the result of his inquiriesby asserting' that none of Ptolemy's rivers can bethe same as the Djolibd or any other stream of theBiledu-l-Siuldn, as that region was quite unknownto antiquity, and was, in reality, discovered by theArabs. Following in the same track, Mr. Coolcy(Chtuditu Ptolemy and the Nile, London, 185-1)regards the Nigeir as a hypothetical river, repre­senting collectively the waters of the BiUdu-l-Jerid.On the other hand, Colonel Leake {Journ. Geog.Soc. vol. ii. pp. 1—28), whose views are adopted inthe present article, considers that Ptolemy's informa­tion on the J>jolib(i or Qttorra*, although extremelyimperfect, was real. There seems, indeed, to bereason for believing that its discovery may be placedat a much earlier period, and that its banks werereached by the young Nasamones. [Nasamones.]Ptolemy's statements (/. c.) are annexed, from whichit will be seen that the arguments in favour of theidentity of his Nigeir with the Quorra are verystrong. He believed that the earth was spherical;he divided the great circle into 360°; of these de-frees he placed the same number in the breadth ofN. Africa, that modern observations con6rm; in thelength of the same country he errod only one-tenthin execs*. While in the interior, proceeding from apoint of the \V. coast, where his positions approxi­mate to modern geography, he placed a great river,flowing from \V. to E., exactly in the latitude wherethe Q'tftrra flows in that direction.* In considering the exact meaning of this passage, • In the interior of Libya, sajs Ptolemy, the two greatest rivers are th« Geir and the Nlpctr. ~. „ , E.Iong.

Of the general direction of the mi—gof the Nigeir there can be no doubt, as the Latitudesand longitudes of the towns on its banks (§§ 2 4—28) prove a general bearing of E. and \V.; aad frmits not being named among the riven of the W_coast (§ 7), it must have been suppnwi to nWfrom \V. to E. The lake Libye, to whirh there *a*an E. divergent, thongh its position (alls 3<>0 tTK-miles to the NW. of Lake Tsckad, may be prenmwito represent this, the principal lake of the interior;it was natural that Ptolemy, like many of uWmodems, should have been misinformed as to lisposition, and communication of the river with t£*lake. It is now, indeed, known that the river d***»not communicate with Ixike T*chnd, and that it isnot a river of the interior in Ptolemy'a ten*e; thatits sources are in a very different latitude fnen thuwhich he has given; and its course varirt caav-sidcrably from the enormous extent of direction tothe E., which results from his portion of the townson its banks.

BAMBBOCA. that Oinri built, it merely as a palatial residence(Sinai and Palestine, p. 240); but Dr. Robinsonl*rhuptj more just 1 j concludes that it was chosen asthe site of the capital, and remarks that " it wouldh* difficult to find in all Palestine a situationof equal strength, fertility, and beauty combined."{Bihl. Res. iii. p. 146.) Its great strength is at­tested by the fact that it endured a siege from allthe jjower of the Syrian army under Hazael, in thedays of Jehoram (cir. B.C. 892), little more than30 years after its first foundation, and was not takennotwithstanding the frightful effects of the faminewithin the walls (2 Kittys, vii. 24—viii. 20); andwhen subsequently besieged by the Assyrians (cir.j;. c. 721) it was only reduced after a siege of threeyours (xviii. 9, 10). After the captivity it was takenby John Hyrcanus, after a year's siege, when he issaid to have sapped the foundations of it with waterand destroyed all traces of a city. It was subse­quently occupied by the Jews until Pompey restoredit to its owu inhabitants. It was further restoredby Gabinius. (Joseph. Ant. xiii. 10. § 3, 15. § 4,siv. 4. § 4, 5. § 3, xiii. 10. § 3, 15. §4.) It wasgranted to Herod the Great by Augustus on thedeath of Antony and Cleopatra, and was by him con­verted into a Roman city under the name of Sebaste—Augusta, in honour of his imperial patron. {Ant.xv. 3. 3, 7, 8. § 5, B. J. i. i>0. § 3.) The townwas surrounded with a wall 20 stadia in length; inthe middle of the town was a temple built in honourof Caesar, itself of large dimensions, and standing ina tcinenos of I.J stadium square. It was colonisedwith 6000 veterans and others, to whom was as­signed an extremely fertile district around the city.{B. J. i. 21. § 2.) Dr. Robinson imagines that itwas in this city that Philip first preached the Gos­pel, and that the church was founded by the apostlesSt. Peter and St. John {Acts, viii, 5, &c); but con-sidering the absence of the article in the original,supplied in the English translation, and comparingthe passage with the identical expression in St. John(iv. 5), it is more probable that the same town is in­tended, viz. Sychar, or Neapolis, the chief seat ofthe Samaritan worship. Nor does the expression inActs (viii, 14), that "Samaria had received the wordof God," militate against this view; for here also thecountry may be very well understood, and it is wellremarked by Dr. Robinson that u it is sometimesdifficult to distinguish whether, under the name Sa­maria, the city or the region is meant." {Bill. Re$.iii. p. 146.) It is most probable, however, that thesacred writers would have used the classical namethen in vogue had they had occasion to mention thecity. Sepiimius Sevcrus placed a clony there in thebeginning of the third century (Ulpian, quoted byKubinson, I. c. p 148, n. 1), and it was probably atthat time an episcopal see; for its bishop, Marius orMarinus, was present at the Council of Nicaea andsubscribed its acts. (Le Quien, Orient Ckristianus,vol. iii. col. 549—552.) The tradition which as­signs Sebaste as the place of St. John Baptist's im­prisonment and martyrdom is first found in St. Je­rome (Comment in Osee, i. 5). who also places therethe tombs of Obadiah and Elisha {Comment in Ab-dtam, i. 1, Epitaph. Pauhte, c. 6), and militatesagainst Joseph us, whose statement, however, is inad­missible. [Maciiakiu's.] The modern villagewhich represents in its name and site the magnificentcity of Herod the Great is situated on an isolatedlull 6 milei N. of Nablus, reckoned by Josephusa day's journey from Jeru>aletu. {Ant. xv. 11.)

Ib. vii. 3. § 32, seq.; Tac. Ann. iv. 47). Their music was rude and noisy. Strabo (x. p.471) compares it to that of the Phrygians, whom,indeed, he regards as descended from the Thracians.Xcnophon, in the passage last referred to, says thatthey played on horns and on trumpets made of rawox-hide. Their worship of Dionysus and Cotyttowas celebrated on mountain tops with loud instru­ments of music, shouting, and noises like the bellow­ing of cattle. (Strab. x. p. 470.) Their barbarity and ferocity became proverbial.Herodotus (viii. 116) tells a story of a king of thelii-altae, who punished his six sons for disobeyinghim by putting out their eyes. Seuthes, with hisown hand, transfixed some of the Thyni who hadbeen taken prisoners (Xen. A nab. vii, 4. § 6). Rhas-cuporis invited his nephew to a banquet, plied himwith wine, then loaded him with fetters, and after­wards put him to death. (Tac. Ann. ii. 64, seqq.)Thucydides (vii. 27, seq.) gives an instance of tlieferocity of tlie Thracians in their massacre of theinhabitants of Mycalessus. A truly barbarian trait in the character of theThracians was their faithlessness, even to oneanother. This is especially shown in their disregardof their obligations towards the hostages whom theypave as securities for their observance of theirengagements with others. Seuthes had receivedfrom the Thyni a number of old men as hostages;yet the Thyni, seeing a favourable opportunity,as they supposed, for renewing hostilities, at onceseized it, apparently without u thought of the buttoo probable consequences of such conduct to theirhelpless countrymen. (Xen. Anal. vii. 4. § 21; cf.Liv. xl. 22). Some of the tribes inhabiting theThracian coast of the Euxine were systematicwreckers [Salmydessus]. Robbery, as we haveseen, was considered honourable by them; andj.lunder was their chief inducement to engage inwar. (Strab. vii. p. 318; Cic Pis. 34; Liv. xxvi.2"). xxxviit. 40, seq.) Strabo (iii. pp. 1G4, 105),Mela (ii. 2), and Tacitus {Attn. iv. 51) bearwitness to tlie bravery of the Thracian women. The deity most worshipped by the Thracians wasDionysus, whom they, as well as the Phrygians,called Sabazius. (Schol. Arutoph. Ye*pm 9.) Themythical stories respecting Orpheus and Lycurgusare closely connected with the worship of this god,who had an oracle on Rhodope, in the country of theSatrae, but under the direction of the Iiessi [Satrak].Herodotus (vii. Ill) states that the mode of deliver­ing the answers of this oracle resembled that whichprevailed ;it Delphi. lie compares also the wor­ship of Artemis (whose Thracian name was Bendisor Cotytto), as he had seen it celebrated by Thra­cian and Paeonian women, with some of the ceremo­nies at Delos (iv. 33). These resemblances may beaccounted for on the supposition that the Thracianrites were derived from the original Pelasgian popu­lation, remnants of which may have maintainedthemselves amid the mountain histnesses; as Xiebuhrholds (Ethnog. and Geoff, i. p. 287) was the casewith the Paeonians, who are mentioned by Herodotusin the passage last referred to.

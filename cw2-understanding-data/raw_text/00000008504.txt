(Boblayc, Rtchtrckes,«jV. p. 52; Leake, Ptloponnesiaca, p. 268; Curtius,Pehpotmesos, rol. ii. p. 395.) 2. A city of BoeotiiL [Lebapeia.] MIDIANTTAE (MaSmwrai), the descendants ofMidian, one of the suns of Abraham by Keturah,whom the patriarch is said to have sent away duringhis lifetime ** eastward, unto the east country"{Gen. xxv. 2,6), and whom we subsequently findreckoned among " the children of the east." (Judy.vi. 3.) In the third generation after Abraham theywere a distinct people, trading between Gilead andEgypt; but are associated with, or confoundedwith, another Arab family, the Ishmaclites. {Gen.xxxviii. 25, 28, 3G.) The Midianites were probably a Bcdawi tribe,and their situation may be pretty accurately de­termined, by the fallowing notices, to the territoryafterwards occupied by the Nabataei, to the southand east of Falaestiue. Muses fed the sheep ofJethro, a priest of Midian. in the peninsula of MountSinai, and about Mount Horeb (Exod, iii. 1); sub­sequently Jethro came to his son-in-law from theland of Midian, while Israel was encamped in thevicinity of Horeb (xviii. 2, &c.); and Moses wasglad to avail himself of his local knowledge whiletraversing the desert to the north of the peninsula.(Numb. x. 29—32). The close alliance betweenthe Midianites and the Moabites, to oppose the pro­gress of Israel, indicates the proximity of the twopeoples; and the hostility of the former proves thatthe alliance of Moses with one of their family didnot conciliate the national feeling. (Xumb. xxii. 4, 7,xxv. xjtxi. 8—12 ; Jo*h, xiii. 21.) The Midianites continued the bitter enemies ofthe Israelites throughout the period of the Judges,when, in concert with "the Arnalekites and thechildren of the east," they invaded simultaneously,and in countless numbers, the southern frontiertowards Gaza and the trans-Jordanic tribes inGilead and Bashaii (Judy. vi. vii.), from whencethey extended their ravages to the west, andnorth as fur as the confines of Kaphthali andAsher. After their signal defeat by Gideon, theydisappear from the records of history, but theirslaughter became proverbial (Psalm Uxxiii. 9;Isaiah, ix. 4, x. 26.) The country of the Midianites, however, hadstill a traditionary recollection; and subsequent no­tice*, consistently with the foregoing, place thembetween Edom and i'uran, which bordered on Egypt(1 Kings, xi. 17, 18), in the country afterwardscomprehended under the name of Idumaea, and stilllater assigned to the Saracen I. Indeed Jo&ephus(.4 nt iv, 7. § 1) asserts that Petra, tho capital ofArabia (i. e. Idumaea), was called by the nativesAreceme' ('Ap«*f^tVi), from the Midianitish kingKekem. one of the five slain by Moses. (Xumb.xxxi. 8) Eusebitu and St. Jerome mention a cityMadian, so named after one of the sons of Abrahamby Keturah, situated beyond Arabia (i.e. Idumaea)to the south, in the desert of the Saracens, by theBed Sea, from which the district was called; andanother city of the same name near the Anion andAreopolis; the ruins of which only existed in theirdays. (OnomasL $. v.; com p. Hieron. Cvmm. ad Jts.Ix. and Ezech. xxv.) The situation of these two cities would definethe limits uf the territory of the Midianites in their most palmy days. The former of tbw*two cities is doubtless that mentioned by JtwfJw(Ant. ii. 11. § 1) under the name of M»iwm(MaoYnp^), situated at the Red Sea, and *properly identified by Keland as the m^ern 1/i-dyan (the Madiun of Abulfeda), identical with iLtMnriiana of Ptolemy. (Keland, PalarMtata, pp. i:*—100.) It is situated about half-way 6mthe eastern coast nf the Elanitic gulf. (Fentrr,Geog. i>f Arabia, vol. ii. p. 116; and h«e the rrfc-rences in his index under Midian.) [G. W.] MIEZA (Mi«fo: Eth. Mi«fo«»T, Mi«f>fa), aMacedonian city, the position of which it is mostdifficult toascertain. Stephanus of Byzantium (a.r.),on the authority of Theagenes, assigns to an rp>ey-mous founder, Mieza, a sister of Ben*a, and grand­daughter of Macedon: this legend implies that itwas an important city. Krom the name it wouldseem most natural to l<*ok for it in the neigbbourhrtdof Beroea, which agrees with Ptolemy (iii 13. §39),who classes it among the cities of Emathia, Stc­phanus, on the other hand, still deriving his in­formation apparently from Theagenes, alludes to itas a t6vos ^TpvpSrot, and adds tliat it was some­times called Stryuioninm. Alexander the Gmiestablished an Aristotelian school at Mieza (I'.x*.Alex. M. 7); and it was famed for a stmlicutaccavern. (Plin. xxxi. 2. s. 20; Leake, A'orta. Greece,vol. iv. p. 583.) [E. B. J.] MIGDOL, a Hebrew word signifying ** a tower,"and used as a complement of several proper namesof places in Holy Scripture. 1. Migdol-Edek, translated in (Ten. xxxr. 31(v. 16 in LXX.), tov wiyyov TaSip, Autk Ver."the tower of Eder;" and in Mkak, iv. 8.. »*Vr*»wotuviov, Auth. Ver. "tower of the flock * (mare."Edar").

((A*»*rnast. s. r.; Keland, Palaestina, «. r. p. 898.) 2. Miopol-El, a town in the tribe of N*phth*it(Josh, xix. 38), where the LXX, running twonames together, read MtyaXaaptfs for ** MigdaW,Horem." Eusebins and St Jerome mention it a* alarge village named Magdiel, ix. M. P. (St. Jenaaawrites v. M.

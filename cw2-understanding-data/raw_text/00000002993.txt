And now Herod sailed home with joy, at the unexpectedgood success he had had: and went first of all, as was proper, tothis his wife, and told her, and her only, the good news, as pre­ferring her before the rest, on account of his fondness for her,and the intimacy there had been between them, and saluted her;but so it happened, that as he told her of the good success he hadhad, she was so far from rejoicing at it, that she rather was sorryfor it; nor was she able to conceal her resentments, but, de­pending on her dignity, and the nobility of her birth, in returnfor his salutations, she gave a groan, and declared evidently thatshe rather grieved than rejoiced at his success, and this till He­rod was disturbed at her, as affording him not only marks ofher suspicion, but evident signs of her dissatisfaction.

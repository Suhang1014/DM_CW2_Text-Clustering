So it happened that his friends despair­ed, and had no hopes of his escape, but for his enemies, they alloutwardly appeared to be troubled at his case, but were privatelyvery glad of it, as hoping to obtain a change for the better.As for Herod himself, he saw that there was no one of royal dig­nity left but Hyrcanus, and therefore he thought it would be forhis advantage not to suffer him to be an obstacle in his way anylonger; for that in case he himself survived, and escaped the dan­ger he was in, he thought it the safest way to put it out of thepower of such a man to make any attempt against him, at such C' mctures of affairs, as was more worthy of the kingdom thanimself; and in case he should bo slain by Caesar, his envyprompted him to desire to slay him that would otherwise beking after him. 2.

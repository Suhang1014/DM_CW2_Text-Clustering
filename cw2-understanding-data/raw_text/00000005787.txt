Theycall Juno, Teleia, or the perfect. There is a large statueof the goddess in an upright position: both these sta­tues are made of Pentelican stone, and are the works ofPraxiteles. There is another statue of Juno in a sittingposture in the same temple; and this wa§ made by Cal-limachus. But they call the goddess Numpheuemenc, orespoused, on the following account. CHAP. III. TliEY fay, that Juno being angry with Jupiter, on,what account it is not known, retired to Euboea; andJupiter not being able to appease her, came to Cithæron,who then reigned over the Platæenses. This Cithseronwas not second to any one in craft. He therefore per-;suaded Jupiter to make a statue of wood, to phee it veiledin a car drawn by two oxen, and publicly assert that thiswas Flatæa, the daughter of Asopus, whom he was goingto marry. As soon as Juno heard this, she immediatelycame to the car, and, cutting off the veil, perceived thatwhat stie supposed was a new married lady, was nothingmore than a wooden image; and in consequence of this-'became reconciled to Jupiter. In remembrance of thisreconciliation, they celebrate a festival which is calledDædal, because the ancients called wooden statues Dæda­lian. But it appears to me that this name was usurped,before Dædalus the son of Palamaon was born; and thatafterwards, from Dædalian statues Dædalus derived his name.

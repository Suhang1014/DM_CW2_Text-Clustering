The duty of an his- Ourperpiext- * ty in defining torian does not call upon him to interpose his private judgment in the miracu-this nice and important controversy; but he ought not to dissemble '°US fericd*the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interestof religion with that of reason, of making a proper application ofthat theory, and of defining with precision the limits of that happyperiod exempt from error and from deceit, to which we might bedisposed to allow the gift of supernatural powers.

They still supported their

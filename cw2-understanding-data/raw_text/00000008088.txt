It is con­spicuously mentioned during the First Tunic War.when it was in the hands of the Carthaginians, andwas besieged by the Romans, but for some time with­out success, on account of the great strength of itsposition; it was at length taken by the consul A.Atitius Calatinus in u. c. 258. The inhabitantswere either put to the sword or sold as slaves, andthe town itself entirely destroyed. (Pol. i. 21;Diod. xxiii. 1». Exc. Hoetch. p. 503; Zonar. riij.)It was, however, again inhabited at a later period, aswe tiiid the Mutustratini mentioned by Pliny amongthe municipal towns of the interior of Sicily. (Plin. iii.8. s. 14.) But no notice of its name occurs in theinterval, and Cluveritu (who has been followed bymany modern geographers) would, therefore, identifyMytistratus with Amestratus; an assumption forwhirh there are certainly no sufficient grounds, bothnames being perfectly well attested, [Amkstka-tcs.] (Cluver. Steal p. 383.) [E. H. B.] MYUS(MvotJj: F.th. Mpowtms), an Ionian townin Caria. on the southern bank of tlx* Maeander, at adistance of 3U stadia from the mouth of that river.Its foundation was ascribed to Cydrelus, a naturalson of Codrus, (.Strab. jut. p. 633.) It was thesmallest among the twelve Ionian cities, and in thedays of Strabo (xiv. p. 636) the population was soreduced that they did not form a political commu­nity, but became incorporated with Miletus, whitherin the end the Myusians transferred themselves,abandoning their own town altogether. This lastevent happened, according to Pausanias (vii. 2. § 7),on account of the great Dumber of flies which an­noyed the inhabitants; but it was more probablv onaccount of the frequent inundations to which theplace was exposed. (V'itruv. iv. 1.) Myus was oneof the three towns given to Theinistocles by thePersian king (Thucyd. i. 138; Diod. Sic. xi. 57;Pint Them. 29; Athen. i. p. 29; Nep. Them. 10.)During the Peloponnesian War the Athenians ex­perienced a check near this place tVo:n the C'aiians.(Thucyd. iii. 10.) Philip of Macedonia, who hadobtained possession of Myus, ceded it to the Mag-nesians. Athen. iii. p. 78.) The only edificenoticed by the ancients at Myus was a temple ofDionysus, built of white marble. (Paus.LcJ) Themmense quantity of deposits carried down by theMaeander have considerably removed the coast-ltne.■o that even in Strabo's time the distance betweenMyus and the sea was increased to 40 stadia (xii.p. 571*), while originally the town had no doubtbeen built on the coast itself. There still are someruins of Myus, which most travellers, forgetting thechanges wrought by the Maeander, have mistakenfor those of Miletus, while those of Heracleia havebeen mistaken for those of Myus. (Comp. Leake,Asia Minor, p. 239, &c.) The mistake is repeatedby Sir C. Fellows (Journal of a Tour in As* Min.p. 263), though it had been pointed out long beforehis time. [L. S.] N.

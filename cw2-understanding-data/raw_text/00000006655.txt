Great parr of this day was spent in advancing to­wards, and retiring from, one another, and in recipro­cal endeavours to seize advantages; but neither sidewas able to execute any remarkable piece of service,excepting that the Syracusans lunk one or two of theAthenian ships; upon which they parted, and at thefame time the land-army drew off from the intrench-ments.

The transports he ranged in a line, at the distanceof the breadth of two * plethra from one another; that,in case a ship was repulsed, it might run in hither as a.place of scqurity, and might again stand out withoutany molestation. In persecting these dispositions the 'Athenians were all this day employed from morning tonighf. The next day, the Syracusans, earlier in the morn­ing than before, and with the fame parade of their landand naval force, came out to attack the Athenians.Now again, facing each other in the lines of engage­ment, they spent great part of the day in the same en- , deavours as before to over-reach and surprise one ano­ther; till, at length, Aristo, the son of Pyrricus, aCorinthian, and the most expert seaman in the fleet ofSyracuse, persuades the commanders of that fleet todispatch their orders to the magistrates within the city,—"with all expedition to bring the provisions which"were for sale down to the beach of the sea, and hold"the market there; nay, farther, to compel all those * A plttbnti is said by seme to contain 1444, by others, 1000 square feet. ** who

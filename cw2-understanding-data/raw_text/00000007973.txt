Theyseem to have followed the Cherusri still farther tothe sonth-east, as Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 23) placesthem on the south of the Chatti, near the ThurhtyerWald, between the rivers f'ulda and Werra (Conip.Tac. derm. 36). In the end we find them againas a member of the confederacy of the Franks.(Nazarius, Paney. Const. 18.) The name Subattiiin Strata (vii. p. 292) is probably only an error ofthe transcriber, whence Kramer has changed it intoTovMttioi. (Wilhelm. Germanien, p. 130.)

It was once a place of somaimportance, but afterwards declined, thoagh even ata late jeriod it seems tn have had a Roman garrison(\ot. Imp., where it is called Tubusubdus).

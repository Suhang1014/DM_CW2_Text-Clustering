G5,7o, 71) and by Diodorus (Fr. lib. viii. vol. iv. p. 21,Bipont). The sum of the reigns here given, allowingJive years for that of Aeneas, who died in the seventhyear after the taking of Troy, is 432 years —that is, down to the .second year of Numitor, whenKoine was founded by Romulus, in the first year ofthe 7lh Olympiad. Now this agrees very closelywith Varro's era for the foundation of Rome, viz.,753 b. c. For Troy having been taken, accordingto the era of Eratosthenes, in 118-t n. a, the differ­ence between 1184 and 7.r)3 leaves 431 years forthe duration of the Alban kingdom. Varro's date for the foundation of Rome is thatgenerally adopted. Other authorities place it ratherlater: Cato. in 751 B.C.; Poly bins, in 750; FabiusPic tor, in 747. This is not the place to enter into the questionwhether these dates of the Alban kings were theinvention of a later age, in order to satisfy the re­quirements of chronology. It will suffice to remarkthat the next most prevalent opinion among thoseRomans who adopted the main points of this traditionassigned only three centuries to the Alban kingsbefore the foundation of Rome, This was the opinionof Virgil (Am. i. 272),— "Ilic jam terccntum totos regnabitur annos," — of Justin, of Trogus Pompeius (xliii. 1), and ofI,ivy (i. 29), who assigns a period of 4i>0 yearsfor the exigence of Alba, and places its destructiona century after the foundation of Rome. At allevents the preponderance of testimony tends verystrongly to show that Rome was not founded tillseveral centuries after the Trojan AVar. Timaeuswems to have been the first Greek writer whoadopted the account of the foundation of Rome byRomulus. (Niebuhr, Hist. vol. i. p. 218.) II. The City or Romulus. The Roman historians almost unanimously relatethat Rome originally consisted of the city founded byRomulus tin The Palatine. (Liv. i. 7; Veil. i. 8;Tar. Ann. xii. 24; Dionys. i. 88; (Jell. xiii. 14; Ov.TV. iii. 1. 29, &c.) The ancient settlement (if Evan-der 'in the same hill, as well as a city on the Capi-toline called Saturnia (Varr. L. L. v. § 42, Mull.;FVhtus, p- 322, Mull.), and another on Mons Jani-cutus called Aenea or Antipolis (Dionys. i. 73; Plin.iii. 9). must he supposed to have disappeared at thetime lit its foundation, if indeed they had ever existed.It seems probable enough, as Dionysius says, thatvillages were previously scattered about on theseven hills ; but the cxt>tence of a place called Vu-tica or Vaticum, on the right bank of the Tiber, andof a Quirium on the Quirinal, rests solely on theconjecture of Jsiebuhr {Hist. vol. i. p. 223, seq.,289, ^eq., Eng.

Pomoerium.—Tacitus has given in the followingpassage, the fullest, and most authentic account of thecircuit of the Romulean city: "Sed initium con-dendi, et quod pomoerium Romulus posuerit, noscerebaud absurdum reor. Igitur a foro Boario, ubiaereum tauri simulacrum adspicimns, quia id genusanimalium aratro subditur, sulcus designandi oppidicoeptus, ut magnam llerculis aram amplecteretur.Inde certis spatiis interject! lapides, per una inontisl'alatini ad aram Consi, mox ad Curias Veteres,turn ad saccllum Laium; forumque Romanum et Capitolium non a Romulo sed a Tito Tatio ji-'jsurbi credidcre."

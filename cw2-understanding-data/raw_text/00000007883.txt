SALENTINI. had as early as tins pushed their arms into thelapygian peninsula, and it is probable that theSalentines are here confounded with the Peucetians,with whom, according tu .some accounts, they wereclo»e]y connected. (Plin. iii. 11. 8. 1G.) Hut thename is used with still greater laxity shortly after,when Livy speaks of Thuriae ;ls " Qrbem in Sallen-tii.is " (x. 2), if at least, as there seems little doubt,the place there meant is the well-known city ofThurii in Lucania [Titmin]. The name of the Sallentines does not again oomrin history till the Fourth Samnite War, when theyjoined the confederacy formed by the Samnitcs andTarentines against Home; and shared in their defeatby the consul L. Aemilius Barbula in b. c. 281. a?,we find that general celebrating a triumph over theTarentines, Sammtes, and Sallentines. (Fast. Capit.ann. 47.'i.) For some time after this the appear­ance of Pyrrkus in Italy drew off the attention ofthe 1 tomans from more ignoble adversaries, but whenthat monarch had finally withdrawn from Italy, andTarentum itself had fallen into the hands of theRomans, they were left at leisure to turn theirarms against the few tribes that still maintainedtheir independence. In n. c. 207 war was declaredagainst the Salentines, and both consuls were em­ployed in their subjugation. It way not likely thatthey could oiler much resistance, yet their finalconquest was not completed till the following year,when both consuls aL'ain celebrated triumphs '* dcMessapits Salientiuisque." (Fast. Capit; Zonar. viii.7; Liv. F.pit. xv; Florus, i. 20; Eutrop. ii. 17.)All the Roman writers on this occasion mention theSalentines alone; the Triumphal Fasti, however, re­cord the name of the Messapians in conjunction withthem, and it is certain that both nations wereincluded both in the war and the conquest, forBrnndusium, which is called by Florus "caputregionis," and the occupation of which was evidentlythe main object of the war (Zonar. /. c), seems tohave been at that period certainly a Messapian city.The Salentines are again mentioned as revolting toHannibal during the Second Punic War (B.C. 213),but seem to have been again reduced to subjectionwithout difficulty. (Liv. xxv. 1, xxvii. 41.)From this lime their name disappears from history,and is not even found among the nations of Italythat took up anus in the Social War. But the"Sallentinus ager" continued to be a recognisedterm, and the people are spoken of both by Pliny andSlraho as distinct from their neighbour* theCalabri.(Stnib. vi. p. 277; Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Ptol. iii. 1. §13; Mel. ii. 4; Cic. pro Hose. Am. 46.) The"regio Salentina" is even mentioned a.s a distinctportion of Calabria as late as the time of the Lom­bards. (P. Diac. But. Lang. ii. 21.) The physical character and topography of thecountry of the Salentines arc given in the articleCalabiua. The following towns arc assigned byPliny to tlie Salentines, as distinguished from theCalabrians, strictly so called: Alktium, Barta,Nekktum, Uxextum, and Vkbktum. All theseare situated in the extreme southern end of thelapygian peninsula. The list given by Ptolemynearly agrees with that of Plinv; but he addsKhndiae, which was considerably further X., and isreckoned on good authority a Calabrian city [Rhu-DIAe]. The place he calls Banota is probably theBast a of Pliny. To these inland towns may proba­bly be added the seaports of Calljpolis, CastbumJIi.NEitVAi:, and perhaps Hydkintim also, though the hist seems to have early Rcnvd % Cti»»fccolony. But it is probable that at an earii#T pr. 4the territory of the Salentines was m^.t- ■more extensive.

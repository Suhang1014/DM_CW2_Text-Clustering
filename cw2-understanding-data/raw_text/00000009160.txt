They, however, did notuin Vang, being expelled and put to the sword byt neighbouring barbarians, whom Diodorus by ar.arkable anachronism calls Bruttians, apparentlyInn a few years of their establishment.

TRAGU'RIUM (Tftxyovptor, Strab., Ptol.; Tpa-yipior, Polyb.), an important town of Dalmatia,situated upon an island, which was separated fromthe mainland by an artificial canal. According tothe Antonine Itinerary, it was distant 16 miles fromPraelorium and 13 from Salons*. Pliny calls it44 Tragnrium rivium Ilomanorum," and says that itwas celebrated for its marble. Its name is preservedin tho modem Trim. (Polyb. xxxii. 18 ; Strab. ii.p. 124, vii. p. 315; Ptol. ii. 17. § 14; Plin. iii. 22.s. 26; Mela, ii. 3; //. At.: p. 272; Tub. Peut.;Geogr. Rav. iv. 16.)

The Cilician city of Se-linus also for a time bore the name of Trajanopnlis.[Seuscs.] [L. S.] TRAJANO'POLIS (TpaIo»owoAn), an importanttown in the S. of Thrace, which was probably foundedby or in honour of the emperor Trajan, about tbetime when Plolinopolis was founded, to perpetuatethe name of his wife Plotina. Its exact site appearsto be somewhat doubtful. Some authorities describeit as situated on the right bank of the Hebrus, nearthe pass in the range of Mount Rhodope, throughwhich that river flows, and about 40 miles from itsmouth. Now this is the site of the modem Ori-khova, with which accordingly it is by some identi­fied. It would be difficult, however, to reconcile thiswith the various distances given in the Itineraries:e. g. Trajanopolis is stated to be 9000 pices fromTempyra, and 29,000 from Cypsela; whereas thesite above mentioned is nearly equidistant from thoseassigned to Tempyra and Cypaela, being, howerer,more distant from the former. Bnt this is only on*example out of many showing how extremely imper­fect is our knowledge of the geography of Thrace,both ancient and modem. In the map of the Society 4 I 2

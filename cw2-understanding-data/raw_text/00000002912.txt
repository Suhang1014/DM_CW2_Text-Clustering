He also sent fifty talents of gold for the making of largebasons, and vials, and cups, and an immense quantity of preciousstones. He also gave orders to those who had the custody of thechest that contained these stones, to give the artificers leave tochoose out what sorts of them they pleased. He withal appointed,that a hundred talents in money should be sent to the temple,for sacrifices, and for other uses.

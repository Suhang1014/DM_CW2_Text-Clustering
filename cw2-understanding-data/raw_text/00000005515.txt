[2] Dion Caffius, 1. lxxvi. p. 1284. {5] About the year 186, M. de Tilhimont ismiserably embarrassed with a passage of Dion, inwhich the empress Faustina, who died in the year1-5, is introduced as having contributed to the rhar-riage ofSeverus and Julia (I. lxxiv. p. 124.3.). Thelearned compiler forgot, that Dion is relating, not areal fact, but a dream of Severus; and dreams arecircumscribed to no limits of rime or space.

In theCalcdoaiaawar, the son of Severus was known only by the ap­pellation of Antoninus; and it may seem strange,that the Highland bard should describe him by anick-name, invented four years afterwards, scarcelynsed by the Romans till after the death of that em­peror, and seldom employed by the most ancienthistorians.

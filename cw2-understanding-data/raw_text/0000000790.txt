OCR Output THE DECLINE AND FALL are contained in it. The twenty-third chapter of theoriginal, like the twentieth, is accordingly abridged ;butthe points which are retained are given, without anyaddition, in the language of Mr. Gibbon. I havecarefully avoided the omission or alteration of a singleword in that point of the narrative which relates tothe remarkable circumstances that attended the at足tempt of Julian to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem.I think it will be satisfactory to observe, in respect toAmmianus Marcellinus, as was noticed in the formercase of Tacitus, how little is the amount of all thatcan be urged by the ingenuity of our author, to lessenthe weight of the evidence which is derived to Chris足tianity from the testimony of the two great paganhistorians.

But that I may not be ac足cused of a partial or imperfect quotation, I shall in足sert the whole of the first page of the twenty-thirdBook of Ammianus Marcellinus: "Haec eo anno, ut"prretereamus negotiorum minutias, agebantur per"provincias: Julianus vero jam ter consule ascito in"collegio trabeae Sallustio praefecto perGallias, qua-"ter ipse amplissimum inierat magistratum: et vide"batur novum adjunctum esse Augusto privatum,"quod post Diocletianum et Aristobulum nullus me-"minerat gestum.

[Book IV. of allowable and non-allowable actions; whose grammarand jurisprudence, moreover, urgently required a methodicaltreatment, without possessing the ability to develop such atreatment of themselves. So this philosophy thoroughlyincorporated itself, as a plant borrowed no doubt fromabroad but acclimatized in Italian soil, with the Romannational economy, and we meet its traces in the mostdiversified spheres of action. Its earliest appearance beyonddoubt goes further back; but the Stoa was first raised tofull influence in the higher ranks of Roman society bymeans of the group which gathered round Scipio jEmilianus.Panaetius of Rhodes, the instructor of Scipio and of allScipio's intimate friends in the Stoical philosophy, who wasconstantly in his train and usually attended him even onjourneys, knew how to adapt the system to clever men ofthe world, to keep its speculative side in the background,and to mitigate in some measure the dryness of the ter­minology and the insipidity of its moral catechism, moreparticularly by the aid of the earlier philosophers, amongwhom Scipio himself had an especial predilection for theSocrates of Xenophon.

But infinitely moreimportant was the new state-philosophy and state-religion,which emanated from the blending of the Stoic philosophyand the Roman religion. The speculative element, fromthe first impressed with but little energy on the system ofZeno and still further weakened when that system foundadmission to Rome,—after the Greek schoolmasters hadalready for a century been busily driving this philosophyinto boys' heads and thereby driving the spirit out of it,—fell completely into the shade in Rome, where nobodyspeculated but the money-changers; little further was saidas to the ideal development of the God ruling in the soulof man, or of the divine law of the world. The Stoicalphilosophers showed themselves not insensible to the verylucrative distinction of seeing their system raised into thesemi-official Roman state-philosophy, and proved altogether

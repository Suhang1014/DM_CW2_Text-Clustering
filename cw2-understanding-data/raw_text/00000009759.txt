He only once married. The Dean never was a stipendiary curate. The moment hewas ordained a Priest, he became a Rector; and enjoyed everafter an income which far exceeded his expenses. An enemyto ostentatious legacies, he bequeathed the chief of his fortune,which was very considerable, to his widow and his nephew,for he had no children. He gave one hundred pounds to theChester Infirmary, and one hundred pounds to the fund forwidows of clergymen in the archdeaconry of Chester: thesehe esteemed useful charities.

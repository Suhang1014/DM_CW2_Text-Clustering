The theory of Bunsen necessarilyrests on the assumption of a different line of wallfrom that laid down in the preceding account; andits another line is also adopted by Niehuhr (Hist. i.p. 397, Ethnogr. ii. p. 49), it will be necessary toexamine this point before proceeding to the questionof the pate. Niebuhr and Bunsen are, however, farfrom coinciding. The line drawn by the formerproceeds along the banks of the river; that drawnby the latter runs from the Porta Carmentalis tothe X. angle of the Circus Mazimus, and, adopt­ing the NW. front of the circus, or what wascalled the Oppidum, as part of the line, pro­ceeds onwards to the Aventine, thus shutting thegreater part of the Forum Boarium out of the city.Both these theories, however, agree in so faraa theyassume an enceinte continue, or continued line ofwall; and therefore, if this notion can be shown tobe false, both tall to the ground. Now it can beproved on the very best evidence that there was nowall in this part of the city, which was defendedsolely by the Tiber. We have already adduced ap;tosage from Dionysius in confirmation of thisstatement; and the same author in another passagerepeats the same thing in so plain a manner thatthere can be no reasonable doubt of the fact:i6trj<rtv i) w6\ts dKwvou Kara Kpdros ftTei^iffrosoh<ra 4k 7wv irapa tov vora/jbv ntpwv (v. '23).Hut Dionysius does not stand alone. We haveLivy also as a voucher for the same fact, who, innarrating the enterprise of Porsena against Rome,observe* that the citizens regarded some parls oftheir city as secured by the wall, arid other parts bythe Tit»er: "Alia nmris, aha Tiberi objecto videbanturtuta (ii. 10). The same fact appears, though notin so direct a manner, from the same author's ac­count of the procession of the virgins from thetemple of Apollo, outside the Carmental gate, to thatof Juno Kegina on the Aventine, to which we havebefore briefly alluded. The route is described asfollows; "A porta (Carmentali) Jugario vico inforum ventre. Inde vico Tusco Velabroque perBoarium forum in clivum Public!um atque aedemJunonis Reginae perrectum" (xxvii. 37). Now thesmall space allotted by Bunsen to the Forum Boa­rium must have been inside of the wall, since thetemples of Fortune and Mater Matuta, which stoodiij>on it (Liv, xxxiii. 27), were within the PortaCarmentalis (Id. xxv. 7). The procession, then,after passing through that forum, must have goneout of the city at another gate,— Bunsen's Flumen-tana,—and have entered it again by the Trigemiua,before it could reach the CHvua Publicius, —facts which are not mentioned by Livy in his verypreckse description of the route. Having thus shown on the best evidence that nowall ox.i-.ted at this point, it would be a mere wasteof time to refute arguments intended to show thatit possibly might have existed,—such as whether awall with a gate would keep out an inundation,whether tin* Fabii went over the Sublician bridge,and others of the like sort, which would have puz-zled an ancient harnspex. We will therefore pro­ceed to examine Becker's hypothesis, that the PortaTriumphalis was, in fact, no gate at all. but merelyan arch in the Campus Martins, a theory which isal.Mj adopted, though with some little variation, byPreller (Regimen, p. 162, and Anhang, p. 239). Becker places this arch at the s^-ot where theCampus Martius joins the Kegio called Circus F la mini 01, and takes it to be the same tUt *ss t»-built by Domitian (of cuur>e he must mean rW>«Jr,though it is not very clearly expressed. I*. J/rn.p. 92, Ilandb. p. 153). His conjecture fcuvuon the following lines in a poem of Minimi? {rs±65) in which lie describes the erection Uu»and of some other buildings near it: — "Haec est digna tuis, Gennaruee. forli trHos aditus urbem Marti> habere dec*!.* Becker, however, is totally unable to prove last'.a*arch and the temple of Fort una Kedux near rt «r«even in the Campus Martins at ail. Ihus he(Ilandb. p. 642): " It is not indeed exprewif s*.that the Ara of Fortuna Ret hi x was in thr Cits-Martins; but it bt comes /m>b<dile from tbe enr»Btance that Domitian built here. and. u b«tconjectured at p. 153, close to the Porta Tnuafskaa.a temple to the same goddess." The ir^then proceeds as follows: "We hu<te t'nci Uar^Kthat Domitian built a temple to Fortuna l*anw here her altar formerly stood, and also a trmca**arch near it.

There is, however, another palace of Ma-aaeither overlooked or ignored by Berker. whica feaavery strongly to show that this arrh of lx«£iaireally was in the Campus Marti us, but at yis* idifferent spot from that so conveniently fcx&i ssflby him. It is the following (x. 6) : — "Felices qui bus urna dedit ^r^<■Solibus Arctois sideribuv^ue duec.ii.Quando erit illc dies quo Campus et arf*x e* omnis Lucebit Latia culta fenestra mini?Quando morae dukes, longus^ue a Caeaavpulvis, Tutaque Flaminia Roma, videuda. via?* There can be no doubt that these lines refer tollsame triumphal entry of Domitian's as t}m»tby Becker; and they pretty plainly thnw, m t\nina, without any view to tl»e presentjustly observes (/udirazione. <fc. p. 43T\ tin 'Iarch and other monuments stood on the Vu Fallnia, and therefore at a very constderabWfrom the spot assigned to tl»ein by Becker.

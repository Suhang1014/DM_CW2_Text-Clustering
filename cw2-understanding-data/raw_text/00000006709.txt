OCR Output B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 361 patrole assigned for Munichia; and, what was of mostimportance, it was openly countenanced by the wholebody of the heavy-armed. The news of it was imme­diately carried to the four hundred, who were this mo­ment assembled together in council; and all, except­ing those dissatisfied with their measures, were ready torun to arms, and vented terrible threats against Thera-menes and his associates. But he, apologizing for himself, declared his readi­ness to take up arms along with them, and attend themto the rescue of Alexicles; and, taking with him oneof the generals who was in his secret, he hurried downto the Piræus. Aristarchus also ran down to assist; asdid, farther, the young men belonging to the cavalryof the State. Great, in truth, was the tumult, and full of horror:For those who were left in the upper-city imagined thatthe Piræus was already seized, and that Alexicles was/lain; and they in the Piræus each moment expected anassault from those in the city. Not without difficultycould the men of years and experience stop such as werewildly running up and down the streets, and rushingto arms. And Thucydides, the Pharsalian, public hostof the State, who happened then to be at Athens, threwhimself with lively zeal in the way ot all who were flock­ing down; conjuring them earnestly " not to finishf' the ruin of their country, when the enemy lay so"near to strike the blow." But thus, at length, theirfury abated, and the effusion of one another's blood wasprevented. As for Theramenes, he was no sooner got down tothe Piræus, than, assuming authority, (for he himselfwas at this time a general,) he pretended to rate theheavy-armed for this piece of mutiny, at least so far asmere making a noise could do it; whilst Aristarchus andall the opposite faction were angry with them in earnest.But the bulk of the heavy-armed drew together in abody, and betray no sign of regret for what they had done.

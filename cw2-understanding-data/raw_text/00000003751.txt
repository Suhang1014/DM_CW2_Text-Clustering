Now as to Hades, wherein the souls of the righteousand unrighteous are detained, it is necessary to speak of it.Hades is a place in the world not regularly finished; asubterraneous region, wherein the light of this world doesnot shine; from which circumstance, that in this region thelight does not shine, it cannot but be there must be in it per­petual darkness. This region is allotted as a place of custodyfor souls, in which angels are appointed as guardians to them,who distribute to them temporary putiishments, agreeable toevery one's behavior and manners. 2. In this region there is a certain place set apart as alake of unquenchable fire; whereinto we suppose no one hathhitherto been cast; but it is prepared for a day afore-determined by God, in which one righteous sentence shalldeservedly be passed upon all men; when the unjust, andthose that have been disobedient to God, and have givenhonor to such idols as have been the vain operations of thehands of men as to God himself, shall be adjudged to thiseverlasting punishment, as having been the causes of defile­ment; while the just shall obtain an incorruptible and never-fading kingdom. These are now, indeed, confiued in Hades,but not in the same place wherein the unjust are confined. (450)

In this camp, the Albans lost their leader Cluilius;and for his successor in the command, chose MettusFutTetiu?. In the mean time, Tullus, naturally brave,and animated still more by the death of Cluilius, gaveout, that the great God of heaven, having already be­gun at the head, would not stop there, but take ven-ptanco on the whole Alban nation, as the authors of thisunjust war.

Horace mentinns(S'it. i. 3. 12) that tlie singer Tigellius had some­times as ninny as 200 slaves; but when he wastaken with a sudden fit of economy, he reducedthem to the very modest number of 10. No doubt,however, he was a first-rate vocalist, and, like hisbrethren in modern times, a man of fortune. Til-lius the praetor, who was a stingy churl, when bewent to Tibur, had 5 slaves at Ins heels to carryhis cooking utensils and wine. (fb. i. 6. 107.)Horace himself, who of course was not so rich a manas Tigellius, when be sat down to his frugal supperof cakes and vegetables, was waited upon by 3slaves; and we may presume that these did notcompose his entire household. {Ib. v. 115.) Inthe reign of Nero, 400 slaves were maintained inthe palace of Pedanius Secundus, who were all putt'i death, women and children included, because onetit' them had murdered his master. (Tnc. Ann. xiv.42. seu.) The slaves no longer consisted of those bornand bred on the estates of their masters, but wereimported in multitudes from all the various nationsunder the wide-spread dominion of the Romans.(*' Pustquam vero nationes in familiis habemus,quibus diversi ritus, externa sacra, aut nulla sunt,colluviem istam non nisi metu coercueris." {lh. c44.) The ease of Pedanius, however, was no doubtan extraordinary one. It cannot be imagined thatthe plehs urbana, who received the public rations,were capable of maintaining slaves; nor probablyare many to be assigned to the aliens. But if weplace the patrician and equestrian families at 15,000,and allow the moderate average number of 30 slavesto each family, this would give a total number of450,000. Some also must l>e allowed to the richerpart of tin* plebt—to persons who, like Horace, werenot patrician nor equestrian, yet could afford to keepa few slaves; as well as to the aliens resident atRome, so that we can hardly compute the numberiif domestic slaves at less than 500,000. To thesemust he added the public slaves at the disposal ofthe various municipal officers, also those employedin handicraft trades and manufactures, as journey­men carpenters, builders, masons, bakers, and thelike. It would not perhaps be too much to estimatethese at 300,000, thus making the total slave popu­lation of Rome 800,000, This sum, added to that ofthe free inhabitants, would give a total of 2,045,1)00. The Xotitia and Curiosum state the number ofinmlae at Rome at 46,602, and the number ofthimus at 1790, besides balnsa, lupanaria, mili­tary and police stations, &c. If we had any meansof ascertaining the average number of inhabitants ineach insula, it would afford a valuable mettled ofcheeking the preceding computation. But hereagain we are unfortunately reduced to uncertaintyand conjecture. We may, however, pretty surelyinfer that each insula contained a large number ofinmates. In the time of Augustus the yearly rentnf the coenaeula of an insula ordinarily produced40,000 sesterces, or between 300/. and 400/. sterling.(ftig. H»- til- 2. s. 30, a p. Gibbon, eh. 31,note 70.)Petronius (c. 95, 97), and Juvenal (Sat. hi. passim)describe the crowded state of these lodgings. If wetake them at an average of four stories, each accom­modating 12 or 13 persons, this would give say 50persons in each insula; and even then the inmates,men,women and boys, would be paying an average yearlyrent uf about per head. The inmates of eachdomits can hardly be set down at less, since the family, with tutors and other hangers <*. tmy pe>haps be fairly estimated at 10, and tlie >]y.r% aeach domus at 40.

Vrtaking the mtuiac actually inhabited at 40,000—since some must have been to let, or under repi? —and the inhabited domus at 1500 s41,500,aah»number of inmates in each at 50. we thoaai aawa total population of 2,075,000, a sum not pwwat variance with the amount obtained bj \U y*~vious method.

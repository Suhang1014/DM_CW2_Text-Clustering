Book X. the king, and to the multitude, by whom he threatened thevery same calamities to them, which their brethren the Israel­ites, upon the like affronts offered to God, were now under.But these men would not believe their words, by which belietthey might have reaped the advantage of escaping all those mi­series, yet did they in earnest learn that what the prophets hadtold them was true. 2. And when they persevered in the same course of life, Godraised up war against them, from the king of Babylon and Chaldea, who sent an army against Judea, and laid waste the country; and caught king Manasseh by treachery, and ordered hinto be brought to him, and had him under his power to inflic"what punishment he pleased upon him. But then it was thatManasseh perceived what a miserable condition he was in, andesteeming himself the cause of all, he besought God to renderhis enemy humane and merciful to him. Accordingly, Godheard his prayer, and granted him what he prayed for. So Ma­nasseh was released by the king of Babylon, and escaped the dan­ger he was in: And when he was come to Jerusalem, he en­deavoured, if it were possible, to cast out of his memory thosehis former sins against God, of which he now repented, and toapply himself to a very religious life. He sanctified the temple,and purged the city, and for the remainder of his days he was'intent on nothing but to return his thanks to God for his de­liverance, and to preserve him propitious to him all his lifelong.He also instructed the multitude to do the same, as having verynearly experienced what a calamity he was fallen into by a con­trary conduct. He also rebuilt the altar, and offered the legalsacrifices, as Moses commanded. And when he had re-establish­ed what concerned the divine worship, as it ought to be, he tookcare of the security of Jerusalem: he did not only repair theold walls with great diligence, but added another wall to theformer. He also built very lofty towers, and the garrisonedplaces before the city he strengthened, not only in other respectsbut with provisions of all sorts that they wanted. And indeedwhen he had changed his former course, he so led his life fo»the time to come, that from the time of his return to piety to­wards God, he was deemed a happy man, and a pattern foi.mitation: when therefore he had lived sixty-seven years, hedeparted this life, having reigned fifty-five years, and was buriedin his own garden; and the kingdom came to his son Amon,whose mother's name was Meshumeleth, of the city of Jobath.

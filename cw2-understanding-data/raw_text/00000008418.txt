(/(. Ant. p. 243; Ptol. o § 5; Sot.t. Imp.; Tub. Petit., where it isarilteB Tittoburgium.) The name seems toutt thai it was originally a settlement of the Teutones, which may hare been founded at the timewhen they roamed over those countries, aboutB. c. 113. No remains are now extant, and itsexact site is only matter of conjecture. (Muchar,A'orikum, vol. i. p. 265.) [L. S.] TEUTOBERGIENSIS SALTUS, a mountainforest in Western Germany, where in a.d. 9 theRoman legions under Varus suffered the memorabledefeat, and where, six years later, their uiiburiedremains were found by Drusns. (Tac. Ann. i. 60.)A general description of the locality without themention of the name is found in Dion Cassins(Ivi. 20, 21; comp. Veil. Pat. ii. 105, 118, foil.).This locality has in modem times been the subjectof much discussion among German antiquaries;but the words of Tacitus seem to imply clearly thathe was thinking of the range of hills between thesources of the I.upia and Amasis; that is, the rangebetween Lippspringe and llawtenbeck. (Giefers,Be Alisone Cattelio deque Varianae CUulu LocoCommentatio. p. 47, foil ) [L. S.] TEUTONES or TEUTONI (T.iW.j), thename of a powerful Gennan tribe, which aboutB. C. 113 appeared on the frontiers of Gaul at theBame time when the Cimbri, probably a Celtic people,after defeating the Romans in several battles,traversed Gaul and invaded Spain. The Teutones,however, remained behiud ravaging Gaul, and werejoined by the Ombrones. At length, in u. c 102,they were defeated by C. Marius in a great battlenear Aquae Scxtiae, where, according to the mostmoderate accounts, 100,000 of them were slain,while SO.000 or 90,000 are said to have been takenprisoners. A body of 6000 men, who survived thatterrible day, are said to have established themselvesin Gaul between the Maat and Schelde, where theybecame the ancestors of the Adualici. (Liv. EpiLlib. Ixvii.; Veil. Pat. ii. 12; Hor. iii. 3; I'lut.Mar. 36, foil.; Oros. v. 16; Caes. B. G. ii. 4, 29.)After this great defeat, the Teutones are for a longtime not heard of in history, while during thepreceding t n years they are described as wanderingabout the Up]#r Rhine, and eastward even as faras Pannonia. In later times a tribe bearing thename of Teutones is mentioned by Pomp. Mela(iii. 3),Pliny (xxxvii. 11), and Ptolemy (ii. ll.§17)as inhabiting a district in tho north-west of Ger­many, on the north of the river Albis, whereaccording to Pliny, they dwelt even as early aathe time of Pvtheas of Ma&silia. Tlie questionhere naturally presents itself whether these Teutonesin the north of Germany were the same as thosewho in the lime of Marius invaded Gaul in con­junction with the Cimbri, who in fact came fromthe same quarters. This question must be an­swered in the affirmative; or in other words, thoTeutones who appeared in the south were a branchof those in the north-west of Germany, havingbeen induced to migrate southward either by inun­dations or other calamities. The numerous body ofemigrants bo much reduced the number of lh<«eremaining behind, that thereafter they were a tribeof no great importance. That the name of Teutoneswas never employed, either by the Germans thenuselves or by the Romans, as a general name for tbewhole German nation, has already been explained illthe article Gekmania. Some writers even regard theTeutones as not Germans at all, but either as Sla­vonians or Celts. (Latham, Epileg. ad Tac. Germ.p. ex.) The fact that the country between the lowerElbe and tlie Baltic was once inhabited by the

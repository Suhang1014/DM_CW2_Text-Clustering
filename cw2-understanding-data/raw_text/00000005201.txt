OCR Output NOTES ON THE T [iJTTOPISCUS in Hist. August, p. 222. V Aurelius Victor mentions a formal de­putation from the troops to the senate. [2] Vopiscus, our principal authority, wroteat Rome, sixteen years only after the death of Au-relian; and besides the recent notoriety of the facts,constantly draws his materials from the Journals ofthe Senate, and the original papers of the Ulpianlibrary. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorantof this transaction- a* they were ia general of theRoman constitution. [j] Liv. i. 17. Dionys. Halicarn. 1. ii. p. 115.Plutarch in Numa, p. 60. The first of these writersrelates the story like an orator, the second like alawyer, and the third like a moralist, and none ofthem probably without some intermixture of sable. [4] Vopiscus (in Hist. August, p. 227.) calls him'primæ sententi e consuLu is;' and soon afterwards,frinapsfinatus. It is natural to suppose, that themonarchs of Rome, disdaining that humble title,resigned it to the most ancient of the senators. [5] The only objection to this genealogy, is thatthe historian was named Cornelius, the emperor,Claudius. But under the lower empire, surnameswere extremely various and uncertain. [6] Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 637. The AlexandrianChronicle, by an obvious mistake, transfers thatage to Aurelian. [7] In the year 273, he was ordinary consul.But he must have been SufFectus many years before,and most probably under Valerian. [8] Bit millies oBingcntitt. Vopiscus in Hist.August, p. 229. This sum, according to the oldstandard, was equivalent to eight hundred and fortythousand Roman pounds of silver, each of the valueof three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus,the coin had lost much of its weight and purity. [9] After his accession, he gave orders that tencopies of the historian should be annually transcrib­ed and placed in the public libraries. The Romanlibraries have long since perished, and tho mostvaluable part of Tacitus was preserved in a singleMS. and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. WELFTH CHAPTER. See Bayle, Dictionaire, Art. 7W//,'and Lipsius ziAnnal. ii. 9. [10] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 227. [n] Hist. August, p. 228. Tacitus addressed thePrætorians by the appellation of sandijjimi milites,and the people by that ofsacratijjimi S^irites. [12] In his manumissions he never exceeded thenumber of an hundred, as limited by the Caninianlaw, which was enacted under Augustus, and atlength repealed by Justinian. See Casaubon ad locumVopisci. [13] See the lives of Tacitus, Florianus, andProbus, in the Augustan History; we may be wellassured, that whatever the soldier gave, the senatorhad already given. [14] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 216. Thepas-sage is perfectly clear; yet both Casaubon and Sal-masius wish to correct it. [15] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 230. 232, 233.The senators celebrated the happy restoration with-hecatombs and public rejoicings. [16] Hist. August, p. 228. [17] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 230. Zosimus,l.i. p. 57. Zonaras, l.xii. p. 637. Two passagesin the life of Probus (p. 236. 238.) convince me,that these. Scythian invaders of Pontus were Alani.IT we may believe Zosimus (I. i. p. ;8.) Florianuspursued them as far as the Cimmerian Bosphorus;But he had scarcely time for so long and difficult anexpedition. [18] Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only fay thathe died; Victor junior adds, that it was of afever. Zosimus and Zonaras affirm, that he waskilled by the soldiers. Vopiscus mentions both ac­counts, and seems to hesitate. Yet surely thesejarring opinions are easily reconciled. [19] According to the two Victors, he reignedexactly two hundred days. [20] Hist.

As these stations were necessarilyne:u- the borders of Regions, we find them frequentlymentioned in the Notitin and Curiotum. Theyseem to have been a sort of barracks. But besidesthe 7 principal stations, the Breviarium mentions14 excubitoria, or outposts, which seem to have beenplaced in the middle of each region. The corps ofwhich they were composed were probably suppliedfrom the main stations. The duties of the visileswere those of a night-police, namely, to guard againstfires, burglaries, highway robberies, &c. The firstof these duties had anciently been performed bycertain triumviri, called from their functions Noe-turni, who were assisted by public slaves stationedat the sates and round the walls. The same officewas, however, sometimes assumed by the aedilesand tribunes of the people. (Paulus, I. c.) Thevigilcs were provided with alt the anns and toolsnecessary for their duties: and from a passage inlYtronius (c. 79) seem to have possessed the ]*>wer<if breaking into houses when they suspected anydanger. The numbers of the vigiles amounted atliLst to 70<>0 men. or 1000 in each cohort. Augustusalso established the Cohortes Praetoriae, or imperialguard, of whicli 9 cohorts were disposed in theneighbourhood of Rome, and 3 only, the Cohort esCrbanae, were permitted within the city. (Tac. Aim.iv. ft; Suet. Aug. 49.) These cohorts of Augustuswere under the command of the Praefectus Urbi.(Tac. Hist, iii. 04.) It was his successor, Tiberius,who, by the advice of S-janus, first established aregular Praetorian camp at Koine, a little to theeastward of the agger of Servius, and placed thebands under tlw command of a Praefectus Praetorio.v lac. Ann. iv. 2; Suet. Tib. 37.) Augustus also paid considerable attention to themethod of building, and revived the regulations laiddown by P, Rut i lias Kufus with regard to this sub­ject in the time of the Gracchi (Suet. Aug.B9); butall we know of these regulations is, that Augustusforbade houses to be built higher than 70 feet, ifsituated in a street. (Strab. v. p, 235.) Theheight was subsequently regulated by Nero andTrajan. i!ie last of whom fixed it at CO feet. (Aur.Vict.

Auburn R„mc — Strabo, who visited Rome inthe reign «t Augustus, and must have remainedthere during part of that of Tiberius, has left usthe following Uvelv picture of itsthat period: The city, having thusa sise, is able to maintain of wood and stone for building, which tLf ce-stant fires and continual falling and pulungof houses render necessary; for even pu.ii.sg c*»iand rebuilding in order to gratify the taste a m:a sort of voluntary ruin. Moreover the a«i*.£aimines and forests, and the rivers which sen* »convey materials, afford wonderful rowans for itempurposes. Such is the Anio, flowing d<*wn frrc Km(Fucensis), a Latin city lying towards the term mof the Marsians, and so through the ;.. -into the Tiber: also the Nar and tin; Te!*a »::likewise join the Tiber after flowing tliraigii L a-bria; and tlie Clan is, which waters Eir^r-a aa; caterritory of Clusium.

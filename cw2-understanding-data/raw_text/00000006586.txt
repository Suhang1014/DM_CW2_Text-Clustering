THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 231 the annoyance which Decelea, now fortified, gave them,the Athenians were arrived before Syracuse with ano­ther armament as great and as formidable as the for­mer *, and that, in every view, the strength of Athensmust be quite unsurmountable. And now also the A-thenians, who remained of the former armament, re­spired from that dejection of spirit into which a series ofmisfortunes had plunged them.

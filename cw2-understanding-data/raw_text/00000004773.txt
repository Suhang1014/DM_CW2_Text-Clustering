Flaminius, one of the consuls elect, to whom hadfallen by lot the legions which wintered at Placentia,sent an edict and letter to the consul, desiring thatthose troops should be ready in camp at Ariminum onthe ides of March. His design was to enter on theoffice of consul in his province ; for he rememberedhis old disputes with the patricians, the contests inwhich he had engaged with them when tribune of thecommons, and afterwards, when consul, first about theconsulship, his election to which they wanted to annul,and then about a triumph. He was besides hated bythe patricians on account of a new law, prejudicial tothe senators, introduced by Caius Claudius, a plebeiantribune, to which Caius Flaminius alone, of all the pa­tricians, had given his support, that no senator, or sonof a senator, should be owner of a ship fit for sea-voyages, which contained more than three hundredamphoras.1 This size was thought sufficient for con­veying the produce of their farms, and every kind oftraffic was deemed unbecoming a senator. This busi­ness had been contested with the utmost degree of heat,and had procured to Flaminius, the advocate for thelaw, great hatred among the nobility, but as great popu­larity among the commons, and, in consequence ofthis, a second consulship.

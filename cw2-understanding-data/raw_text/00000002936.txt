He went thence to Tyre, and was therecaught; and when he had suffered much from his enemies beforehis death, he was slain by them. So Alexander took the king­dom, and made a league with Hyrcanus, who yet, when he af­terward fought with Antiochus the son of Demetrius, who wascalled Grypus, was also beaten in the fight, and slain. CHAP.'X. How, upon the quarrel between Antiochus Grypus, and AntiochusCyzicenus, about the kingdom, Hyrcanus took Samaria, andutterly demolished it, - and how Hyrcanus joined himself to thesect of the Sadducees, and left that of the Pharisees. § 1. \VHEN Antiochus had taken the kingdom, he was a-fraid to make war against Judea, because he heard that his bro­ther, by the same mother, who was also called Antiochus, wasraising an army against him out cf Cyzicum, so he staid in hisown land, and resolved to prepare himself for the attack he ex­pected from his brother, who was called Cyzicenus, because hehad been brought up in that city. He was the son of Antiochusthat was called Soter, who died in Parthia. He was the bro­ther of Demetrius, the father of Grypus, for it had so happened,that one and the same Cleopatra was married to two, who werebrethren, as we have related elsewhere.

Now Hyrcanus lived all this while in peace; for afterthe death of Antiochus, he * revolted from the Macedonians,nor did he any longer pay them the least regard, either as theirsubject or their friend, but his affairs were in a very improvingand flourishing condition in the times of Alexander Zebina, andespecially under these brethren, for the war which they hadwith one another gave Hyrcanus the opportunity of enjoyinghimself in Judea quietly, insomuch that he got an immensequantity of money. However, when Antiochus Cyzicenus dis­tressed his land, he then openly showed what he meant. Andwhen he saw that Antiochus was destitute of Egyptian auxiliaries,and that both he and his brother were in an ill condition in thestruggles they had with one another, he despised them both. 2. So he made an expedition against Samaria, which was avery strong city; of whose present name Sebaste, and its re­building by Herod, we shall speak at a proper time: but he made * Dean Prideaux lakes notice at the year 130, that Justin, in agreement withJosephus, says, "The power of the Jews was now grown so great, that after this"Antiochus, they woutd not bear any Macedonian king over them, and that they"Se't up a government of their own, and infested Syria with groat wars."

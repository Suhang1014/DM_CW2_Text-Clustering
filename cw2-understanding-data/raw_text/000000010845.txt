OCR Output ROMAN HISTORY. 429 * unsolicited, to the demand of my .son, and the request'which I add in his favour. His request was granteJwithout difficulty; snd his son,P. Licinius, was returned military tribune with consularpower, together with those whom we have mentionedabove. Titjnius and Genucius, military tribuoes, march­ed against the Falisci and Capenates, and acting withgrealer bravery than prudence, fell headlong into anambuscade. ^Genucius paid dear for his temerity, for hewas killed fighting valiantly at the head of his troops.Titinius rallied his men, after they had recovered fromtheir fright, and having gained an eminence, drew themup again in order of battle; but he took care not to riskanother engagement upon fair ground. The disgrace was greater than all the loss they sus­tained, which, however, in the consequesce was nearproving a total defeat, such was the consternation, notonly at Rome, where fame had exaggerated every cir­cumstance, but also in the camp before Veii. For a re­port having been circulated all over the-camp, that thevictorious Capenates and Falisci had cut off the Roman,troops with both their generals, and were in full marchand at no great distance, with all the Etrurian youth forVeil, it was with much difficulty the soldiers coutd beprevented from flying outright. The alarm was still,greater at Rome, f»r there they weje persuaded- thai thecamp at Veil was already attacked, and part of the ene­my in full march to attack the city. The citizens flewto the ramparts-, and the ladies, whom the general con­sternation had driven put of their houses, offered up sup­plications in the temples, imploring the gods, that if theRomans had by proper rites renewed the neglected cere­monies, if the prodigies had been duly expiated, theywould protect the temples, houses, and walls of Romefrom destruction, and turn all fhe present terror againstVeii.

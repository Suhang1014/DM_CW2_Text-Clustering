Cato touched atthis point in Africa after leaving Crete, but thenatives refused to receive his ships. (Lucan, ix.40.) Synesius, who has given in his letters (A'p.51, 100, 114, 129) several particulars about thisspot, states that it was dangerous to live here becauseof the stagnant waters, and their fetid exhalations.

A.town of Phthiotis in Thessaly, one of the placessubject to Protesilaus, and frequently mentioned inthe Homeric poems. (/£ ii. 695, xiii. 696, xv. 335,Od. xi. 290; comp. Apoll. Khod. i. 45; Steph. B.i v.) It contained a temple of Protesilaus. (I'ind.hthm. i. 84.) Pliny erroneously calls it a town ofMagnesia (iv. 9. s. 16). Strabo describes it asstanding between Pharsalus and Phthiotic Thebes,at the distance of about 100 stadia from the latter(ix. pp. 433, 435). Leake places it at about 40minutes from Ckidek, in the descent from a pass,where there are remains of an ancient town. Thesituation near the entrance of a pass is well suitedto the name of Phylace.

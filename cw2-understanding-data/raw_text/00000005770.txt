With respect to the two temples of Mercufy*one of which is called the temple of Criophoros, or the bearerof the ram, and the other of Pramochos, or the defender,they fay that the first of these was thus denominated, be­cause Mercury freed them from a pestilence, by carryinga ram round the walls; and that on this account Calamismade a statue of Mercury for the Tanagræans, carrying aram on his shoulders.

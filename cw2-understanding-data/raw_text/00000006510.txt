J O N the earliest approach of the spring which led onthe following summer, the Athenians in Sicily, hoist­ing from Catana, shewed themselves on the coast of Me-gara in Sicily, of Which the Syracusans, having dispos­sessed the inhabitants in the time of Gelon, the tyrant,(as I have already related,) continued mailers of thefoil. Having landed here, they ravaged the country;till, approaching a fortress belonging to the Syracusans,and attempting it without success, they retired, someby land and the rest on-board the fleet, into the riverTereas; from whence going again on-shore, they rava­ged the plains and. set fire to the growing corn. Thryalso fell in with a small party of Syracusans, someof whom they flew; and then, erecting a trophy, wentagain on-board. They next returned to Catana; and,aster victualling there, proceeded from thence, withtheir whole force, to the attack of Centoripa, a strongfort belonging to the Siculj j and, having made them­selves masters of it by a capitulation, they stood away,burning down in their passage the corn of the Inesseansand Hybleans. Upon returning to Catana, they findthere two hundred and fifty horiemen arrived from A-thens, though without horses, yet with all the properfurniture, as if they could be better supplied with theformer in Sicily; as also thirty archers, mounted, and•three hundred talents in silver.

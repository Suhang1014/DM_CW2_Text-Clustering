Book I. to one who would be faithful to him, and bare him good-will onaccount of their kindred : he also gave him a secret injunction,that if Antony slew him, he would slay .her. But Joseph, with­out any ill design, and only in order to demonstrate the king'slove to his wife, how he could not bear to think of being separa­ted from her, even by death itself, he discovered this grand se­cret to her ; upon which, when Herod was come back, and asthey talked together, confirmed his love to her by many oaths,and assured her that he had never such an affection for any otherwoman as he had for her.

This temper of theirs increased upon them, as they grew * Here is either a defect, or a great mistake in Josephus's pretest copies, ormemory, for Mariamne did uot i:ow reproach Herod with this his first injunctionto Joseph to k:!l her, if he himself were slain by Antony, but that he had giventhe like command a second time to Soemus alsn, when he was afraid of being slainby Augustus.

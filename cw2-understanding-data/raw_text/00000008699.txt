OCR Output MARSYAS. MARTYROPOLIS. Idrias, that is in the neighbourhood of Stratoniccia,and flowing in a nortu-wi\>terti direction pa>t Ala-banda, discharged its waters into the Maeandernearly opposite to Trallcs. On its banks were the\(VKoi (TTJjAoi, near which the Carians held theirnational meetings. (Herod, v. 118.) The modernname of this river is Tsh'tna, as is clearly provedby Leake {Asia Minor, p. 234, &c); while earliergeographers generally confound this Marsyas withthe Harpasus. 2. A small river of Phrygia, and, like the CarianMarsyas, a tributary of the Maeander. Herodotus(vii 20) calls it a KarappdicTtfS; and according toXcnophon (Anab. i. 2. § 8) its sources were in themarket-place of Celaenae, beluw the acropolis, whereit fell down with a great noise from the rock (Curt,iii. 1.) Tliis perfectly agrees with the term appliedto it by Herodotus; but the description is apparentlyopposed to a statement of Pliny (v. 41), accord­ing to whom the river took its origin in the valleyof Aulocrene, ten miles from Apamea. (Coinp.Strab. xii. p. 578; Max. Tyr. viii. 8.) Strabo,again, states that a hike above Celaenae was thesource of bulb the Maeander and the Marsyas."Comparing these accounts," says Col, Leake(Asia Minor, p. 160), " with Uvy (xxxviii. 38),who probably copied from Polybius, it may be in­ferred that the lake or pool on the summit of amountain which rose above Celaenae was the reputedsource of the Marsyas and Maeander; but that infact the two rivers issued from different parts of themountain below the lake." By this explanation thediihVulty of reconciling the different statements seemsto he removed, for Aulocrene was probably the nameof the lake, which imparted its own name to the plainmentioned by Pliny, The Marsyas joined the Mae­ander a little way below Celaenae. (Comp. Maeax-i»lk; and Hamilton's Researdtes, i. p. 499.) [L.S.] MA US V AS (Ma.'ai'us).a river of Coelesyria, men­tioned only by l'liny (v. 23) as dividing Apameiafrom the tetrarchy of the Xazerini. It was probablythe river mentioned—without its name—by Abulfedaas a tributary of the Orontes, which, rising belowApameia, falls into the lake synonymous with thatcity, and so joins the Orontes. The modern nameYarmttk is given by Pocoeke, who places it in hismap oil the east of the Orontes, (Abulfeda, TabulaSt/riae,ed. Kochler, pp. 151, 152; Pococke,Descrip­tion oj'Ote East, vol. ii. p. 79.) It doubtless gaveits name to Marsyas, a district of S) ria, mentioned byStrabo, who joins it with Ituraea, and defines itssituation by the following notes:—It adjoined theMacra Campus, on its eaat, and had its commence­ment at Laodiceia ad Libanum. Chaleis was, as itwere, an acropolis of the district. This Chaleis isjoined with Heliopolis, as under the power of Ptolemy,son of Mennaeus, who ruled over Marsyas and Itu-raea. (Strab. xvi. pp. 753, 755.) The same geo-L'i apher speaks of Chalcidice ano tov Map-rvov Kadi}-novia(\>. 153), and extends it to the sources of theOrontes, above which was the AiiKccf fictJiXitcos(p. 155), now the Befoul. From these variousnotices it is evident that the Mar.-yas comprehendedthe valley of the Orontes from its rise to Apameia,where it was bounded on the north probably by theriver of the same name. But it extended westwardto the Macra Campus, which bordered on the Medi­terranean. (Mannert, Geographic van Syrien,pp. 326. 363.)

St. Mitfm(Man. snr fAr/nenie, vol. i. p. 57) has ingeniouslyconjectured that the name Spauta lhat is applied li>it in our MSS. of Strabo, is an error of some copynlfor Caputa, a word which answers to the ArmcuunGahoid and Persian Kabud, signifying " blue," a&iwhich, in allusion to the colour of the water, is tt.ttitle usually assigned to it by the Oriental penp*-| phers.

The descriptions art- verbose, and theancient ones being intermingled with the modernhave to be sought through a voluminous work.A still graver detect is the almost entire absence,especially in the earlier volumes, ot all citation ofauthorities. At this period in the history of Roman topographyW. A. Keeker, paid a short visit to Rome.Keeker took up the subject ot* his researches as ajwiint of national honour; anil in his first tract, DtRomae Yeteris Muris atque Portis (Leipzig, 1842),devoted two pages ot the preface to an attack u]*>nCaiiina, whom he suspected of the grave offence of awant of due reverence for German scholarship. Butwith an inborn pugnacity his weaponswerealsoturnedairainst his own countrymen. Amidalittlefaint praise,the labours of Bunsen and Urlichs were censured asincomplete and unsatisfactory. In the following year(1843) Becker published the first vuluinc of his Hand-buck der HOmischen Altert/iumer, containing a viewof the topography of Rome. A review of his workby L. Preller, which appeared in the Neue Je-tuiitsche Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, though writ­ten with candour and moderation, seems to havestung Becker into fury. lie answered it in apamphlet entitled Die Riimischt Topographs infaun, cine Wantung (Leipsig, 1844), in which lieaccused Preller of having taken up the cudgels infavour of Canina, though that gentleman is a mode­rate adherent of the German school of topographers.Nothing can exceed the arrogant tone of this pam­phlet, the very title of which is offensive. U wasanswered by L'rlichs in bis Romische Topographiein Leipzig (Stuttgart, 18-15), in which, thoughKeeker well deserved casligation, the author adoptedtoo much of the virulent and personal tone of hisadversary. The controversy was brought to a closeby a reply and rejoinder, both written with eijualbitterness: but the dispute has served to throwlight on some questions of Roman topography. Ina purely literary point of view, Keeker's I land-hue h must be allowed to be a very useful production,rib views are arranged and stated with great clear­ness, and the constant citation of authorities at thebottom of the page is very convenient to the stu­dent. The writer of this article feels himself boundto acknowledge that it would not have been pos­sible for him to have prepared it without the as­sistance ot Keeker's work. Nevertheless he is ofopinion that many of Keeker's views on the mostimportant points of Roman topography are entirelyerroneous, and that they have gained acceptationonly from the extraordinary confidence with winchthey are asserted and the display of learning bywhich they are supported. Amongst other Ger­man tojographers we need only mention here L.Pivller, who h;ts dune good service by some ablepapers and by his useful work on the Regions ofAugustus (Die Region-en der Stadt Rom, Jena,1840. 8vo.). We may add that the English readerwill find a succinct and able sketch of the views ofthe German school, and particularly of Keeker, in aseries of very valuable papers by Mr. Bunbury, pub­lished in the Classical Museum (vols, iii.iv. and v.). We shall close this list with the names of twomodern Italian topographers. Between the years1820 and 1835.

Nor was it ever restore*!, so asto resume the rank of h town; Pliny tells us that itwas in his time a more village, and the name is notmentioned by any of the other geographers. It is,however, incidentally noticed both by Ovid and Colu­mella (Ovid. Met.xv. 711; Colum. R. R.x. 133), andbeems to have been, in common with the whole coastof the Bay of Naples, a favourite locality for villas.Among others Pomponianns, the friend of the elderPliny, had a villa there, where the great naturalist(sought refuge during the celebrated eruption of Vesu­vius in a. ]>. 79, and where he perished, suffocated bythe cinders and sulphureous fumes (Plin. Ep. vi.16). It is certain that Stabiae was on this occasionburied under the ashes and cinders of the volcano,though le.-s completely than Pompeii and Hercula-neum; but the site was again inhabited, and thename was retained throughout the period of theRoman Empire, though it appears to have neveragain risen into a place of any consideration. It waschiefly resorted to by invalids and others, on accountof its neighbourhood to the Mons Lactarius, for thepurpose of adopting a milk diet (Galen, de Meth.Med. v. 12 ; Cassiod. Vttr, xi. 10; Symmaeh. Ep,vi. 17). Its name is. found also in the Tabula, andwiis preserved in that of Casttll 'a Mare di Stabia,borne by the modern town. The Stabiae of theLower Empire seems to have been situated on thecoast, in the bight of the Bay of Naples; ami pro­bably did not occupy the same site with the oldertown, which seems to have been situated about amile inland at the foot of the hill of Gragnano.The exact spot was forgotten till the remains wereaccidentally brought to light about 1750; Jind sincethat time excavations have been frequently madeon the site, but the results are far less interestingthan those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Theyconfirm the account of Pliny, by showing that therewas no town on the spot, but merely a row ofstraggling villas, mid these for the most part of aninferior class. They seem to have suffered severelyfrom the earthquake of A. T>. 63, which did so muchdamage to Pompeii also. (Swinburne's Travels, vol.i. p 82.) [E. H.B.] STA'BULA, in Gallia, is placed by theAntonineItin. vi. from Cambes (Gros Kembs) and xviii. fromArgentovaria (Artzenheiin). These distances bringus to a place between Otmarsheim and Bautzheim,where Khenanus, quoted by D'Anville, says thattraces of an old place are found. The word Stabula meant a station or resting placefor travellers, a kind of inn, as we sec from a passageof Ulpian {Dig. 47. tit. 5. s. 1): "qui naves, eau-ponas, stabula exercent;" anil the men who keptthe&e places were " Stabularii." [G. L.] STA'BULUM, AD, in Gallia, is placed by theAntonine Itin. between Salsulae (Sokes) and Sum-inus Pyrenaeus, or the pass of the Pyrenees atBellegnrde. It is supposed to be Le Boulu, whichlooks like a part of the old name, on the left bank ofthe Tech. The distances in the Itin. both fromSalsulae to Ad Stabulum, and from Ad Stabulumto Surnmus Pyrenaeus. are a great deal too much.The name, however, and the place Le Uordn on theTech seem to fix the position of this Stabulum.[Ckntuhionks, Ai>; Stabula.] [G.

Book X. given a command, that all the wise men should be put to death,and that among them himself and his three kinsmen were in dan­ger, he went to Arioch, who was captain of the king's guards,and desired to know of him what was the reason why the kinghad given command that all the wise men, and Chaldeans, andmagicians, should be slain; So when he had learned that theking had had a dream, and had forgotten it, and that when theywere enjoined to inferm the king of it, they had said they couldnot do it, and had thereby provoked him to anger; he desired ofArioch that he would go in to the king, and desire respite for themagicians for one night, and to put off their slaughter so long,for that he hoped within that time to obtain, by prayer to God,the knowledge of the dream.

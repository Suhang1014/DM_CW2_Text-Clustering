T - Of the other four paten, the Homoloides is alsothe same in all the rive writers. Of the remainingthree Aeschylus does nut mention their propernames, hut (specifies two by their locality, one asnear the temple of Athena Onca, and the other asthe Northern pate (Bop^cnai ttoAoi), and describesthe last simply as the Seventh pate. The namesof these three pates are nearly the same in tiie otherfour writers, the one near the temple of AthenaOnca being called Crenaeae, and in Statins CulminaDircaea, the Northern eate Ogygiae, and the Seventhpate Hypsistae,— Euripides, however, also giving thename of Seventh to the last •mentioned pate. Having described the position of the Electrae,Proetides, and Neitae, it remains to speak of theposition of the oilier four, which we shall take inthe order of Aeschylus. The fourth gate was pro­bably situated on the western side uf the city, andwas called Crenaeae, because it was near one of thefountains of Dirce, now called Tlapair6pri, situatedupon the right bank of the river. Near that foun­tain was a hill, called by the Greeks uynos, whenceAthena derived the name of Onca. AccordinglyStatins, in calling the fourth pate Culmina Dir­caea, connects both the fountain and the hill. Non-nus, who calls this pate Oncaea, describes it at theRime time as situated towards the west. It isusually stated, on the authority of Hesychius, thatthe Oncaean pate is tlie same as the Ogygian; butthis identification throws everything into confusion,while the change of three letters, proposed by Forch- harnmer, brings the statement of H^ytl i» -*accordance with the other writers.

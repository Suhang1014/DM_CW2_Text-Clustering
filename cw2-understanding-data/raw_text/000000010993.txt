Where­fore relying on the affections of his united subjects, whobecame more strongly cemented every day, although thepower of the Etrurians was so considerable, that their.fame was not only diffused all over the inland country,but also along the western coast, from the Alps to the• straights of Messina; and, though he could have defend­ed himself within his walls, he led his army out to thefield. The Latins here were once more victorious; but.SLneas was among the slain'. By whatever name he hasa right or title to be called, he was buried on the banksof Numicius *, and is invoked by the name of JupiterIndigei. CHAP. III. . Tht reign of Ascanius in Alba ; of JEneas Sylvius, and therest of the Sylvian family. .A.SCAN1US, the son of /Eneas, was too young to takeupon himself the administration; notwithstanding ofwhich, his dominions came unimpaired into his hands,when of age. For such were the abilities and addressof Lavinia, that during his minority, Latium, andwhere-ever his grandfather's or father's sovereignty extended,stood firm in his favour, under her regency. I questionmuch, (for who would assert for truth, a circumstance ofa date so ancient) whether this Ascanius was the son ofLavinia, or one born before him, of Creusa, before thedestruction of Troy, which Julius Ascanius, his father'scompanion in his flight, the Julian family affect to callthe author of their name? This Ascanius, wherever, or of whomsoever born, is ^by all admitted to have been the son of /Eneas. He('finding Lavinium was overstocked with inhabitants, left 'that city, flourishing and opulent as it was, considering *Tlio de Nimi. It ran close by tavinium.

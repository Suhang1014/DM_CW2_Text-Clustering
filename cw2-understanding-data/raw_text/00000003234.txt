Him I had never 1 "injured, either by word or deed: yet he has sent"against me, I know not from whence, a certain"Belisarius, who has cast me headlong from the"throne into this abyss of misery. Justinian is a"man; he is a prince; does he not dread for him-"self a similar reverse of fortune? I can write no"more: my grief oppresses me. Send me, I be- .seech you, my dear Pharas, send me a lyre, a"spunge, and a loaf of bread." From the Vandalmessenger, Pharas was informed of the motives ofthis singular request. It was long since the king ofAfrica had tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen onhis eyes, the effect of fatigue or incessant weeping;and he wished to solace the melancholy hours, bysinging to the lyre the sad story of his own mis­fortunes. The humanity of Pharas was moved; hesent the three extraordinary gifts; but even his hu­manity prompted him to redouble the vigilance ofhis guard, that he might sooner compel his prisonerto embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans,but salutary to himself. The obstinacy of Gelimerat length yielded to reason and necessity; the solemnassurances of safety and honourable treatment wereratified in the emperor's name, by the ambassador ofBelisarius; and the king of the Vandals descendedfrom the mountain. The first public interview wasin one of the suburbs of Carthage; and when theroyal captive accosted his conqueror, he burst into afit of laughter. The crowd might naturally believe,that extreme grief had deprived Gelimer of hissenses; but in this mournful state, unseasonablemirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, thatthe vain and transitory scenes of human greatnessare unworthy of a serious thought.

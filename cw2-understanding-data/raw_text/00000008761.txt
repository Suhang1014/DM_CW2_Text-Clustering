Its name is mentioned in tlicAntonine Itinerary (|>. 85), wiiicherroneously reck­ons it 40 miles from Aleria; the nuns of Mariana,which are still extant under their ancient name atthe mouth of the river G*4o, being only about 30 Imiles X. of those of Aleria.

(Rampoldi, Dtz. G?<>qr. vol. ii.p. 5*0.) [E. H.B.] MAIilA'XA FOSSA. [Fossa Mariana.] MARIAXDY'NI (MamatSuroi. Mafwa^rji o't, orMa. vav5yrui), an ancient and celebrated tribe in tlicnorth-east of Bithynia, between the rivers San-parius and Billaeus, on the east of the tribe called1 hym or Uithyni. (Se\li.\, p. 34; 1'iin. vi. 1.)According to Scylax. they diJ not extend as farwest nsthe Sangarius, fur aceurding to him the river \Hypiui formed the boundary between the Bithyniand Mariundyni. Strabo (vii. p. 295) expresses a ibelief that the Mariandyni were a branch of theItiihvuians. a belief to whieh he was probably ledby the resemblance between their name-, and whichcannot be well reconciled with the statement ofHerodotus (iii. 90), who clearly di.-tin_'ui-iics titeMariainlym from the Thr.n ians or Thyni in Asia.In the Persian army, also, they appear quite Repa-rated from the Bithyni, and their armour resemblesthat of the Paphlagonians, which was quite dif­ferent from that of iheBithyni. (Herod, vii. 72, 75;com p. Strab. vii. p. 345. xii. p. 54°..) The chief city ,in their territory was Heraclea Fontica, the in­habitant-* of which reduced the Mariandym, fir a!time, to a state of servitude resembling that of theCretan Miioae, or the Thessalian Penestae. To whatrare they belonged is uncertain, though if their!TJiracian origin be given up, it must probably beadmitted that thev were akin to the Paphlagonians.In tin* division of the Persian empire they formed[«rt of the third Persian satrapy. Their countrywas called Mariand vnu (Ma^iaroun'a, Stepli, B.g. r.), and Pliny speaks of a Sinus Mariandynus ontheir cost. (Coinp. lb-rat. Eragm. 201: Aescbyl. |I\r*. 932 ; Xen. Anab. vi. 4. § 4.

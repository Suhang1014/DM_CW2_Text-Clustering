It was situated on the eastern bank of theXile, in lat. 25° 3' N. According to Plutarch (7met Otir. c. 73), Ilithyia contained a temple dedicatedt-> Bubastis, to whom, as to the Taurian Artemis,human victims were, even at a comparatively recentperiod, sacrificed. A bas-relief (Minutoi, p. 394,seq.) discovered in the temple of Bnbastis at El-Kah. representing such a sacrifice, seems to confirmPlutarch's statement The practice of human sacri­fice among the Aegyptians is, indeed, called in ques­tion by Herodotus (ii. 45); yet that it once prevailedamong them is rendered probable by Manetho's state­ment of a king named Amosis having abolished thecustom ,and substituted a waxen image for the humanvictim. (Porphyr. de Abstinent, ii. p. 223; Euscb.Praep. Evatu). iv. 16; comp. Ovid, Fast. v. 621.)Tbe singularity in Plutarch's story is the recentdate of the imputed sacrifices. [ \V. B. D.j ILITURGIS. [Iluturgis.] IT.IUM, I'LIOS ("IAioi', i'lMos: Eth. 'IAniii,f. lAiai), sometimes also called Tkoja (Toofa),whence the inhabitants are commonly called Tpuss,and in the Latin writers Trojani. The existence ofthis city, to which we commonly give the name ofTroy, cannot be doubted any more than the simplefact of tbe Trojan War, which was believed to haveended with the capture and destruction of the city,after a war of ten years, B. c. 1184. Troy was theprincipal city of tbe country called Trims. As thecity has been the subject of curious inquiry, both in•Baent and modem times, it will be necessary, in theSot instance, to collect and analyse the statementsft the ancient writers ; and to follow up this discus- roun. sion by an account of the investigations of moderntravellers and scholars to identify the site of thefamous city. Our most ancient authority are theHomeric poems; but we must at the very outsetremark, that we cannot louk upon the poet in everyrespect as a careful and accurate topographer; butthat, admitting his general accuracy, there may yetbe points on which he cannot be taken to account asif it had been his professed object to communicateinformation on the topography of Troy. The city of Ilium was situated on a rising ground,somewhat above the plain between the rivers Sca-mander and Simois, at a distance, as Strabo asserts,of 42 stadia from {he coast of the Hellespont (Horn.II. xx. 216, fol.; Strab. xiii. p. 596.) Thut it wasnot qnite in the plain is clear from the epithetsi\vtp6*aaa, alirtivri, and vrppvntrraa. Behiud it, onthe south-east, there rose a hill, forming a branch ofMount Ida, surmounted by tile acropolis, called Per-gamum (to Tlipyapoy, Horn. II. iv. 508, vi. 512;also to; nipyapa. Soph. Phil 347, 353, 611; or,i] nipyapos, Horn. 77. v. 446, 460.) This fortifiedacropolis contained not only all the temples of thegods (7£ iv. 508, v. 447,512, vi. 88,257, xxii. 172,Sec.), but also the palaces of Priam and his sons,Hector and Paris {II. vi. 317, 370, 512, vii. 345).The city must have had many gates, as may he in­ferred from the expression iraaai irvAai (77. ii. 809,and elsewhere), but only one is mentioned by name,viz., the 2K<uai wi/Acu, which led to the camp of theGreeks, and must accordingly have been on the north­west part of the city, that is, the part just opposite theacropolis (7/. iii. 145, 149, 263, vi. 306, 392, xvi.712, &c). The origin of this name of the "left gate"is unknown, though it may possibly have reference tothe manner in which the signs in the heavens wereobserved ; for, during this process, the priest turnedhis face to the north, so that the north-west wouldbe on his left hand. Certain minor objects alludedto in the Iliad, such as the tombs of Ilus, Aesyetes,and Myrine, the Scopie and Erineus, or tbe wildfig-tree, we ought probably not attempt to urgevery strongly : we are, in fact, prevented from at­tributing much weight to them by the circumstancethat the inhabitants of New Ilium, who believed thattheir town stood on the site of the ancient city, boastedthat they could show close to their walls these doubt­ful vestiges of antiquity. (Strab. xiii. p. 599.) Thewalls of Ilium are described as lofty and strong, andas flanked with towers; they were fabled to havebeen built by Apollo and Poseidon (72. i. 129, ii.113, 288, iii. 153, 384,386, vii. 452, viii. 519).These are the only points of the topography of Iliumderivable from the Homeric poems. The city was de­stroyed, according to the common tradition, as alreadyremarked, about b. c. 1184; but afterwards we hearof a new Ilium, though we are not informed whenand on what site it was built Herodotus (vii. 42)relates that Xerxes, before invading Greece, offeredsacrifices to Athena at Pergamum, the ancient acro­polis of Priam; but this does not quite justify theinference that the new town of Ilium was thenalready in existence, and all that we can concludefrom this passage is, that the people at that timeentertained no doubt as to the sites of the ancient cityand its acropolis. Strabo (xiii. p. 601) states thatIlium was restored during the last dynasty of theLydian kings; that is, before the subjugation ofWestern Asia by the Persians: and both Xenophon(Hilltn. i. 1. § 4) and Scylax (p. 35) seem to speakof Ilium as a town actually existing in their days.

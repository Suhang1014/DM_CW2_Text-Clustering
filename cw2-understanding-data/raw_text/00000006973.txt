And Otho avenged himself in the blood both of theaged emperor and his adopted son. It was Otho's highest recommendationto the degenerate Romans, that he resembled the corrupt and licentious Nero.The rabble, who now ruled at Rome, called him Nero Otho, and were readyat all hazards to follow his fortunes and to defend his throne. Galba hadfallen without a blow struck in his behalf. The cause of Otho was maintainedwith much spirit by followers like himself. In three considerable, though in­decisive, battles, his troops were victorious over those of Vitellius. In a fourth,they were defeated with great slaughter. Still they never wavered in then-attachment or faltered in hope. They urged and entreated him to summonall his forces and renew the fight. But he had resolved not to survive a defeat,tie plunged a dagger to his own heart, and terminated the life t" a debaucheeby the death, as it seemed to the Romans, of a philosopher—as it appears tous, of a fool. The fortitude and composure, not without real or affected gen­erosity, which he displayed in his last hours, endeared him still more to hissoldiers, and many of them made a voluntary sacrifice of their lives at his fu­neral pile (His. 2, 49). Vitellius succeeded without further opposition to the vacant throne. Butlike his predecessors, he had scarcely marched his armies into Rome, beforehe was obliged to march them out again to meet a formidable competitor.Too lazy and stupid from the first to command his own forces, he had now be­come yet more drunken and debauched. Leaving all his military operationsto those generals whose energies alone had raised him to the throne, he gavehimself up to gluttony and intoxication. But one of them, Fabius Valens, hadbecome enervated and diseased by revelling. The other, Alienus Chechia,marches out at the head of the troops, but proves treacherous and makes anunsuccessful attempt to bring his soldiers over to the allegiance of Vespasian.On the other side, the main force had not yet arrived at the field of action fromSyria. Vespasian himself and Mucianus, his commander-in-chief, were stiDin the East. But the ardor and energy, the conduct and prowess of AntoniusPrimus, who happened to be located near the northern border of Italy, amplycompensated for deficiency of numbers, as the loyalty and zeal of Vitellius'army went far to counterbalance the treachery of one, and the absence of theother, of their generals. And the conflict which ensued, was protracted, fu­rious and sanguinary almost beyond a parallel even in the bloody annals ofcivil commotion. Fired not only by party passion, but by a thirst for bootyand blood, the followers of Antonius fought like tigers, nay like demons,through two days and the intervening night, defeated three successive armiesin three successive battles with little intermission, carried two distinct andstrongly fortified walls of defence about Cremona, plundered the treasures ofthat city, took captive its inhabitants and burned its edifices, public and pri­vate, sacred and profane, to the ground. The cause of Vitellius was nowruined. He himself had long given up in despair. In the language of Tacitus,he would have forgotten that he had ever been emperor, had not his followerspersisted in calling him such. They adhered to him with firmness and foughtfor him with desperation, when nothing remained to him but Rome and thedregs of its population. And in this last hopeless struggle the Capitol w«a

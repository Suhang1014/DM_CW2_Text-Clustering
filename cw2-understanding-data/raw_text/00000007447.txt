OCR Output Chap. IX. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. , 35 Nicolaus, one that had been Herod's most honoured friend, andwas now zealous for Antipas : but it was Ireneus the orator,and one who, on account of his reputation for sagacity, was en­trusted with the affairs of the kingdom, who most of all encou­raged him to attempt to gain the kingdom; by whose means itwas, that when some advised him to yield to Archelaus, as tohis elder brother, and who had been declared king by their fa­ther's last will, he would not submit so to do. And when hewas come to Rome, all his relations revolted to him ; not out of*their good-will to him, but out of their hatred to Archelaus;though indeed they were most of all desirous of gaining theirliberty, and to be put under a Roman governor ; but, if therewere too great an opposition made to that, they thought Antipaspreferable to Archelaus, and so joined with him, in order toprocure the kingdom for him. Sabinus also, by letters, accusedArchelaus to Caesar. 5. Now, when Archelaus had sent in his papers to Caesar,wherein he pleaded his right to the kingdom, and his father'stestament, with the accounts of Herod's money, and with Pto­lemy, who brought Herod's seal, he so expected the event; butwhen Caesar had read these papers, and Varus's and Sabinus'sletters, with the accounts of the money, and what were the an­nual incomes of the kingdom, and understood that Antipas hadalso sent letters to lay claim to the kingdom, he summoned hisfriends together, to know their opinions, and with them Caius,the son of Agrippa, -and of Julia his daughter, xvhom he hadadopted, and took him, and made him sit first of all, and desiredsuch as pleased to speak their minds about the affairs now be­fore them.

A town in a smallisland oft' the coast of Cilicia, built hy Archelausking of Cappadocia, to whom the Romans had givenC'ilieia Aspera. (Strab. xiv. p. 671.) It seemsto have received its name Sebaste in honour ofAugustus ; for, until his time, both the island andthe town were called Eleusa, Klaeusa, or Elaeuasa(Joseph. Ant. xvi. 4. § 6, Bell i. 23. § 4; comp.Ptol. v. 8. §4; Hierocl. p. 704: Stadiasm. Mar.Sfagn. § 172, where it is called 'EAfoCs; Steph. B.s. w. ^.tSatTTT) and 'EAcumtriTa), a name whichPliny (v. 22) still applies to the town, though heerroneously places it in the interior of Caria.Stephauus, in one of the passages above referred to,call-. Sebaste or Elaeussa an island, and in the othera peninsula, which may be accounted for by the factthat the narrow channel between the island and themainland was at an early period filled up with sand,as it is at t lie present,- for the place no longer existsas an Uland. S hastc was situated between Corycusand the month of the river Lam us, from which it wasonly a few miles distant. Some interesting remainsof the town of Sebaste still exist on the peninsulanear Ayashtconsisting of a temple of tlie compositeorder, which appears to have been overthrown by anearthquake, a theatre, and three aqueducts, one ofwhich conveyed water into the town from a consider­able distance. (Comp. Beaufort, A'aramania, p. 250,full.; Leake, Asia Minor, p. 213.) 2. A town in Phrygia Pacatiana, between Alyd-da and Eumenia, is noticed only by Hierocles,(p. 667) and in the Acts of the Council of Constan­tinople (iii. p. 674); but its site has been identifiedwith that or the im-dem S'<j'ikhr, where inscriptionsand coins of the town have been found. The ancientname of the place is still preserved in that of theneighbouring stream, SebastiSu. (Comp. Hamilton'sResearch**, i. p, 121, &c.j Arundell, Discoveries,i. p. 136, who erroneously takes the remains atSegiUer for those of the ancient Eucarpiu.) [Cabira, Vol. 1. p. 402.] [L. S.] SEBASTE. [Samauia.] SEBASTEIA (2tSdartta), a town in the south ofp.intus, on the north hank of the I'pper llalys. As itwas near the frontier, Pliny (vi. 3) regards it as notbelonging to Poiitus, but to Cologne in Cappadocia.(Ptol. v. 6. § 10; Hierocl. p. 702; It. Ant pp. 204,205.) The town cxi.-ted as a small place beforetiie dominion of the Romans in those parts, butits ancient name is unknown. Pompey increasedthe town, and gave it the name of Megalopolis(Strab. xti. p. 5r>0). The name Sfbastia must havebeen given to it before the time of Pliny, he being thefirst to use it. During the imperial period it appearsto have risen to considerable importance, so that inthe later division of the Empire it was made thecapital of Armenia Minor. The identity of Sebastiawith the modern Sitcas is established partly by theresemblance uf the names, and partly by the agreement of the site of Sheas with the dtsciiptiunoC Gncn'Nyssa, who states that the town «&> Kftaiti n u*valley of the llalys.

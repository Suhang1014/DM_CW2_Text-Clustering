II.] AGAINST APION. 445 thousand changes in our fortune, by the changes that hap­pened among the kings of Asia, we have never betrayed ourlaws under the most pressing distresses we have been in, norhave we neglected them either out of sloth or for a livelihood.1Nay, if any one will consider it, the difficulties and laborslaid upon us, have been greater than what appears to havebeen borne by the Lacedemonian fortitude, while they neitherploughed their land nor exercised any trades, but lived intheir own city, free from all such pains-taking, in the enjoy­ment of plenty, and using such exercises as might improvetheir bodies ; while they made use of other men as their ser­vants for all the necessaries of life, and had their food pre­pared for them by the others: and these good and humaneactions they do for no other purpose but this, that by theiractions and their sufferings they may be able to conquer allthose against whom they make war.

Nor ought men to wonder at us, if we arcmore courageous in dying for our laws than all other menare; for other men Jo not easily submit to the easier thingsin which we are instituted; I mean working with our handsand eating but little, and being contented to eat and drink 1 Or, we have observed our times of rest and sorts of food allowed us [du­ring those distresses] IV. —38

Now when theEgyptian array had once tasted of this pros­perous success, by the means of Moses, theydid not slacken their diligence, insomuch thatthe Ethiopians were in danger of being re­duced to slavery and complete destruction;and at length they retired to Saba, a royalcity of Ethiopia, which Cambyses afterwardnamed Meroe, after the name of his own sis­ter. The place was to be besieged with verygreat difficulty, since it was both encom­passed by the Nile, and the other rivers As-tapus and Astaborus, made it a very difficultthing for such as attempted to pass over them;for the city was situate in a retired place, andwas inhabited after the manner of an island,being encompassed with a strong wall, andhaving the rivers to guard them from theirenemies; and having great ramparts, betweenthe wall and rivers, insomuch, that when thewaters come with the greatest violence it cannever be drowned, which ramparts make itnext to impossible, for even such as havepassed over the rivers, to take the city. How­ever, while Moses was uneasy at the army'slying idle, (for the enemy durst not come toa battle,) this accident happened: Tharbis,the daughter of the king of the Ethiopians,happened to see Moses, as he led the armynear to the walls, and fought with great cou­rage; and admiring the subtilty of his un­dertakings, and believing him to be the authorof the Egyptians' success, when they had be­fore despaired of recovering their liberty, andto be the occasion of the great danger thatthe Ethiopians were in, when they had be­fore boasted of their great achievements, shefell deeply in love with him, and, upon theprevalency of that passion, sent to him themost faithful of all her servants to discoursewith him about their marriage. He hereuponaccepted the offer, on condition she wouldprocure the delivering up of the city, andgave her the assurance of an oath to take herto his wife; and that when he had once takenpossession of the city, he would not break hisoath to her. No sooner was the agreementmade, but it took effect immediately; andwhen Moses had cut off* the Ethiopians, he gave thanks to God, and having consummatedis marriage, led the Egyptians back to theirland. CHAP. XI. OF MOSES S FLIGHT OUT OF EGYPT INTO MIDIAN. NOW the Egyptians, after they had beenpreserved by Moses, entertained anhatred to him, and were very eager in effect­ing their designs against him, and suspectingthat he would take occasion, from his goodsuccess, to raise a sedition, and bring innova­tions into Egypt, they told the king he oughtto be slain. The king had also some inten­tions of the same nature, and this as well outof envy at his glorious expedition at the headof his army, as out of fear at being broughtlow by him, and being instigated by the sa­cred scribes, he was ready to undertake tokill Moses; but when he had learned before­hand what plots there were against him, hewent away privately; and because the publicroads were watched, he took his flight throughthe deserts, and where his enemies could notsuspect he would travel; and though destituteof food, he went on, and despised that diffi­culty courageously; and when he came tothe city Midian, which lay upon the Red Sea,and was so denominated from one of Abra­ham's sons by Keturah, he sat upon a certainwell, and rested himself there after his labo­rious journey, and the affliction he had beenin. It was not far from the city, and the timeof the day was noon, where he had an occa­sion offered him, by the custom of the coun­try, of doing what recommended his virtue,and afforded him an opportunity of betteringhis circumstances. For that country having but little water,the shepherds used to seize on the wells be­fore others came, lest their flocks should wantwater, and lest it should be spent by othersbefore they came. There were now come,therefore, to this well, seven virgin sisters, thedaughters of Raguel, a priest, and one thoughtworthy by the people of the country of greathonour: these virgins, who took care of theirfather's flock, which sort of work it was cus­tomary and very familiar for women to do inthe country of the Troglodytes, came first ofall, and drew water out of the well in a quan­tity sufficient for their flocks into troughs,which were made for the reception of thatwater: but the shepherds came upon the

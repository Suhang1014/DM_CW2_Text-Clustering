So I followed him directly with twathousand armed men ; and when I was at the city Besara, thatlay in the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs from Gi-bea, where Ebutius abode, I placed my armed men on the out­side of the village, and gave orders that they should guard thepasses with great care, that the enemy should not disturb us, un-till we should have carried off the corn, a great quantity of whichlay there : it belonged to Bernice the queen, and had been ga­thered together out of the neighbouring villages into Besara : so Iloaded my camels and asses, a great number of which I hadbrought along with me, and sent the corn into Galilee.

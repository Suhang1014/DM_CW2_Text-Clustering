But when the people of Jerusalem heard that Jonathan wastaken, and that the soldiers who were with him were destroyed,they deplored his sad fate, and there was earnest inquiry madeabout him by every body, and a great and just fear fell uponthem, and made them sad, lest, now they were deprived of thecourage and conduct of Jonathan, the nations about them shouldbear them ill-will; and as they were before quiet on account otJonathan, they should now rise up against them, and by makingwar with them, should force them into the utmost dangers. Andindeed what they suspected really befell them, for when those na­tions heard of the death of Jonathan, they began to make warwith the Jews as now destitute of a governor; and Trypho him­self got an army together, and had an intention to go up to Judea;and make war against its inhabitants. But when Simon saw thatthe people of Jerusalem were terrified at the circumstances theywere in, he desired to make a speech to them, and thereby torender them more resolute in opposing Trypho when he shouldcome against them.

By this speech of Simon's he inspired the multitude withcourage, and as they had been before dispirited through fear, theywere now raised to a good hope of better things, insomuch, that thewhole multitude of the people cried out all at once, that Simon

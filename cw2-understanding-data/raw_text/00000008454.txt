The boldand beautiful outline of the " White Mountains" isstill called bj its ancient title in modern Greek, toisrpa fiowi, or, from the inhabitants, to iipaxtavafkwa. Crete is the only part of Greece in whichthe word hpn is still in common use, denoting theloftier parts of any high mountains. Trees grow onall these rocky mountains, except on quite the extremesummits. The commonest tree is the prinos orilex. (Pashley, Trac. toI. i. p. 31, vol. ii. p. 190;Hock. A'rrfei, vol. i. p. 19.) [E. B. J.] LEUC1MNA. [Cobcyba, pp. 669, 670.]LEUCOLLA (AewcoAAa), a promontory on thesouth-east of Pamphylia, near .the Cilician fron­tier. (Plin. v. 26; Liv. xxvii. 23 ; Pomp. Mela, i.15.) In the Stadlasmus Maris Magni (§§ 190,191) it is called Leucotheium (AcofcJtfciof). Melamuienoaly places it at the extremity of the gulf ofPamphylia, for it is situated iu the middle of it; itsmodem name is Karaburnu. (Leake, Asia Minor,f- 196.) [L. S.] LEUCOLLA (A*v*oAA«, Strab. xiv. p. 6S2),s harbour of Cyprus, N. of Cape Pedalium. It isreferred to in Athenaeus (v. p. 209, where insteaduf KcMt, Kinrpos should be read), and is identifiedwith Porta ArnwHo e Lucola, S. of Eatnagusta.(Engel, Kypros, vol. i. p. 97.) [E. B. J.] LEUCO'NIUM (Aeiwt*Vioi>). 1. A place mentionedin the Antouine Itinerary (p. 260) in the south ofFannonia, on the road from Aemona to Sirmium,82 Human miles to the north-west of the latter town,lis site is pointed out in the neighbourhood of thevillage of RasboUtje. 2. A town of Ionia, of uncertain site, where» battle was fought by the Athenians in B. c. 413.(Thucyd. viii. 24.) From this passage it seemsclear that the place cannot be looked for on themainland of Asia Minor, but that it must havebeen situated near Pbanae, in the island of Chios,where a place of the name of Leuconia is saidto exist to this day. Polyaenus (viii. 66) mentionsa place. Leuconia, about the possession of whichthe Chians were involved in a war with Erythrae;and this Leuconia, which, according to Plutarch(<it Virt. MuL vii. p. 7, ed. Reiske), was a colonyoi Chios, was probably situated on the coast of AsiaMinor, and may possibly be identical with Leucaemi the Hermaean gulf. [Comp. Leucae.] [L. S.]LEUCOPETRA (Aewcowrrfw), a promontory ofBruttmm, remarkable as the extreme SW. point ofhaW, looking towards the Sicilian sea and the E.coast nf Sicily. It was in consequence generallyf^arded as the termination of the chain of theApennines. Pliny tells us it was 12 miles from Rhe-pum, and this circumstance clearly identifies it*ith the modern Capo dtW Armi, where the moun­tain mass of the southern Apennines in fact descendsto the sea. The whiteness of the rocks composingtliia headland, which gave origin to the ancientname, is noticed also by modern travellers. (Strab.vi. p. 2f>9; Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Ptol. iii. 1. § 9;Swinburne, Travels, vol. i. p. 355.) It is evidentlythe Mine promontory which is called by Thucydidestlerpa Tijj Pwyrns, and was the last point in Italywiiere Demosthenes and Eurymedon touched withtte Athenian armament before they crossed over toSeir/. (Thuc. vii. 35.) It was here also that Cicerotrailed on his voyage from Sicily, when, after thedeath of Caesar, B. c 44. he was preparing to rc- pair into Greece, and where he was visited by somefriends from Rhegium, who brought news fromRome that induced him to alter his plans. (Cic.PkiL i. 3, ad Alt. xvi. 7.) In the former passagehe terms it "promontorium agri Rhegini:" the"Leucopetra Tarentinorum" mentioned by him(ad AtL xvi. 6), if it be not a false reading, mustrefer to quite a different place, probably the head­land of Leuca, more commonly called the Iapygianpromontory. [Leuca.] [E. H. B.j LEUCOPHRYS (AewtoVppus), a town in Caria,apparently in the plain of the Maeander, on theborders of a lake, whose water was hot and in con­stant commotion. (Xenoph. Hell. iv. 8. § 17, iii. 2.§ 19.) From the latter of the passages here re­ferred to, we learn that the town possessed a veryrevered sanctuary of Artemis; hence sumamed Ar­temis Leucophryene or Leucophrvne. (Pans. i. 26.§4; Strab. xiv. p. 647; Tac Attn. iii. 62.) Thepoet Nicander spoke of Leucophrys as a place dis­tinguished for its fine roses. (Atlicn. xv. p. 683.) Respecting Leucophrys, the ancient name of Te-nedos, sec Tekedos. [L S.] LEUCO'SIA (AeoKwta), a small island off thecoast of Lucania, separated only by a narrow chan­nel from the headland which forms the southernboundary of the gulf of Paestum. This headlandis called by Lycophron Ajctt/ 'EciireW, "the pro­montory of Neptune," and his commentators tell usthat it was commonly known as Posidium Promon­torium (to rio(7«(57jiof). (Lyeophr. Alex. 722; andTzetz. ad loc.) But no such name is found in thegeographers, and it seems probable that the promon­tory itself, as well as the little island off it, wasknown by the name of Lencosia. The former isstill called Pttnta delia Licosa; the islet, which is amere rock, is known as /tola Fiona. It is generallysaid to have derived its ancient name from one of theSirens, who was snpposed to have been buried there(Lyeophr. I. c.; Strab. /. c.; Plin. iii. 7. a. 13);but Dionysius (who writes the name Leucasia) as­serts that it was named after a female cousin ofAeneas, and the same account is adopted by Solinus.(Dionys. i. 53; Solin. 2. § 13.) We learn fromSymmachus (£/>/>. v. 13, vi. 25) that the oppositepromontory was selected by wealthy Romans as asite for their villas; and the remains of ancientbuildings, which have been discovered on the littleisland itself, prove that the latter was also re­sorted to for similar purposes. (Romanelli, vol. i.p. 345.) [E. H. B.] LEUCO'SIA (\tvKuaia, AtvKovtrta), a city ofCyprus, which is mentioned only by Hierocles andthe ecclesiastical historian Sozomen (II. E. i. 3,10).The name is preserved in the modern Lefkosia orNikosia, the capital of the island. (Engel, Kypros,vol. i. p. 150; Manti, Viaggi, vol. i. p. 89; Pocockc,Trav. in the East, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 221.) [E. B. J.] LEUCOSYR1 (AfVKoVtyoi), the ancient name ofthe Syrians inhabiting Cappadocia, by which theywere distinguished from the more southern Syrians,who were of a darker complexion. (Herod, i. 72,vii. 72; Strab. xvi. p. 737; Plin. H. N. vi. 3;Eustath. ad Dionys. 772, 970.) They also spreadover the western parts of Pontns, between the riversIris and Halys. In the time of Xenophon (Jnao. v. 6.§ 8, &c.) they were united with Paphlagonia, andgoverned by a Paphlagoniun prince, who is said tohave had an army of 120,000 men, mostly horse­men. This name was often used by the Greeks, evenat the time when it had become customary to desig­

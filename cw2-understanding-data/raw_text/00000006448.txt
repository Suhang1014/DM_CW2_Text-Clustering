The Athenians also obtained a truce,to setch osf their dead the number or which was large,*both in their own troops and thole of their aHies; andyet more arms were taken by the enemy than bore pro­portion to the slain: for, of the number of light-armedwho were pushed to the brink of the precipices, and,throwing away their shields, were obliged to leap down,though some perished by the fall, yet others escapedwith life.

TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK I. people, for a period of more than seven centuries, mustbe a very laborious task; more especially as from a be­ginning the most inconsiderable, they raised themselvesto a pitch of greatness which they are now hardly ableto support. To the generality of readers, too, I doubtnot, but the origin of the city, and what immediatelyfollowed, will be less interesting, whilst they hurry onto these latter times, when, for several years past, thepower of this extraordinary people hath been engagedin working its own destruction.—On the other hand,should I have no other reward for my trouble, whilemy attention is totally engaged in reviewing those scenesof antiquity, I can at least withdraw mine eyes from be­holding the raging wickedness of the times, and conse­quently be void of care, which, though it may not influ- .ence the mind of a writer, with respect to truth, canvery sensibly hurt his feelings. What happened before, and about the time the citywas built, as the accounts are rather embellished withpoetical fables than supported by incontestible authorities,I am resolved neither to affirm nor refute. It is an in­dulgence allowed to antiquity, the better to stamp a su­perior dignity on the original of cities, to blend thingshuman with divine: And if any people on earth canpossibly be allowed the privilege of consecrating theiroriginal, and ascribing it to the gods, such is the mili­tary g!"ry of the Roman people, that when they claima pecultar title to call Mars their author, and the fatherof their founder, all the nations bear it as cheerfully asthey submit to their yoke. But these circumstances,anj'mliers of the same nature, however taken or con­sidered, shall give me no concern. I shall only requestthe reader's serious attention to what respects the livesand manners of this people, the men and measures, inthe cabinet and the field, by which their empire wasfounded and exiended. Then let him still continue toobserve, whilst the strictness of their discipline graduallyrelaxed, first a corruption of their morals, then a con­stant progressive decay, and at last a total degeneracy,till he arrive at the present age, when we can neitherbear our political disorders, nor the application of a re*medy.

Nay, theydesired that Moses would immediately leadthem against their enemies, without the leastdelay, that no backwardness might be an hin­drance to their present resolution; so Mosesclassed all that were fit for war into differenttroops, and set over them Joshua, the son ofNun, of the tribe of Ephraim; one that was of treat courage, and patient to undergo la-ours; of great abilities to understand, andto speak what was proper, and very seriousin the service of God, and indeed, made likeanother Moses, a teacher of piety towardsGod. He also appointed a small party of thearmed men to be near the wafer, and to takecare of the children and the women, and ofthe entire camp; so that whole night theyprepared themselves for the battle, they tooktheir weapons, if any of them had such aswere well made, and attended to their com­manders, as ready to rush forth to the battleas soon as Moses should give the word ofcommand. Moses also kept awake, teach­ing Joshua after what manner he should orderhis camp; but when the day began, Mosescalled Joshua again, and exhorted him to ap­prove himself in deeds such a one as his repu­tation made men expect from him, and togain glory by the present expedition in theopinion of those under him, for his exploits inthis battle: he also gave a particular exhor­tation to the principal men of the Hebrews,and encouraged the whole army as it stoodbefore him; and when he had thus animatedthem, both by his words and works, and pre­pared every thing, he retired to a mountain,and committed the army to God and toJoshua, v^, The armies having joined battle, soon cameto a close fight hand to hand, both sides shew­ing great alacrity, and encouraging one ano­ther; and, indeed, while Moses stretched outhis hands* towards heaven, the Hebrewswere too hard for the Amalekites; but Moses * This eminent circumstance, that while Moses's handswere held up towards heaven, the Israelites prevailed;and while they were let down towards the earth, theAmalekites prevailed; seems the earliest intimation wehave of the proper posture, used of old, in solemn prayer,which was the stretching out the hands and eyes towardsheaven, as other passages of the Old and New Testamentinform us. Nay, hy the way, this posture seems to havecontinued in the Christian church till the clergy, instead not being able to sustain his hands thusstretched out (for as often as he let down hishands, so often were his own people worsted,)he bade his brother Aaron, and Hur, theirsister Miriam's husband, to stand on each sideof him, and take hold of his hands, and notto permit his weariness to prevent it, but toassist him in the extension of his hands.When this was done, the Hebrews conqueredthe Amalekites by main force; and, indeed,they had all perished, unless the approach ofnight had obliged the Hebrews to desist fromkilling any more. So our forefathers obtaineda most signal and most seasonable victory;for they not only overcame those that foughtagainst them, but also terrified the neigh­bouring nations, and got great and splendidadvantages, which they obtained of their ene­mies by their hard pains in this battle; forwhen they had taken the enemies' camp, theygot great booty for the public, and for theirown private families, whereas till then theyhad not any plenty even of necessary food.The afore-mentioned victory was also theoccasion of their prosperity, not only for thepresent, but for future ages also; for they notonly made slaves of the bodies of their ene­mies, but effectually damped their nlinds: andafter this battle became terrible to all thatdwelt round about them. They also acquireda vast quantity of riches; for a great deal ofsilver and gold was left in the enemies' camp,as also brazen vessels, which they made com­mon use of in their families; many utensilsalso that were embroidered, there were ofboth sorts; that is, of what were woven, andwhat were the ornaments of their armour andother things that served for use to their family,and for the furniture of their rooms; they gotalso the prey of their cattle and of whatso­ever uses to follow camps, when they removefrom one place to another; so the Hebrewsnow valued themselves upon their courage,and claimed great merit for their valour; andthey perpetually inured themselves to take of learning their prayers by heart, read them out of abook, which is in a great measure inconsistent with suchan elevated posture, and which seems to me to have beenonly a later practice under the corrupt state of the church.Though the constant use of divine forms of prayer, praise,and thanksgiving, appears to have been the practice ofGod's people, Patriarchs, Jews, and Christians, in all thepast ages. . . .

OCR Output ROMA. ROMA. was nearest to the river. "Cominius in Capitol turnevadit" is here equivalent to ''Romulus in Capi­tolium escendit," in a piissage befure cited. (Liv.i. 10.) Hence, to mark the spot more precisely,the historian inserts "ad Carmentis" in the follow­ing chapter. There is nothing in the other autho­rities cited in Becker's note (no. 750) which yieldsa conclusion either one way or the other. We might,with far superior justice, quote the following passageof Cicero, which we have adduced on another occa­sion, to prove that the attempt of the Gauls was ontheXr.r ur citadel: " Atque ut ita munita Arx cir-cunijeetu arduo et quasi circumciso saxo niteretur,ut etiam in ilia tempestate horribili Gallici adventusineolumis atque intacta permanserit" (DeHep.il.6). But, though we hold that the attempt wasreally on the Arx. we are nevertheless of opinion thatCicero here uses the word only in its general sense,and thus as applicable to the whole hill, just as Livyuses Capitolium in the preceding passage. Hence,Mr. Bunbury ((.lass. Mus. vol. iv. p. 430) and M.IVeller (I. c.) have justly regarded this narrative asaffording no evidence at all, although they are ad­herents of the German theory. We may furtherobserve, that the house of Manlius was on the Arx;and though this circumstance, taken by itself, pre­sents nothing decisive, yet, in the case of so sudden:i surprise, it adds probability to the view that theArx was on the southern summit. We now proceed to the next illustration, which isdrawn from the account given by Tacitus of theattack of the Vitellians on the Capitol. Becker'sinterpretation of this passage is so full of errors, thatwe must follow him sentence by sentence, giving, firstof all, the original description of Tacitus. It runs asfollows: Cito aginine forum et imminentia furoteinpla praetervecti crigunt aciem per adversum col-Icm usque ad primas Capitolinae arcis fores. Erantantiquitus porticus in latere clivi,dextrac subeuntibus:in quaruni tectum egressi saxis tegulisque Vitellianosobrucbant. Neque illis manus nisi gladiis armatae;et arcesserc tonnenta ant missilia tela longum vide-batur.

Inde lapsus ignis in por­ticus appositas aedibus: mox sustmmtes fastigiumaquilae vetcrc ligno traxerunt tiammam aluerunt-que. 5ie Capitolium clausis fori bus indefeusuin etimlireptum con flag rav it." (Hist. iii. 71.) "The attack," says Becker, "is directed solelyagainst the Capitol; that is, the height containingt he temple, which latter is burnt on the occasion"(p. 390). This is so far from being the case,that the words of Tacitus would rather show thatthe attack was directed against the Arx. Thetemple is represented as having been shut up, andneither attacked nor defended: "clausis furihus,indefensum et imlireptum eonflagravit." Such astate of things is inconceivable, if, as Becker says,the attack was uirected solely against the Capitol.That part of the hill was evidently deserted, and I left to its fate; the besieged had concentrat**'selves upon the Arx, which thus becam* the p*-i! of attack. By that unfortunate atiiUguiT* a 2#use of the word Capitolium, whi;.h we tart bas'-npointed out, we find Tacitus repre^e^tinc li*of the Capitolium as having U-tn U."u:' *z -que CapitoUi fures ") which, if CapitalurrmraE! \arsame thing in the hist sentence, v«jU1 be a -r-*contradiction, as the gates are there rr^-r-J*as shut. But in the first passage he c>o_» 'Jtgates of the fortification which entks*d tbisummit of the hill; and in the second pa»ohe means the gates of the temple. Ti* m~ing of Tacitus is also evident in another 3ii-ner; for if the Vitellians were attacking t» *»■pie itself, and burning its gates, they ia«aalready gained a footing on the height aac r*jiconsequently have had M occasion to s*tk mxnt >fother routes — by the steps of the Ru:« Tir,e*,and by the Lucus Asyli, Becker prote^Js: 'Ta­citus calls this (i.e. the height with the terj~*indifferently Capitol in* Arx and Capitohaaa."

It is now sprier, near tlie small streamcalled Speierbach, which flows into tlie Rhine. Insome of the late Notitiae we read " civitas Nemetum,id est, Spin." (D'Anville, Xotice, <fc) 3. A town of the Batavi, is the Dutch town ofXynu-rjen, on the Vahalis ( Waal). It is marked inthe Tahle as a chief town. D'Anville observes thatthe station Ad Duodecimum [DcODBCXMCY, An]is placed by the Table on a Roman road, and nextto Noviomapus ; and that this shows that Novio-mapus bad a territory, for capital places used toreckon the distances from their city to the limits oftheir territory. 4.

The river bends a pood deal below Trier, andin one of the elbows which it forms is Xcumaffen,the representative of Noviomapus. It is mentionedin Ananoittt'fl poem (Mosefla, v.

P. from SoUsons,at.d 34 M P. from Amiens. But their distances, asD'Anville says, are not exact, for Noviodmtuin isAm/on, which is further from Amiens and nearer toSoatotu than the Itin. fixes it. The alteration ofthe name Noviomapus to Xoyon is made clearerwhen we know that in a middle age document thename is Noviomum, from which to Sot/on the changeis easy. [G. L.] NOVIOMAGUS (No«Wor. Ptol ii. 3. § 28).capital of the Regni in Britannia Prima, marked inthe Itin. Ant. (p. 472) as the first station on thern.id from London to Durovernum, and as 10 milesdistant from the former town. It has been variouslyplaced at IVoodcote in Surrey, anil iJul wood Jfiil inKent. Camden, who adopts the former site in hisdescription of 5wrre*(p. 192), seems in hisdescrip-tion of Kent (p. 219) to prefer the latter; whereon the little river Ravetuboum^ there still remaintraces of ramparts and ditches of a vast extent.This site would also agree better with the distancesin the Itinerary. [T. H.

He lias to correct the distance also in theItin. between Tamnum and Noviorepum to makeit atrree with the distance between Talmon andHoyan. [(;.

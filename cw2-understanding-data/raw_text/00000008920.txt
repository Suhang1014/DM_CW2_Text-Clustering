The Tiber is unquestionably, in n merely geo­graphical point of view, the most important river ofCentral Italy, but its great celebrity is derived fromits flowing under tlie walls of Pome, or rather throughthe heart of the city, after this had attained to itsfull extension. The detailed account of the river inthis part of its course must be sought in the articleRoma: we need here only mention that after flow­ing under the Milvian Bridge [Pons Milvius orMulvius] the river makes a considerable bend tothe W. ao as to approach the foot of the Vaticanhills, and leave, on the other side, between its leftbank and the nearest ridge of hills, a broad tract ofplain, early known as the Campus Martius, thewhole of which was eventually included within theimperial city. A short distance lower down, butstill within the walls of the city, its stream was di­vided into two by an island known as the Txsi'LATiitLiiiNA, and reported by tradition to have beenformed by alluvial accumulations within the periodof Roman history. It is remarkable that this is theonly island of any consideration in the whole courseof the river, with the exception of that failed theInsula Sacra, at its mouth, formed by the twoarms of the river, and which is undoubtedly of lategrowth, and in great part of artificial formation. The Tiber was at all times, like most rivers whichare supplied principally by mountain streams, aturbid, rapid, and irregular river, that must alwayshave presented considerable difficulties to navigation.The yellow and muddy hue of its turbid waters is re­peatedly alluded to by the Roman poets (" flavum Ti-berim," Hor. CarmA. 2.13; " suo cum gurgite ilavo,"Virg. Aen. ix. 816; &c), and the truth of Virgil'sdescription," Vorticibus rapid is et multa flavus arena,"{Aen. vii. 31), must be familiar to every one who hasvisited Rome. In the upper part of its course, aswe learn from Pliny, the river was with difficultynavigable, even for small boats ; nor did its firsttributaries, the Tinia and Clanis contribute much toits facilities in this respect, though their waters wereartificially dammed up, and let off from time to timein order to augment the main stream. (Plin. iii. 5,s. 9.) But from the point of its junction with theNar, the Tiber became navigable for larger vessels,and even from an early ]>eriod extensive supplies ofvarious kinds were brought down the river toRome. (Liv. ii. 34, v. 54; Cie. de Rep. ii. 5;ficc) In the more flourishing period of the citythe navigation of the Tiber was of course enor­mously increased; and vast supplies of timber,stone, and other materials for building, as well ascorn and provisions, were continually introduced bymeans of the river and its tributaries. (Strab. v.p. 235.) Corn was brought down the Tiber evenfrom the neighbourhood of Tifernmn, when the upperpart of the stream was navigable. (Plin. Ep. v. 6.)it seems also to have been used as an ordinary modeof travelling, as we are told that in A. d. 20, Piso,the murderer of Germanicus, proceeded from Narniato Rome by descending the Nar and the Tiber. (Tac.Amu iii. 9.) At the pren'nt day the river is navi­gated by boats of large size as far as the confluenceof the Nera, and small steamers ascend as far asBorghetto, n few miles from Otricoli. But it, was from Rome itself to the sea. a distanceof 27 miles by the river (Strab. v. p. 232), that thenavigation of the Tiber was the most important,Pliny speaks of it as in this part of its course na­ vigable for the largest vessels (" (mimftrt tarn-rum navium ex I lab man <-spai ~),a$Gthe receptacle of merchanae-r from dtn pr.dtMworld.

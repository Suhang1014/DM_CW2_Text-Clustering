The warmest ap­plause has been lavished on the virtue of the Ro­mans, who abstained from the exercise of this tempt­ing privilege above five hundred years: but the samefact evinces the unequal terms of a connexion inwhich the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant,and the tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his slave.When the Roman matrons became the equal andvoluntary companions of their lords, a new jurispru­dence was introduced, that marriage, like other part­nerships, might be dissolved by the abdication of oneof the associates. In three centuries of prosperityand corruption, this principle was enlarged to fre­quent practice and pernicious abuse. Passion, in­terest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for thedissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message,a letter, the mandate of a freedman, declared theseparation: the most tender of human connexionswas degraded to a transient society of profit or plea­sure. According to the various conditions of life,both sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury:an inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to a newfamily, abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious,progeny to the paternal authority and care of her latehusband; a beautiful virgin might be dismissed tothe world, old, indigent, and friendless; but the re­luctance of the Romans, when they were pressed tomarriage by Augustus, sufficiently marks, that theprevailing institutions were least favourable to themales. A specious theory is confuted by this freeand perfect experiment, which demonstrates, that theliberty of divorce does not contribute to happiness

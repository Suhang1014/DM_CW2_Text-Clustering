Their capital city wasBoviant;m (Liv. ix. 31), in the very heart of theSamnite territory, and it is therefore probable thatthey occupied the whole of that rugged and moun­tainous district which extends from the frontiers ofLatium, in the valley of the Liris, :o those of theFrentani, towards the Adriatic. But it is impossibleto determine their exact limits, or to separate theirhistory from that of the remaining Samnites. It isprobable, indeed, that, throughout the long wars ofthe Romans with the Samnites, the Pentri were theleading tribe of the latter people, and always tookpart in the war, whether specified or not. The onlyoccasion when we hear of their separating tbcnrelvesfrom the rest of their countrymen, is during theSecond Punic War, when we are told that all the!other Samnites, except the Pentri, declared in favour Iof Hannibal after the battle of Cannae, u. c. 21G.; (Liv. xxii. 61.)

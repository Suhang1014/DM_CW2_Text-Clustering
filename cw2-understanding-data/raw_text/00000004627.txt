Theday of the elections approached ; and, as it was highlyinexpedient that Publilius should be recalled, when onthe point of assailing the enemy's walls, and in dailyexpectation of gaining possession of their city, appli­cation was made to the tribunes, to recommend to thepeople the passing of an order, that Publilius Philo,when his year of office should expire, might continuein command as proconsul until the war with the Greeksshould be finished. A letter was despatched to LuciusCornelius, with orders to name a dictator; for it wasnot thought proper that the consul should be recalledwhile he was employed in vigorously prosecuting thebusiness of the campaign, and had already carried thewar into Samnium.

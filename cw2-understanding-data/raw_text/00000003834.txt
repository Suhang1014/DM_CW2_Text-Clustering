XI. As to the silence of Clement of Alexandria, who citesthe Antiquities of Josephus, but never cites any of the testi­monies now before us, it is no strange thing at all, since henever cites Josephus but once, and that for a point of chro­nology only, to determine how many years had passed fromthe days of Moses to the days of Josephus, so that his silencemay almost as well be alleged against a hundred otherremarkable passages in Josephus's works as against thesebefore us. XII. Nor does the like silence of Tertullian imply thatthese testimonies, or any of them, were not in the copies ofhis age. Tertullian never once hints at any treatises ofJosephus's but those against Apion, and that in general onlyfor a point of chronology: nor does it any way appear thatTertullian ever saw any of Josephus's writings besides, andfar from being certain that he saw even those. He hadparticular occasion in his dispute against the Jews to quoteJosephus, above any other writer, to prove the completionof the prophecies of the Old Testament in the destructionof Jerusalem, and miseries of the Jews at that time, of whichhe there discourses, yet does he never once quote him uponthat solemn occasion; so that it seems to me, that Tertulliannever read either the Greek Antiquities of Josephus, or hisGreek books of the Jewish wars ; nor is this at all strangein Tertullian, a Latin writer, that lived in Africa, by noneof which African writers is there any one clause, that Iknow of, cited out of any of Josephus's writings: nor is itworth my while, in such numbers of positive citations of theseclauses, to mention the silence of other later writers, as beingrere of very small consequence.

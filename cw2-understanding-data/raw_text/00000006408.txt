OCR Output 372 NOTES ON THE Tacitus calls a pernicious superstition. Pliny adds, inthe same letter, that, in order to come at the real truth,he ordered two female slaves to be put to the torture, buthe could discover nothing more than a rooted and ex足cessive superstition. Trajan, in his answer to this letter,determines, that if Christians are brought before thegovernor, and proved to be guilty, they must be punished,unless they renounce their errors, and invoke the gods ofRome. In that case they were to be pardoned, notwith足standing any former suspicion. But the emperor says tohis minister, " I would not have you officiously enter into" any enquiries concerning them." Pliny's letter, Mr.Melmoth observes, is esteemed as almost the only ge足nuine monument of ecclesiastical antiquity, relating tothe times immediately succeeding the apostles, beingwrote not above forty years after the death of Paul. Itwas preserved by the Christians themselves, as a clear'and unsuspicious evidence of the purity of their doctrines.It is therefore with good reason, says Brotier, that'Ter-tullian, in a strain-of exultation, declares, That the Christ*ians, " for their innocence, their probity, justice, truth," and for the living God, were burnt alive. The cruelty," ye persecutors !. is all your own ; the glory is ours."Pro tantd innocentid, pro tantd probitate, pro justitid,pro virtute, pro Deo vivo cremamur: Crudelitas pcstra;gloria est nostra. (d) The Jews, as will be seen in the History, book v.s. 5, were charged with harbouring a sullen" aversion to足wards all mankind. It is unnecessary to vindicate dieChristian religion from that imputation. fej Juvenal alludes, with his usual indignation, to thebarbarous cruelties described by Tacitus. See sat. i.ver. 155.

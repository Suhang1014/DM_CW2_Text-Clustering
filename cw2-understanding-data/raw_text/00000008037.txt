But in the later periodof the Roman Empire the Athesis seems to havebeen generally recognised jis the W. boundary ofVenetia, though not so strictly ns to exclude Verona,the greater part of which was situated on the rightbank of the river. Towards the N. the boundarywas equally indefinite: the valleys and southern(dopes of the Alps were occupied by Rhaetian andEuganean tribes; and it is probable that the limitbetween these and the Veneti, on their S. frontier,was always vague and arbitrary, or at least deter­mined merely by nationality, not by any geographicalboundary, as is the case at the present day with theGerman and Italian races in the same region.Tims Tridentum, Feltria, and Belunnm, were all ofthem properly Rhaetian towns (Plin. iii. 19. s. 23).though included in the Tenth Region of Augustus,and for that reason often considered as belonging toVenetia. On the E. the limits of Venetia were more definite.The land of the Carni, who occupied the greater partof the modern Frioul, was generally considered ascomprised within it, while the little river Eormio(Risano), a few miles S. of Tergeste, separated itfrom Istria. (Plin. iii. 18. s. 22.) Several authors,however, regard Tergeste as an Istrian city [Ter-gestk], and must therefore have placed theboundary either at the Timavus, or where the Alpscome down so close to the sea, between that riverand Tergeste, as to prevent the road being continuedalong the coast. There can be no doubt that thispoint forms the natural boundary of Venetia on theE., although the Formio continued under the RomanEmpire to constitute its political limit. The physical peculiarities of the region thuslimited are very remarkable. The greater part ofVenetia is, like the neighbouring tract of CisalpineGaul, a broad and level plain, extending, without in­terruption, to the very foot of the Alps, and furrowedby numerous streams, which descend from thosemountains with great rapidity and violence. Thesestreams, swollen by the melting of the Alpine snows,or by the torrents of rain which descend upon themountains, as soon as they reach the plain spreadthemselves over the country, forming broad beds ofsand and pebbles, or inundating the fertile tract oneach side of their banks. Continually stagnatingmore and more, as they flow through an almost per­fectly level tract, they form, before reaching the sea,considerable sheets of water; and the action of thetides (which is much more perceptible at the headof the Adriatic than in any other part of that sea orof the Mediterranean) combining to check the outflowof their waters, causes the formation of extensivesalt-water lagunes, communicating with the seaonly through narrow gaps or openings in the longline of sandy barriers that bounds thein. Suchlacunes, which occupy a great extent of ground S. ofthe present mouth of the Po [Padi's], are con­tinued on from its X. bank to the neighbourhood ofAltinum; and from thence, with some interruptions,to the mouth of the Ison:o,M the head or inmost bightof the Adriatic. So extensive were they in ancientt imes that there was an uninterrupted line of inlandnavigation by these lagunes, which were known asthe Sejitem Maria, from Ravenna to Altinum, a dis­tance of above 80 miles. (Itin. Ant. p. 126.)Great physical changes have naturally taken placein tlhe course of ages in a country so constituted. Onthe one hand there is a constant tendency to the fillingup of the lagunes with the silt and mud brought down by the rivers, winch converts them zrt :imarshes, and eventually into firm land. Oc u*other hand the rivers, which have for ace* WaT-fined within artificial banks, keep pashin- <a 'i*ffmouths into the sea, and thus creating b*fkr*i---iwhich give rise to fresh lagunes. At lbe sr ttime, the rivers thus confined, from tkm to t^-break through their artificial barriers and feet* re*channels for themselves; or it is futmd neefssa-TMcarry them off by new and artificial t-otlets. *i*s»all the principal streams of Venetia. from ifc* Ad**to the Piare. are at the present day carried u Utsea by artificial canals; and it U doubtful wbftarany of them have now the same outlet as in ascii;times. In the eastern portion of Venetia. frcm the fl«to the foot of the Alps near Aquileia. these rhy-*^*characters are less marked. The coa&t is indeed or­dered by a belt of marshes and 1 agones, bat ci zsgreat extent: and within this, the rivers that de­scend from the Alps have been for the nwi partleft to wander unrestrained through the plai£. is:have in consequence formed for themselves br*beds of stone and shingle, sometimes of scrpriaB*extent, through which the streams in their gtiizm?*condition roll their diminished waters, the trtajvolume of which contrasts strangely with the br«a£iand extent of their deposits. Such is the ei^racxespecially of the Tagliamente, the largest r-Tir cthis part of Italy, as well as of the TVrr. tatNathone, and other minor streams. The imf oiarr Jof their channels, resulting from this state of tiar*is sufficiently shown by the fact tliat tlw rivenTurrus and Natiso, which formerly flawed under catwalls of Aquileia, have now changed their cecw.and join the Isonzo at a distance of more this 4miles from that city. [Aqcilkia.] Of the history of Venetia previous to tbe Earnconquest we know almost nothing. It *e ocgs*sj at that time by two principal nations, tlj« Ve5£7*1 from whom it derived its name, in the \V„ aod tar| Carni in the E-; the former extending frra ta*: Athesis to the Plavis. or perhaps to the Tilsv^mr*^. the latter from thence to the borders of Islria. &-*I the origin and affinities of the Veneti themselraa anextremely obscure. Ancient writers represent thee ■! a very ancient people (Polyb. ii. IT), but at theI time are generally agreed that they were n<4 tiw«vt.>'nal inhabitants of the tract that they occupied.

But till very recently the opinionmost commonly adopted was that of Leandro Alberti,an antiquary of the 16th centary, who placed it onMonte Calvi (Descriz. if ft alt a. p. 27), in a woodcalled Select di Vetleta; and who has been followedby Cluverius (Ital. Ant. ii. 2. p. 472), by Miiller(Etrwker, i. p. 211), &c. It is now, however,generally admitted that Vetulonia is to be identifiedwith the remains of a city, discovered in 1842 bySig. Pasquinelli, an Italian engineer, »t Magliano,a village between the Osa and the Albsgna, and 8 or10 miles to the N. uf Orbelello. To Mr. Dennis(Cities and Sepulchres of Etruria. vol. ii. eh. 48),however, is to be assigned the credit of first identi­fying these remains as those of the lost Etruscancity. Their site agrees with what we learn respectingthat of Vetulonia. Pliny and Ptolemy (11. cc.) agreein placing the latter among the inland colonies ofEtruria; yet Pliny (ii. 103. s. 10G) also describes it asbeing not far from the sea, and as having hot springs,the Aquae Vetuloniae, in its neighbourhood. Mow,all the necessary conditions are fulfilled by the re­mains alluded to. The circuit of the walls, about 4£miles, shows it to have been an important city; itssituation with regard to the sea agrees with theaccount of Pliny; and near Telamcmaccio, at adistance of only 200 or 300 yards from the coast,and in the vicinity of the newly found city, warmsprings still exist. For other reasons which led Mr.1'ennis to the opinion which he formed, the reader isreferred to liis work before cited, and to his paper inthe Classical Museum, vol. ii. p. 229, F©q.

It joins the Amasenus (stillcalled Amaseno) during its course through themarshes to the sea at Ttrracina, but the presentchannels of both rivers are artificial, and it is un­certain whether they united their streams in ancienttimes or not. The name is corrupted by Strabointo Aufidus (Atf<J>i5os, v. p. 233), but he correctlydescribes it as one of the chief agents in the forma­tion of the Pontine Marshes. The ancient form of |the name was Oufens, whence the Roman tribeOufentina derived its name, being composed ori­ginally of citizens settled in the territory andneighbourhood of Privernum (Feat. s.v.

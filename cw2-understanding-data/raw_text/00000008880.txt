(Strub. I.e.; Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Pto!.in. 1. § 9; Tab. Pent.) Pausanias expressly tellsus it was still inhabited in his day; and Pliny alsonotices it for the excellence of its wine. (Pans. vi.6 § 10; Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8.) The period of its de­struction is unknown; but after the fall of theRoman Empire the name wholly disappears, andits exact site has never been determined. The be*tclue is that afforded by the Tabula (winch accordswell with the statements of Pliny and Strabo),that it was situated 10 miles S. of Clampetia. Ifthis last town be correctly placed at Amantea[Clampetia], the site of Tempsa must be lookedfor on the coast near the Torre cUl Piano del Ciuale,about 2 miles S. of the river Savuto, and 3 fromAWcttj.

S.] I EMNUS ( TTj^roy: Eth. Ttj^h'ttjj). a town ofAeolis in Asia Minor, not far from the river Hermus,situated on a height, from which a commanding viewwas obtained over the territories of Cyme. Phocaea,and Smyrna. (Strab. xiii. p. 621.) From a pa>sagcin Pausanias (v. 13. § 4). it might be inferred thatthe town was situated on the northern bank of theJlermus. Hut this is irreconcilable with the state­ment that Teinnus was 30 miles south of Cyme, andwith the remarks of all other writers alluding tothe place. Pliny (v. 29) ulso seems to l»e mistakenin placing Temnus at the mouth of the Hermus, foralthough the deposits of the river have formed anextensive alluvial tract of land, it is evident that thesea never extended as far as the site of Temnus. Thetown had already much decayed in the time of Stra-bo. though it never ap|-ears to have been verv large.(Xenoph. //ell. iv. 8. § 5; Herod, i. 149;" Polyh.xx. 25; Cic. pro Flaec. 18.)

Fellows (/>wcot*. in Lffcia, p. 196, &c),and in Texier'swork (fhscription >h VAsie Mincurt),where the ruins are figured in 22 plates. Thetheatre at Myra, says Sir Charles, is among thelargest and the best built in A.sia Minor: much ofit.s fine corridor and corniced proscenium remains.The number of tombs cut in the rock is not large,but they arc generally very spacious, and consistof several chambers communicating with one another.Their external ornaments are enriched by sculpturedstatues in the rocks around ; but they are mostlywithout inscriptions (see the plate of one in Sir C.Fellows' Uiscov, facing p. 198, and numerous othersin a plate facing p. 2(H)). On the whole, the ruinsof Myra are among the most beautiful in Lycia.(Comp. Spratt and Forbes, Travels In f.ycia, Vol. i.p. 131, &c.) '[L.S.] MYHCIXUS (MvpKtvos, Steph. B.; MupKtvyos,Tzctz.

It offered great advantages tosettlers, as it contained an abundant supply oftimber fur shipbuilding, as well as silver mines.(Herod, vii. 23.) Aristagoras retired to this place,and, soon after landing, perished before some Thra-cian town which he was besieging. (Herod v. 126;Time, iv, 102.) Afterwards^ it had fallen into thehands of the Edoni; but en tlh' murder of Pittacus,chief of that people, it surrendered to Brasilia-;.(Time. iv. 107.)

Artaxerxes gave (iry­neium and Myrina to Gongylus an Eretrian. who hadbeen banished from his native city for favouring theinterests of Persia. (Xenoph.

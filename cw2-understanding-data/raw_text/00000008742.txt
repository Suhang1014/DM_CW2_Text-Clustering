L.] VATREXUS (Santerno), a river of GalliaCispadana, one of the southern tributaries of theJ'ad us. It had its sources in the Apennines, flowedunder the walls of Forum Cornelii (Wa), andjoined the southern branch of the Pad us (ttieSpineticum Ostium) not far from its mouth, for«hich reason the port at the entrance of that arm,of the river was called the Tortus Vat rent. (Plin.iii. 16. 8. 20.) The Santemn now flows into thePo di Prinuiro (the modern representative of theSpinetic branch), above 16 miles from its mouth:hut the channels of both are in this part artificial.In this lower part of its course it must always havebeen more of a canal than a river, whence Martialuses its name as typical of a sluggish stream.(.Martial, iii. 67. 2.) * [E. H. B.] UBERAE, a nation in India extra Gangern, men­tioned by Pliny (vi. 19. s. 22). It possessed a largetown of the same name. It is not possible to deter­mine its exact position; but. from the names of othernations mentioned by Pliny in connection with theIrl>erae, it is probable that this people lived near themouths of the Brahmaputra. [V-J U'llII (OC€ioi), a German people who in Cae­sar's time lived on the east bank of the Rhine andopposite to the Treviri, for Caesar having made hisbridge in the country of the Treviri passed over intothe country of the Ubii. Owinc to their proximityto the Rhine they were somewhat more civilised thanthe other Germans, being much visited by mer­chants and accustomed to Gallic manners (B. G.it. 3, 18, vi. 29, 35). The Sigambri were theneighbours of the Ubii on the north. The Sueviwere pressing the Ubii hard, when the Ubii appliedto Caesar for help: they gave him hostages, andoffered to supply him with a large number of boatsto cross the river, from which we may infer that theywere accustomed to navigate the Rhine. (B. G. iv.16.) In the time of Augustus (Strab. iv. p. 194),the nation crossed the Rhine, and Agrippa assignedthem lands on the west bank of the river, the policyof the Romans being to strengthen the Rhenishfrontier ■gainst the rest of the Germans. (Tacit.Germ. c. 28, Annai xii. 27; Sueton. Aug. c. 21.)In the new territory of the Ubii was Colouia Agrip-pina {Coin), and hence the people had the name ofA g rip pine uses, which was one of the causes why theGermans east of the Rhine hated them. Theywere considered as traitors to their country, whohad assumed a new name. (Tacit. Hist. iv. 2S.)North of the Ubii on the west side of the Rhinewere the Gugerni [Gi'GKRNi]; and south of themwere the Treviri. [Colonia Agkippina; AraUbiobum.] [G. L.] UKIO'KL'M ARA.

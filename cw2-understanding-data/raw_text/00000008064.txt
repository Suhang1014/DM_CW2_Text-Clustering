In this passage, however, Strabo callsthem Sapae (Sairai), and assumes their identitywith the Sinti, which in another place (x. p. 457)he treats as a mere matter of conjecture. The ViaK_'iia:ia ran through tlu'ir country, and especiallythrough a narrow and difficult defile called by Ap*pian (B. C. iv. 87, 106) the pax* of the Sapaei, andMated by him to he 18 miles from Philippi; so thatit must bare been nearly midway between Neapolisand Abdera. The Sapaei are mentioned, and merelymentioned, by Herodotus (vii. 110) and by Pliny(iv. II, s. 18). Their town is called Sapaica(lawaXrft) bv Stepli. B. (s. v.). [J. R-] SAPAICA. [Sapam.] SAPARNUS (San-a/jfos), a small tributary ofthe Indus, in the upper Punjab, noticed by Arrian(Indie, c. 4). It is probably the present Abba-sin. [V.] SAPAUDIA. This name occurs in AmmianusMarcellintu (xv. 11), in his description of Gallia.He says of the Rhone that after flowing through theLake of Geneva " per Sapaudiam fertur et Sequanos."In the Notit. Imp. we read: u in Gallia Ripense prae-fectos militurn Barcarionun Ebruduni Sapeudiae,"where Ebrudunum appear! to be Yrerdim, which isat one end of the Lake of Neufchatel. In anotherpassage of the Notit. there occurs : *' tribunus cohor-tis primae Sapaudiae Flariae Calaraoe," or "Cula-rone," which is Grenoble [Cclako]. Thus Sapau-dia extended northward into the country of theHelvetia and southward into the territory of theAllobroges. The name Sapandia is preserved inSaboia, or Savin/, but in a much more limited signifi­cation ; and in the country now called Savoy thereis said to be a canton which bears the particular nameof Savoy. (D* Anville, Notice, t/c.) [G. L.] SAPHAR [Safphar.] SAPHE. [Bezabda.] SAPHRI (2a^i), a small village of Parthyenementioned by Esidorui (Sloth. Forth, c. 12). Itmay be the same place as that called by Ptolemy2,6p€a (vi. 9. § 6), wliich he places in Hyrcania,close to the AsUbeni. Forbiger identities it withthe modem Skaffri.

SAPIS (2am y, Strab.: San'o), a small river ofCisalpine Gaul, not far from the frontiers of Um-hria. It rises in the Umbrian Apennines, a fewmiles above Sarsina, flows under the walls of thattown, and afterwards, pursuing a course nearly dueN., crones the Aemilian Way close to the town ofCaeseua (Cesena). and falls into the Adriatic about10 miles S. of Ravenna. (Strab. v. p. 217; Plin.iii. 15. s. 20; Lucan. ii. 406; Sit. Ital. viii. 448;Tab. Petit.) It is called in the Tabula Sabis; andthe name is written laapia in several editions ofLucan and Strabo; but there seems little doubt thatfcvipis is the true form of the name. It is still calledthe Savio. There can be little doubt that the S.v-PUflA Tnuirs, mentioned by Livy (xxxi. 2, xxxiii.37), as one of the tribes or divisions of the Umbriannation, immediately adjoining the Gaulish' tribe ofthe Bi»ii, derived its name from the Sapis, and mosthave dwolt on the banks of that river.

S.] TAPURE1 (Tanox'peoi, PtoL vi. 14. §§ 12. 13),a tribe in Scythia intra Imaum. [T. H. !>.] TAPU'RI (Tdirovpot or Tdirvpoi, Strab. XL p.520; PUn. vi. 16. s. 18), a tribe whose nameami probable habitations appear, at differentperiods of history, to have been extended alonga wide space of country from Armenia to the east­ern side of the Oxns. Strabo places them along­side the Caspian Gates and Rhagae, in Parthia,(xi. p. 514), or between the Der bices and Ujrcaoi(xi. p. 520), or in company with the Amardi andoilier ]>eople al>ng the Hitithern shores of the Cas­pian (xi. p. 523); in which Uvst view Curtius (vi. 4.§ 24. viii. I. § 13), Diunysius (tie Situ Orbis. 733).and Pliny (vi. 16. s. 18) may be considered to co-iiu ide. Ptolemy in one place reckons them amongthe tribes of Media (vi.2.$)6), and in another ascribesthem to Blargiana (vi. 10. § 2). Their name iswritten with some differences in different authors;thus Tdwovpoi and Tawpoi occur in Strabo; Ta-puri in Pliny and Curtius; Tdrvppoi in Staph* B.There can be no doubt that the present district ofTaberistdn derives its name from them. Aelian(1*. //. iii. 13) gins a peculiar description of theTajiiiri who dwelt iu Media. (Wilson, Arinna, p.157.) [V.] I'APU'RI MONTES, a chain of mountains, inScythia, to the N. of the Jaxartes, apparently aportion of tlie Altai ranee, towards its western ex­tremity (Ptol vi. 14. § 7). It may, however, bedoubted whether this view of Ptolemy is reallycorrect. It would seem more likely that they are con­nected with the Tapuri, a tribe who nearly adjoinedthe Uyrcani [Tapvh]; and this a notice in Poly hi uswould awx'ar clearly to imulv (v. 44\ [V.] TARACHI (Tapaxoi, 1'tol. vii. 4. § 8)."a tribeof Taprobane or Ctyhm, who occupied the SK. cornerof the M.ind bel'jw the Mulea mountains (AflamsPeak). They appear to bare had a port called 'HAiov\iuT)y, probably in the neighbourhood of the presentVmtam, Near to them was a river called theBarace (Ptol. vii. 4. § 5). It is not unlikely thatthe river and the people had once the same name,which hat since been modified by the change of theinitial letters. [V.] TARANDRUS (TdpavBpot; Eth. Tapdv&pios), aplace in Phrjgia of unknown site, is meutioned onlyby Stephanas Byz. ( s. v.). [L. S.] TAKAXEI, a people in Arabia Deserta of un­known site. (Plin. vi. 28. s. 32.)TAKAS. [Taickntlm.]TARASCON (TapaaKuv: Tarascon).a tows iatlie Provincia Xarbonensis, on the east side of theIikone, between Aries and Avignon The railwayfrom A vifjnon to Marseille passes through Tarascon,and there is a branch from Taraxcxm to Mimes.Ptolemy (m whose text the name is written Tapow-rrKwy) enumerates Tanaoon among the towns of theSalyee [Sai.yks]. Strabo (iv. p. 178) says that theNad from Xemausus (Xirues') to Aquae Scxliac >p;isses through Utremum (licavcairc) and Tarascon,and that the distance from Xemausus to AqnaeBextiac is 53 Roman miles; which, as D'Anville ob- |serves, is not correct. In another passage (iv. p. 187)Strabo makes the distance from Ximes to the bankof the Rhone opposite to Tarascon about 100 stadia,which is exact enough. [TAKiscostiiXSES ] [G.L.] TARBA.

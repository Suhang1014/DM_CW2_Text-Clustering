A port ontins coast, named Portus Aepatiaii, was guarded bysome Neman troops according to the Notitia.IVAnville concludes that the Nervii extended fromtheir inland position to the coast, and had part of itbet«pen the Morini and the mouth of the Scheldt;a conclusion for which there is little evidence, and agood ileal against it. [Mknatii; Morini.] [G.L.] NE'RVII {Ntpotitot, Ncp€ioi), a nation of Belgiea,whose capital according to Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 1 1) wasItatraeuin (Barat). When Caesar was preparing(n.r, 57) to march against the Belgian confederates,lie was informed that the Nervii had promised toMipply 5o,(M)0 men for the general defence, andthat they were considered the most savage of all theconfederates. (B. G, ii. 4.) The neighbours of theNervii on the south were the Ambiani. (B. G. ii.15.) In Caesar's time the Nervii had not allowed II mercatores" to come into their country; tfieywould not let wine be Smarted and other tilingswhich encouraged luxury. When Cacsitr hadmarched for three days through their territory, helearned that he was not more than 10 Roman milesfrom the Sabis (Samhri), and the Ken ii werewaiting for him on the other side with the Atrebatesand Veromandui, their border people. Thus weascertain that the Atrebates, whose chief town isArras, and the Veromandui, whose chief place was.67.

We murtpose that Caesar wrote of the events as th^r in­curred, and that he did not alter what he bdwritten. In B.C. 57 he supposed that he fcilstrayed most of the fighters of the Nervii. In M54 he found that he was mistaken. In B.c. &the Nervii were again preparing to give mrcbW 1the Roman governor; but he tutored their cwntrin the winter season, and before they had rixelrally or to escape, he took many prisoner?. dn"-w (many head of cattle, and ravaged their land. »M1compiled them to come to terms.

Appian (de BtlL Gad i| speaks of the Nervii as descendants of the Tea'iand Cimbri ; but this is worth very little.

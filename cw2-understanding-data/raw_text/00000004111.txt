OCR Output JOSEPHUS'S DISCOUESE ABOUT HADES. 461 to an ill catastrophe. Whosoever shall have lived wickedlyand luxuriously may repent: however, there will be need ofmuch time to conquer an evil habit; and even after repentÂ­ance, his whole life must be guarded with great care anddiligence, after the manner of a body, which, after it hathbeen a long time afflicted with a distemper, requires a stricterdiet and method of living: for though it may be possible,perhaps, to break off the chain of our irregular affections atonce, yet our amendment cannot be secured without the graceof God, the prayers of good men, the help of the brethren,and our own sincere repentance and constant caro. It is agood thing not to sin at all; it is also good, havmg sinned,to repent, as it is best to have health always; but it is a goodthing to recover from a distemper. To God be glory anddominion for ever and ever, Amen. UND OF THE WRITINGS OF J0SEPIIUS. 89*

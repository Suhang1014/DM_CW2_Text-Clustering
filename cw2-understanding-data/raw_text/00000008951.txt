(Pans, i. 44. § 7, seq.) The tortoise at thefoot of the rock, which was said to devour the rob­bers, was probably a rock called by this name fromUs shape, and which gave rise to the tale (Kara -H)?KaXevpiyriv xfAcvrnv, Diod. iv. 59). On the sum­mit of the mountain was a temple of Zeus Aphesins.On descending into the plain was the temple ofApollo Latous, near which were the boundaries ofIfararis and the Corinthia. (Paus. i. 44. §§ 9, 10.)Megaris contained only one town of importance,Mxoara, with its harbour Nisaea, which havebeen already described. The other towns in thecountry were Akgosthena and Pegae (DoricI'agab), on the Alcyonian or Corinthian gulf; Tri-roumcus and Rhus, in the interior; Piiibalis, onthe confines of Attica (Schol. ad Aristoph. Acharn.802); and Piialycon and Poliohne, of whichthe site is uncertain. There was also a fortress,Gkkaheia, situated on one of the mountains of thissame, but its position is also uncertain (Scylax,p. 15; Plin. iv. 7. s. 11); it is apparently the sameplace as the Ekeseia ('Ep«'«ia) of Pausanias (i. 44.§ 5). Scylax mentions a place Aris, but instead ofUt--,"3i. tuxos Tcpeu'cia, 'Apis, it has been conjee-tared that we ought to read UttyaX t«ixos< r*po-r«a ixptt or axpa. Whether there was a place ofthe name of Isus in Megaris seems doubtful.[Isus.] (Reinganum, Da* alie Megari*, Berlin,1825; Dodwell, voL ii. p. 181, seq.; Leake, Northern(rrwee, vol. ii. p. 388, seq.) com of megara. MEGARTS. [Mec.ara.]ME'GARIS, a small island on the coast of Cam-puiU, mentioned by Pliny (iii. 6. s. 12), who placesit between Pausilypos and Neapolis; it can thereforebt do other than the islet or rock now occupied bythe Cattel dell Oro. [Neapolis.] It is evidentlythe same which is called by Statius Megalia. (Stat.Sic ii. 2. 80.) [E. H. B.] MF.G1DDO. [Leoio; Magdolum.]MEGIDDO VALL1S, the western part of the1st plain of Esdraelon, at the northern foot ofMoist Carmel, watered by the Kishon. [Es-m:« uix Valus v. Campus.] [G. W.] MEGISTE (Mtylimi), an island off the coast ofLTcia, opposite to Antiphellus. It contained a town■aieh, if the reading in Strabo (xiv. p. 666) beafreet, was called Cisthene (Kiof^nj), but hadpBiahed before the time of Pliny (v. 35). There«m also an excellent harbour, which appears tohats been capable of containing a whole fleet. (Livmrii. 22; comp. Steph. B. «. v., who calls the townMeziste; Ptnl. v. 3. § 9; Scylax, p. 39.) The island,*Qlcd dented its name from the fact that it is thehtfrest of a group, is now called Kasteloryzo, or'-'■"Iff liauo. The island seems to have been colo­ nised by the Rhodians, or at least to have been intheir possession, for inscriptions found there arocomposed in the Doric dialect. There are but fewremains of ancient buildings. (Leake, Asia Minor,p. 184; Fellows, Lgcia, pp. 187, &c.) [L. S.] MEGISTUS. [Macestus.] MEIACARIRE (Amin. Marc, xviii. 6, 10;yiaiajcaptpt, Theophyl. Simoc. i. 13, ed. Bonn), asmall place in Mesopotamia, mentioned by Ammianusand Theophylact. It appears to have been at nogreat distance from Amida. Ammianus 6tates thatit derived its name from certain cold springs whichwere there. (Cf. Booking, Notit. DigniU i. p.418.) [V.] MEILICHUS. [Achaia, p. 13, b.] MELA or MELLA, a river of Gallia Transpa-dana, still called the Mella, which rises in theAlps, flows through the Val Trompia, ancientlythe residence of the Triumpilini, enters the plain ofLombardy near Brixia, and falls into the Ollius(Oglio) more than 20 miles below that city. Ca­tullus speaks of it as flowing through the city ofBrixia, but this is an inaccuracy or a poeticallicense, as it passes, in fact, about a mile to theW. of it. [Brixia.] Both he and Virgil describeit as a placid and winding stream. (Catull. lxvii.33; Virg. G. iv. 278 ; Philargyr. ad he.) [E.H.B.] MELAE. 1. A town of the Samnites, mentiom donly by Livy (xxiv. 20), among the towns of theCaudine Samnites which were taken by Fabins inB.C. 214. The same author elsewhere (xxvii. 1)mentions a town of the Samnites which he callsMeles, and which was not taken till b. c. 210, byMarcellus. Nevertheless, it is probable that thesame place is meant in both cases, but we have noclue to its position. 2. A town in the neighbourhood of Locri in Brut-tium, mentioned by Thucydides (v. 5), but other­wise wholly unknown. [Locri.] [E. H. B.] MELAENA (MeAawa). 1. A promontory ofIonia, forming the north-western point of the penin­sula which is traversed by Mount Mimas. It wascelebrated in ancient times for its quarries of mill­stones. (Strab. xiv. p. 645.) It is possible thatthis promontory, which is now called Kara-Burun(the Black Cape), may be the same as the one calledby Pliny (v. 31) Corynaeum Promontorium, fromthe town of Coryne, situated at the southern ex­tremity of Mount Mimas 2. A promontory of Bithynia, on the right handon sailing through the Bosporus into the Euxine,between the rivers Rheba and Artane. (Apollon.Rliod. ii. 651; Orph. Argon. 716; Arrian, Peripl.p. 13; Marcian, p. 69.) In the anonymous Periplusof the Euxine (p. 2), it is called KaWlvaKpov, andPtolemy (v. 1. § 5) calls it simply BiOwfas tutpov.Its modern name is Tihili. 3. The north-western promontory of the island ofChios (Strab. xiv. p. 645), now called Cape 5.A'icofo. [L. S.] MELAENAE. [Attica, p. 329, b.]MELAENEAE or MELAENAE (MtAaircal.Paus.; MeAcm-ai. Khun. ap. Steph. B. ». v.: l-'.tliMeAaiKus), a town of Arcadia, in the territory olHeraea, and on the road from Hemes to Megalopolis.It was distant 40 stadia from Buphagium. Pau­sanias says that it was founded by Melaeneus, theson of Lycaon, but that it was deserted in his timeand overflowed with water. The ruins of Melaeneaelie 4 or 5 miles eastward of Heraea, between thevillages Kokora and Kakoreot, where are the re­

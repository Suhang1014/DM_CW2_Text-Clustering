Superbus, who courted the friendship of the Latincities, Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum was theforemost man of all the race, tracing his descentfrom Ulysses and Circe. Him Tarquin conciliatedby the gift of his daughter in marriage, and thusobtained the powerful alliance of his family and con­nections, (lav. i. 49; Dionys. \v. 45.) The ge­nealogical pretensions of the pens Mamilia are stillto be seen on their coins, which bear on theobverse the head of Mercury, and on the reverseUlysses in his travelling dress and with his dog.'1'he alliance of Mamilius with Iarquin, however,was the main cause of the Latin War. AfterIns expulsion from Rome, and unsuccessful at­tempt to regain his crown by means of the Etrus­cans, Tarquin took refuge with his son-in-law atTusculum (Liv. ii. 15), and by his assistanceformed an alliance with the confederacy of the thirtyLatin cities, (/£». 18). The confederate army tookup a position near Lake Kegillns, a small sheet ofwater, now dry. which lay at the foot of the hillon which Tusculum is seated. This was the sceneof the famous battle so fatal to the Latins, in u. c497. Mamilius, who commanded the Latin army,was killed by the hand of Titus Herminius; Tar-quinins Superb us himself, who, though now ad­vanced in years, took a part in the combat, waswounded; and the whole Latin army sustained anirretrievable defeat (»6. l'J. 20; Dionys. vi. 4, seq.). Alter the peace which ensued, the Tusculans re­mained for a long while the faithful allies of Rome;nil attachment which drew down on their territorythe incursions of the Voisci and Aequi, n. c. 461,460. (Liv. iii. 7: 8.) In B. c. 458, when theRoman capitol was seized by the Sabine AppiusHerdonius, the Tusculans gave a signal proof oftheir love and fidelity towards Rome. On the nextmorning after the arrival of the news, a large bodyof them inarched to that city and assisted theRomans in recovering the capitol; an act for whichthey received the public thanks of that people (io.18; Dionys. x. 16); and soon afterwards, LuciusMamilius, the Tusculan dictator was rewarded withthe gift of Roman citizenship. (Liv. to.29.) In thefollowing year the Romans had an opportunity ofrepaying the obligation. The Aequi had seized thecitadel of Tusculum by a nocturnal assault. At thattime, Fabius with a Roman army was encamped beforeAntium; but, on hearing of the misfortune of theTusculans, lie immediately broke up his camp andHew to their assistance. The enterprise, however, wasnot of such easy execution as the expulsion of Her­donius. and several months were spent in combats inthe neighbourhood of Tusculum. At length theTusculans succeeded iu recapturing their citadel byreducing the Aequi to a state of famine, whom theydismissed after compelling them to pass unarmedunder the yoke, lint as they were flying homewardsthe Roman consul overtook thein on Mount Algidus,and slew them to a man. (/o\ 23; Dionys. x. 20.) Iu the following year, the Aequi, under the con-duet of Gracchus, ravaged the Labican and Tus­culan territories, and encamped on the Algidus withtheir booty. The Roman ambassadors sent to ex­postulate with them were treated with insolence andcontempt. Then Tit. Quinctius Cincinnatus waschosen dictator, who defeated the Aequi, and causedthem, with their commander Gracchus, to passiirnominiously under the yoke. (Liv. ib. 25—28.)Algidus became the scene of a struggle between theRomans and Aequi on two or three subsequent occa­ sions, as in B.c. 452 ar.<i 447.

The inscription ofthis monument lias been preserved to us by I'liny(iii. 20. s. 24), and is one of our chief authoritiesfor the geography of the Alpine tribes. The ruinsof the monument itself, which wns of a very massivecharacter, still remain, and rise like a great towerabove the village of Turtria, the name of which isevidently a mere corruption of Trofaf.a Augusti(Tooraia ifgeurrov, Ptol. iii. 1. § 2), or TropakaAlpium, as it is termed by Pliny (/. a). The line of the Roman road, cut in the face of thomountain, may be traced for some distance on eachside of Tvrbia, and several ancient milestones havebeen found, which commemorate the construction ofthe road by Augustus, and its reparatiou by Hadrian.(Millin. Voy. en Piemmt, vol. ii. pp. 135, 138;Durante, Chorographie du Comti de Nice, pp. 23—30.) The port of Monoecus seems to have been theextreme limit towards the E. of the settlements ofMassilia, and hence both I'liny and Ptolemy regard itas the point from whence the Ligurian coast, in themore strict sense of the term, began. (Plin. iii. 5.a. 7; Ptol. iii. 1. §§2, 3.) Ptolemy has made astrange mistake in separating the Portus Herculisand Portus Monoeci, as if they were two distinctplaces. [E.H.

This is one of the posi­tions in the Roman ltins. along the Rhine. Theyplace it between Helvctutn or Hclcebus [Hkix"K1)i;sJand Urunci. There is no doubt that is Vieux-Brisach or Altbreisach, as the Germans call it Allthe positions of the ltins. on the Rhine are on thewest or Gallic side of the river, but Yieux-Brisachis on the east side. The Rhine has changed itsbed in several parts, and this is one of the placeswhere there has been a change. Breisach is de­scribed by Luitprand of Pavia (quoted by D'Anville),as being in the tenth century surrounded by theRhine " in modum insulae." It may have been onan island in the Roman period. The hill (mons) ofAltbreisuch is a well marked position, and was oncecrowned by a citadel. Altlyreisnch is now in theducby of Baden, and opposite to Xeubreuack on theFrench side of the Rhine. [G.

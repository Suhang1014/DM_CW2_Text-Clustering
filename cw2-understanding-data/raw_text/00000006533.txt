He then recommended to them a steady re-*( sistance, and by no means in any shape to give way** to the enemy: For, could the State once be secured** from its public fops, a reconciliation amongst its"members might easily be hoped for; but, should** either party be once destroyed, either this at Samos,"or theirs at Athens, none would soon be left to be** reconciled at all." There were present at this audience embassadors fromthe Argives, who brought assurances of aid to the peo­ple of Athens at Samos. Alcibiadcs commended themfor their zeal j and then, exhorting them to hold them­selves in readiness to come upon a summons sent, hecivilly dismissed them. These Argives came to Samosin company with the Paralians, who had been latelyturned over by the four-hundred into a vessel of war, tocruize round Eubcea, and to carry to Lacedæmon theembassadors, Læspodias, Aristophon, and Melesius,sent thither from the four-kundred. But, when ad­vanced to the height of Argos, they put the embassa­dors under arrest, as chief agents in pulling down thedemocracy, and delivered them up to the Argives. Theyhad no business now at Athens, and so came from Argosto Samos, convoying the Argive embassadors in thetrireme which they had seized. The fame summer, Tissaphernes, — about that junc­ture of time in which the Peloponnesians were most fu­rious against him, for the other reasons, and the recall-ment of Alcibiades, as having now pulled off the maskand declared for the Athenians, —- desirous, as in truthit appeared, to efface the bad impressions they had en­tertained of him, got ready to go to Aspendus to thePhœnician fleet, and prevailed with Lichas to bear himcompany. In regard to the Peloponnesians, he decla­red that he substituted his own lieutenant, Tamas^ topay them their subsistence, whilst he himself should be absent.

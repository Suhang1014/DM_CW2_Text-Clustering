OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.— BOOK XXVIII. J63 to 3fou the province that you desire. I therefore callon you, tribunes, to support me in refusing to give myopinion, and for this reason, that, although a majorityshould concur with me, yet the consul would appealfrom their judgment.' On this an altercation arose,Scipio insisting that it was unfair for the tribunes tointerpose, so as to prevent any senator from giving hisopinion on being asked it in his place.

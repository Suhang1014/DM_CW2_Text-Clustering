Atnm.Marc. xxii. 8. § 21), a Scythian people, dwelling tothe S. of Colchis and N. of Media. According toHerodotus and Stephanus (//. cc.) they were an in­land people, but Apollonius places them on the sea-coast. They belonged to the 18th satrapy of thePersian kingdom (Herod, iii. 94), and were armed inthe same manner as the Coichians, that is, withwooden helmets, small shields of untanned hide,bliort lances, and swords (lb. vii. 79). The Pa­risian scholiast on Apollonius derives their namefrom the abundance of supplies found in their coun­try. The Saspeires appear to have inhabited thatdistrict of Georgia lying on the upper course of theriver Cyrus, in which Tijlis lies, which is still calledTschin Kartuel; and as the district contains seve­ral other places, the names of which begin with thesyllable Tschin, Ritter conjecture* that the Sa­speires were identical with the eastern Iberians, re­specting whom the Greeks invented so many fables.(Rennell, Geogr. of Herod, p. 503; Ritter, Erdhmde,ii. p. 922; Biiur, ad Herod, i. 104.) [T. H. I).] SA'SSCLA, a town of Latium, situated in theneighbourhood of Tibur, of which city it was a de­pendency. It is mentioned only by Livy (vii. 19)among the towns taken from the Tiburtines in B.C.354, and was probably always a small place. Thesite has been identified by Gell and Xibby with theruins of an ancient town, at the foot of the hill ofSic Mono, between 7 and 8 miles from Tivoli( Tibur). The ruins in question, consisting of a lineof walls of polygonal construction, surrounding ahill of small extent, unquestionably indicate thesite of an ancient town; but as we know that theTiburtine territory contained several other townsbesides Empulum and Sassula, the only two whosenames are known to us, the identification of thelatter is wholly arbitrary.

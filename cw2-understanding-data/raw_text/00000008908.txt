The more m.icnificcnt of thetwo stands upon the top of a sandy hill, and appearsto have been a species of Pantheon, since, accordingto extant inscriptions, it was dedicated to Aroeres(Apollo) and the other deities of the Ombite nomeby the soldiers quartered there. The smaller templeto the N\V. was sacred to Isis. Both, indeed, are ofan imposing architecture, and still retain the bril­liant colours with which their builders adornedthem. They are, however, of the Ptolemaic age,with the exception of a doorway of sandstone, builtinto a wall of brick. This was part of a templebuilt by Thothmes III. in honour of the crocodile-headed god Sevak. The monarch is represented onthe door-jambs, holding the measuring reed andchisel, the emblems of construction, and in the actof dedicating the temple. The Ptolemaic portionsof the larger temple present an exception to analmost universal rule in Aecyptian architecture. Ithas no propylon or dromos in front of it, and theportico lias nn uneven number of columns, in allfifteen, arranged in a triple row. Of these columnsthirteen are still erect. As there are two principalentrances, the temple would seem to be two unitedin one. strengthening the supposition that it was thePantheon of the Ombite nome. On a cornice abovethe doorway of one of the adyta is a Greek inscrip­tion, recording the erection, or perhaps the restora­tion of the sekos by Ptolemy Philometor and hissister-wife Cleopatra, u. c. ISO—145. The hill onwhich the Ombite temples stand has been con­siderably excavated at its base by the river, whichhere strongly inclines to the Arabian bank. The crocodile was held in especial honour by thepeople of Oinbi; and in the adjacent catacombs areoccasionally found mummies of the sacred animal.Juvenal, in his 15th satire, has given a lively de­scription of a fight, of which he was an eye-witness,between the Ombitae and the inhabitants of Ten-tyra, who were hunters of the crocodile. On thisoccasion the men of Oinbi had the worst of it; andone of their number, having stumbled in his flight,was caught and eaten by the Tentyrites. The sa­tirist, however, has represented Oinbi as nearer toTcntyra than it actually is, these towns, in fact,being nearly 100 miles from each other. The Hu­man coins of the Ombite nome exhibit the crocodileand the eftiiry of the crocodile-headed god Sev;ik. The m<>dern hamlet of Koum-Ombos, or the hillof Ombos, covers part of the site of the ancientOinbi, The ruins have excited the attention ofmany distinguished modern travellers.

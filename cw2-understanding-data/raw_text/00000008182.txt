There can be little doubt that the namerepresents at once the country and the town of theMalli. ta'ing itself derived from the Sanscrit Mala-tthiini. Pliny speaks of Malli quorwn MonsMallus (vi. 17. ». 21). If his locality corre-sjionds with that of the other geographers, the namemiirht be taken from the mountain which was con­spicuous there. It is not, however, possible fromriiny's brief notice, to determine anything of theposition of his Malli. It was in this country, andnot improbably in the actual town of the Malli (asArrian appears to think) that Alexander was nearlyblain in combat with the Indian tribes nf theranjab. [V.] MALLUS (MaAAiii: Eth.yiaXKti-rns), an ancientcity uf Cilicia, which, according to tradition, wasfounded in the Trojan times by the soothsayersMopfus and Ampltilochus. (Strab. xiv. p. 675, &c.;Arrian, Anab. ii. 5.) It was situated near the mouthof the river Pyramus, on an eminence opposite toMc^arsus, as we must infer from Curtius (iii. 7),who states that Alexander entered the town afterthrowing a bridge across the Pyramus. Mallustherefore stood on the eastern bank of the river.According to Scylax (p. 40) it was necessary to sailnp the river a short distance in order to reach Mallus;and Mela (i. 13) also states that the town is situatedclose upon the river; whence Ptolemy (v. 8. § 4)must be mistaken in placing it more than two milesaway from the river. M;dlns was a town of consi­derable importance, though it does not appear tohave possessed any particular attractions. Its port-town was Magarsa [MaoarsaJ, though in latertimes it seems to have had a port of its own, calledPortiis Palonun (Geogr. Nub. p.195; Sanut.

There is no reason toreject these testimonies, though we have no otheraccount of the existence of such a place; and itsposition cannot be determined with any greater pre­cision. But the Mamertini who figure in historyas the occupants of Messana are wholly distinctfrom the citizens of this obscure town. [Mu.SANA ] [E. H.

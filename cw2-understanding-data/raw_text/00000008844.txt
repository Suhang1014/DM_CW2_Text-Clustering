Bat, to have faced the Porticus Vip-aania, Martial's house must not only have beensituated on the western side of the Quirinal, but alsotowards its southern extremity; which likewiseappears from what has been said in the precedingsection respecting the route from it to that of hisfriend Pliny being through the Subura and VicusCyprius j for this would have been a roundaboutway had Martial dwelt towards the northern part ofthe hill. All these circumstances tend to show that Kama'sCapitol must have stood on the spot before indicated,and the temple of Flora a little to the N. of it. Thepart of the hill which it occupied was probably thatcalled Latiaris in the Argive fragments. Thepart styled CoLLIS Sahtakis must have beenthat near the gate of the same name, derived fromthe ancient Sacellum of Salus, which stood nearit; in place of which a regular Temple of Salvswas dedicated by C. Junius Bubulcus, n. c. 203(Liv ix. 43, x. 1). and adorned with paintings byFabius Pictor. These were still to be seen in thetime of Pliny, when the temple was destroyed byfire in the reign of Claudius (xxxv. 7; cf. VaLMax. viii. 14. § 6). Cicero's friend At ticus lived close to the temple ofSalus ("—tuae vicinae Salutis," ad Att. iv. 1), andat the same time near that of Quirinus: "Certe nonlonge a tuis aedibus inambulana post excc.ss.mnsmim Romulus Proculo .Julio dixerit, se deum esseet Quirinum vocari, tcmplnmque sibi dedicari in eoloco jusserit." (Dc Leg. i. 1.) The vicinity of thetemples is likewise indicated in another passage rela­ting to a statue of Caesar, which had been erectedin that of Quirinus: "De Caesare vicino scripseramad te, quia cognoram ex tuis Uteris; cum uvvvaavQuirino inalo quam Saluti" (ad Att. xii. 4o).Hence the sites of the two temples in question arestill further established. For as that of Salus layon the N. side of the hill, near the Porta Salntaris,and that of Quirinus some 200 yards to the S. of it,at the church of 5. Andrea, so we may assume thatthe house of Atticus lay between the two, and hewould thus he a close neighbour to both. Another ancient sacraiium on the Quirinal wasthat of SeMO Sancts or Dius Funus. We haveshown, when treating of the Servian gates, that thePortaSanqualis took its name from this sacellum: andLivy (viii. 20) describes it as facing the temple ofQuirinus. Hence it must have stood on or near thesite of the Palazzo Quirinale, l>etwecn the temple ofSalus and that of Flora. It had a perforated roof,for the deity loved the open air, whence his title ofDins; and some thought that no oath by this godshould be sworn under a roof. (Varr. L, /,. v. §6(1.) Sancus was an old Sabine deity, and histemple at Home appears to have been founded byTatms. (Ov. Fast vi. 213; Prop. v. 9. 74; Tcr-tuli. ad Nat. ii. 9.) Its antiquity is attested by thecircumstance that the distaff and sandals of Tana-quit, tlie wife of Tarquinius Priscus, are recorded tohave been preserved in it, and are said to havebeen in existence down to the time of Augustus.(Plin. viii. "4; Plut. Q. R. 30.) It appears tohave been rebuilt by Tarquinius Superbus, but itsdedication was reserved for Sp. Post urn i us. (Dionys.ix. 60.) The part of the hill where it stood musthave been the Collis Mucialis of tho Argivefragments. (Varr. v. § 52.)

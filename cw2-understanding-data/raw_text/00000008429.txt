Wm rery celebrated on account of j The Paphlagonians are described by the ancients asa superstitious, silly, and coarse people, though thisseems to apply to the inhabitants of the interiormore than to those of the coast. (Xenoph. A nab.v. 9. § 6; Aristoph. Eq. 2, 65, 103, 110; Luciau,Alex. 9. foil.) Besides the Paphlagonians properand the Greek colonists on the roa>t, we hear of tbeHeneti and Macrones, concerning whose nationalitynothing is known: they may accordingly have beensubdivisions of the Paphlagonians themselves, or theymay hare been foreign immigrants. Until the time of Croesus, tbe count 17 wasgoverned by native independent princes, but thatking made Paphlagonia a part of his empire.(Herod, i. 28.) On the conquest of Lydia by Cyrus,the Paphlagonians were incorporated with the lVr>:;uiempire, in which they formed a part of the thirdsatrapy. (Herod, iii. 90.) But at that great dis­tance from the seat of the government, the satrapsfound it easy to assert their independence; andindependent Paphlagonian kings are accordinglymentioned as early as the time of Xenophon(Anal. v. 6. § 3, 9. § 2). In the time of Alex­ander the Great, whose expedition did not touchthose northern parts, kings of Cappadoria andPaphlagonia are still mentioned. (Arrian, A nab.it. 4. § 1; iii. 8. § 5; Diod. Sic. aria. 16.) Butthis independence, though it may have been merelynominal, ceased soon after, and Paphlagonia andCappadocia fell to the share of Eumenes. (Diod.Sic. xviii. 3; Justin, xiii. 4, 16.) After Eumenes*death, it was again governed by native prince*,until in the end it was incorporated with the kingdomof Pontus by Mithridates. (Arrian, op. Phot. y. 72,ed. Bekker; Diod. Eclog. xxxi. 3 j Justin, xxxvii. 1;Strab. xii. p. 540; Appian, Mithrid. 11, 12.) Mi­thridates, however, soon afterwards divided Paphla-gonia with his neighbour Nicomedes, who made hisson, under the name of Palaemenes, king of Paphla­gonia. (Justin, xxxvii. 3, 4.) After the conquestof Mithridates, the Romans united the coa*>t dis­tricts of Paphlagonia with Bithynia, but the in­terior was again governed by native princes (Strab,le.; Appian, B. C. ii. 71 ; Plut. Pomp. 73); andwhen their race became extinct, the Romans incor­porated the whole with their empire, and thence­forth Paphlagonia formed a part of the province ofGalatia. (Stiab. vL p. 288, xii. pp.541, 562.)In the new division of the empire in the fourthcentury, Paphlagonia became a separate province,only the easternmost part being cut off and addedto Pontus. (Hierocl. pp. 695, 701.) The priDcipa]coast towns were Amastuih, EitvTiiiM, Ciu>mna,Cttoki:», Akgialus, Abonitichos, Cim« .lis.Stephank, Potami, Ai:mim. SmorS, and Ca-RUSA. The whole of the interior of the countrywas divided, according to Strabo, into nine districts,viz. Blaene, Domanetis, Pimolisene, Cimiatene, Ti-monitis, Ozatorigus, Mannolitis, Sanisenc, and Po-tamia. The interior contained only few towns, suchas Pompeiopolis, Gangra, and some mountain for­tresses. [L.

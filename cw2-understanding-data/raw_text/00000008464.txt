Ptolemy mentions two places of the nameone in Gedrosia, and the other in Caramania; butthere can be no doubt that the same place is in­tended. Arrian Bpeaks of a place which he calls raMoTapvo, on the coast of Gedrosia, which was occu­pied by the Ichthyophagi {Indie. 26). Vincent, whohas examined this geographical question with muchcare, thinks that this port must have been situateda little west of the modern cape Passenee or Pasmee.{Voyage of Nearchus, vol. i. p. 242.) The differ­ence of position in the ancient geographers may beaccounted for by the fact that Musama must havebeen on the boundary between Gedrosia and Cara­mania. Ptolemy speaks of a tribe, whom he callsMusarnaei {Movaapvaiot, vi. 21. § 4). There canbe little doubt that they were the people who livedaround Musarna. [^*] MUSO'NES (Amm.

It appears to hiivecertainly existed previous to the conquest of thispart of Italy by the Humans, and was not impro­bably of Etruscan origin. Livy tells us, that thedistrict or territory in which it was situated, wastaken from the Boians, and had previously belongedto the Etruscans (Liv. xxxix. 55); but he doesnot mention the city. Nor do we know at whatperiod the latter felt into the hands of the Romans,though it was probably during the Gaulish War(n.c. 225—222), as we find it in their undisturbed

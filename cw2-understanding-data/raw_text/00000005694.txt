For Homer, being well acquainted withthe misfortune of Linus, fays that Vulcan represented,among other things, in the shield of Achilles, a boy play­ing on a harp, aiid singing the fate of Linus: "To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,Whole fender ky the fate of Linus sings." But Pamphus, who composed the most ancient hymns forthe Athenians, fays, that grief for the death of Linus in­creased to that degree, that he came to be called Oitolinos,or lamentable Linus. And afterwards the Lesbian Sappho,having learnt the name Oitolinos from the verses of Pam­phus, celebrates in her poems Adonis and Oitolinos. TheThebans too boast that Linus was buried in their coun­try; and they fay, that after the loss of the Greeks atChæronea, Philip the son of Amyntas, in consequence ofa vision in a dream, brought the bones of Linus to Mace­donia ; and afterwards, from another dream, carried backthe bones to Thebes. The covering however of this tomb,and every thing else belonging to it, have, they say, beenobliterated through length of time. The Thebans like­wise assert, that there was a junior Linus, the son os Isme-'nius; and that when but a boy he was slain by Hercules,whom he instructed in music. However, neither theLinus the son of Amphimarus, nor he who was the son ofIsmenius, composed any tlung in verse; or, if they did, ithas not been transmitted to posterity. Vol. III. F CHAP.

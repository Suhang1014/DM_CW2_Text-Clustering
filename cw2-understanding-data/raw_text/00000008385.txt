Terglou^ and hasfrom thence :i course of above 75 miles to the sea,which it enters at the inmost bight of the Adriatic,between Aquileia and the Timavus. It receives atthe present day the waters of the Natisone andTorre, the ancient Natiso and Turris, both of whichin ancient times pursued independent courses to the.sea under the walls of Aquileia, and from the, E.tlmse of the Wippach or Vipao, called by the ancientsthe Fluvius Frioidus, Though so important astream, the name of the Sontius is not mentioned byany of the geographers; but it is found in the Tabula,which places a station nailed Ponte Sonti (Ad PontemSon lit) 14 miles from Aquileia on the highroad toAemona (LaybacK). This bridge, which lay on themain entrance into Italy on this side, was a militarypoint of considerable importance. It checked for atime the march of the emperor Maximin whenadvancing upon Aquileia, in a. i>. 238 (Herodian,viii. 4; Capit. Maximin. 22); and at a later periodit was here that Odoaccr took up his position tooppose the advance of Theodosius, l>y whom he was,liowever, defeated in a decisive battle, A. J>. 489(Cassiod. Citron, p. 472; Id. Var. i. 18; Jornand.Gtt. 57). The Sontius is correctly described byHerodian, though he does not mention its name, as alarge and formidable stream, especially in spring andsummer, when it is fed by the melting of the Alpinesnows. [E.H.B.] SONUS (2vros, Arrian, Tnd. c. 4; Pirn. vi. 18.8. 22), a principal affluent of the Ganges, whichflows in a NE. direction to it from the VmdhyaMountains. lis modern name is Sonne. There isno doubt that it has been contracted from the San­scrit Suvarna, golden. The Soaa (2^ai) of Ptolemy(vii. 1. § 30) is certainly the same river.

Itscapital was Carcatbiocerta. (Strab. xi. pp. 521,522, 527.) It formed at one time, with the neigh­bouring districts, a separate west Armenian kingdom,governed by the Sophenian Artanes, but was annexedto the east Armenian kingdom by Tigranes. So-pliene was taken away from Tigranes by Pompey.(Strab. xi. p. 532; Dion Cass, xxxvi. 2lj; Plut.Lucnll. 24, Pomp, 33.) Nero gave Sophene as aseparate kingdom to Soli senilis. (Tac. Ann. xiii. 7.)

Though included in Latium in the moreextended sense of that term, as it was understoodunder the Roman Empire, Sora was originally aVolscian city (Liv. x. 1), and Apparently the mostnortherly possessed by that people. It was wrestedfrom them by the Romans in B.C. 345, being sur­prised by a sudden attack by the consuls FabinsDorso and Ser. Sulpicius. (Liv. vii. 28.)

[Rl'SIRAIIK.] THA'PSACUS (BduVaxos), a town of considerable'[iirum-c on the right bank of the Euphrates, in•I. 35° 15' N. It is mentioned very early inLia-ient history, and ia almost certainly tiie same ast Tiphuh, of the Old Testament (1 Kin/ft, iv. 24;n ifjr LXX. written 0aifa), which is mentioned usm i-astem boundary of the kingdom of Solomon,d-re ia some difference among ancient writers as to'<■ i rivince iu which it should be included. Thus,'mr (v. 24. a. 21) and Stephnnu* B.

At Thapsacus was the most<j"runt passage of the Euphrates in the northern<n«o of that river's course. As such, we read vts used by Cyrus the younger, whose annyrdod it, the water reaching up to their breasts, • n- being probably at that time no bridge. (Xen.mo. i. 4. § 11.) Some years later Dareius ■ ^<\! it to meet Alexander in Cilicia, ami rccrossedin Lute after his defeat at Issus. (Arrian, ii. 13.) blander, pursuing Dareius, crossed the river also'lie same spot, as the historian especially notices, two bridges (probably of boats), which wereire J together (iii. 7). Strabo, who makes frequent l>.o of Thapsacus, considers it, on the authorityI r itosthenes, as distant from llabylon about 4800ma, and from Cominagene 2000 (ii. pp. 77, 78, in. p. 746); and states that it was situated'. that sjiot where Mesopotamia is the widest). There is no doubt that it derived its name 'a Semitic verb, meaning to pass over (Winer,H iTtcrb. $. r.): hence another passage-place • i r unie name, which ia mentioned in 2 A'tn^s,10. but which is really in Palestine, has been m confounded with Tiphsah on the Euphrates. / states that the name was changed by tho*'.Ionian Greeks to Amphipulis (v. 24. s. 21),: .Nrtitanus calls the Ampliipolis of Seleucns Tour-■U. No trace of any of these names is now found:he cnontry (Ritler, x. p. 1114). nor any ruinsif can certainly be identified with its site. It was,"rver, probablv near the present Ittir.

It has been conjectured hy Mannert(v. 2. p. 233) that the name is a mistake forCharrana, another form of Charrae; but this hypo­thesis seems hardly tenable, lteichard believes it isrepresented by the present braids). [V.] THAItRAS(ed#«, Ptol.: Ru. at Capo del Sero).a city of Sardinia, mentioned only by Ptolemy (wherethe name is written iu many MSS. and editionsTarrae or Tan-as) and in the Itineraries, but whichseems to have been one of the most considerableplaces in the island. It was situated on the W.coast, on a projecting point of land at the N. ex­tremity of the Gulf of Oristano, where its ruinsare still visible, though half buried in sand, andnumerous minor antiquities have been discovered.Prom its position there can be little doubt that itwas a Phoenician or Carthaginian settlement; butcontinued to be a considerable town under the Ro­mans, and an inscription records the repair of theroad from Tharru to Comus as late as the reignof the emperor Philip. (l)e la Marmora, 1'oy. ruSardaipu, vol. ii. pp. 359, 477.) The AntonineItinerary correctly places it 18 miles from Coniusand 12 from Oilioca (Ihriitanu). (/tin. Ant. p. 84;Ptol. iii. 3. § 8.) [E. H.

According to lteichard, Etatakta now oc­cupies its site. [J. R] THASOS (8ttVor, sometimes SoWof: Kth.Barrios: Thato or 7'asso), an island in the N. ofthe Aegacan sea, off the coast of Thrace, and dis­tant only 3\ miles from the plain of the riverNcstns or Kara-Su. It was distant half a day'ssail from Amphipnlis (Thuc. iv. 104), and 32 milesfrom Abdera. (Plin. iv. 12. s. 23.) It was u1m>called Aerin or Aethra (Plin. /. c; Steph. II. s. r.)and Chryse, from its gold mines (Eustath. adOionys. Per. 517), which were the chief source ofthe prosperity of the island. The earliest knowninhabitants of Thasos were the Phoenicians, whowere doubtless attracted to the island by its valu­able mines, but who are said to have come thitherin search of Europe, five generations More thebirth of the Grecian Hercules. They were led byThasos, the son of Agenor, from whom the islandderived its name. (Herod, ii. 44, vi. 47; Paus. v.25. § 12; Scymn. 660; Conon, c 37; Steph. It.$. «.) Thasos was afterwards colonised in Ol. l.r>or 18 (n.c. 720 or 708) by settlers from Paros, ledby Tilcsicles, the father of the poet Arclulorhus.(Thuc. iv. 104; Strab. ix. p. 487; Clem. Alex.Strom, i. p. 144; Euseb. Prarp. />. vi. 7.) Therealso existed nt that time in tlie island a Thraciantribe called Saians, with whom the Parian settlerscarried on war, hut not always successfully; and onono occasion Archilochus was obliged to throw awayhis shield. (Archiloch. Fragm. 5, ed. Schneidewin;Arisloph. Pac. 1298, with the Nchnl.) The (Ircekcolony rapidly rose in power, and obtained valuablepos>c*sions on the adjoining mainland, which con­tained even richer mines than those in the islam).Shortly before the Persian invasion, the clear sur­plus revenue of the Thasians was 200, and some­times even 300 talents yearly (46,000/., 66.000/.),of which Scapte Hy 1C |iroduced 80 talents, ami I liemines in the island rather less.

Now the stones that were cast were of the weightof a talent, and were carried two furlongs and farther. Theblow they gave was no way to be sustained, not only by thosethat stood first in the way, but by those that were beyondthem for a great space. As for the Jews, they at firstwatched the coming of the stone, for it was of a white color,and could, therefore, not only be perceived by the greatnoise it made, but could be seen also before it came by itsbrightness: accordingly, the watchmen that sat upon thetowers gave them notice when the engine was let go, and thestone came from it, and cried out aloud, in their own countrylanguage, The son cometh :' so those that were in its way 1 What should be the meaning of this signal or watehword, when thewatchmen saw a stone coming from the engine, The son cometh, or whatmistake there is in the reading, I cannot tell.

Dio also lets us knowthat the very Romans at Rome pronounced the name of Simon, the son ofGioras, Bar Boras for Bar Gioras, as we learn from Xiphiline, p. 217.lleland takes notice, "That many will here look for a mystery, as thoughthe meaning were that the Son of God came now to take vengeance on thesins of the Jewish nation," which is, indeed, the truth of the fact, buthardly what the Jews could now mean; unless, possibly by way of derisionof Christ's threatenings so often made, that he would come at the head ofthe Roman army for their destruction But even this interpretation has

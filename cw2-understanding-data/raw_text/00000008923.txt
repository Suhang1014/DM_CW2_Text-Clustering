The third temple, which is at some distancefrom the other two, nearer to the X. pate of thetown, and is commonly known as the Temple ofCeres or Vesta (though there is no reason for eithername), is much smaller that) the other two, beingonly 108 feet in length by -18 in breadth: it presentsno remarkable architectural peculiarities, but is, aswell as the so-called Jlasilica, of much later datethan the greet temple. Mr. Wilkin*, indeed, wouldassign them both to the Koman period: but it is dif­ficult to reconcile this with the history of the city,which never appear! to have been a place of muchimportance under the Koman rule. (Swinburne'sTravels, yah ii. pp. 131 —138; WUkins's MagnaGraecia, pp. 55—(17.) The oilier remains are of little importance. Thevestiges of an amphitheatre exist near the centreof the city; aud not far from them are thefallen ruins of a fourth temple, of small size andclearly of Human date. Kxcavations have also laidbare the foundations of many houses and other build­ings, and the traces of a portico, which appear toindicate the site of the ancient forum. The remainsof an aqueduct are also visible outside the walls;and numerous tombs (some of which are said to beof much interest) have been recently brought to nght. PLAH OF I'AESTCM. A.

The small river which (as already noticed byStrabo), by stagnating under the walls of Paestom,rendered its situation so unhealthy, is now called theSulso: its ancient name is not mentioned. It formsextensive deposits of a calcareous stone, resemblingthe Roman travertin, which forms an excellentbuilding material, with which both the walls andedifices of the city have been constructed. The ma­laria, which caused the site to be wholly abandonedduring the middle ages, has already sensibly dimi­nished, since the resort of travellers has again at­tracted a small population to the spot, aud givenrise to some cultivation. About five miles from Faestum, at the mouthof the Silarui or Sete, stood, in ancient Umea, a cele­brated temple of Juno, which, according to the tra­dition adopted both by Strabo ami Pliny, was foundedby the Argonauts under Jason (Strab. vi. p. 252; Plin. iii. 5. s. 10).

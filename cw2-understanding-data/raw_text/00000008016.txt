Without theTowel points, the name will represent the powerfulami warlike tril>e whom the Greeks call Pharusii.Tiie similarity of the names seems to have given rise-to the strange story which Sallust (Ji.J. 18) copiedfrom the Tunic books, that Hercules had led anarmy of Persians into Africa. (" Pharusii quondamPersae." Plin. v. 8; com p. Pump. Mela, iii. 10, § 3.)The fierce tribes of Africa thus furnished the Phoe­nicians with inexhaustible supplies of mercenarytroops, as they afterwards did to Carthage.

The name seems still to haveexisted in the middle ages, for Broeardus, qxiotcd byJvobinson, speaks of a village named Phasellum,situated a league N. of J)uk, and corresponding totin; position of El-Attjek, where there are ruins.(Kobinson, Ti'tblieal Researches^ vol. ii. p. 305.) PHASE'LIS (*I»a(TTj\ij: 4»a(T7)A.(Tij5). a ma­ritime town of Eyeia, on the Painphylian gulf,whence some say that it was u town of Painpbylia(Plin. v. 36; Steph. B. * v.; Dionys. Per. 855;Stadiam. Mar. May. § 205); but Strabo (xiv. p.667) distinctly informs us that Phasclis belongedto Lyeia. and that Olbia was the first Painphyliantown on the coast. The town was a Doriancolony (Herod, ii. 178), situated on a headland,and conspicuous to those sailing from Cilicia tolihodes. (Lit. xxxvii. 23; Cic. in Verr. ii. 4.)Behind it rose a mountain of the same name, pro­bably the same which is elsewhere called ret 2<i\t'^a(Stadias*. Mar. Mag. § 204; Strab. xiv. p. 666);and in its vicinity there was a lake and a inountain-pnss leading between Mount Climax and the sea-coast into Pamphylia. Phaselis had three harbours,and rose to a high degree of prosjierity, though itdid not belong to the political confederacy of theother Lycian towns, but formed an independent stateby itself. It is mentioned by Thucydides (ii. 69,comp. via. 88, 89; Polyb. xsx. 9) as a place ofsome importance to the commerce of the Athenianswitli Phoenicia and Cilicia. At a later period, havingbecome the haunt of the pirates, it w:is attaekedand taken by Servilius Isauricus. (Cits in Verr.iv. 10; Eutrop. vi. 3; Vlor. iii. 6.) Although itwas restored after this disaster, yet it never reco­vered its ancient prosperity; and Lucan (viii. 249.&C.) describes it as nearly deserted when visited byPoinpey in his flight from Pbarsalus. According toAthenaeus (xiv. p. 688) the town was celebratedfor the manufacture of rose-perfume, and Nicunder{op. A then. p. 683) praised its roses. It was thecommon opinion among tlie ancients that the pha­se! i (<fHiai}\oi), a kind of light sailing boats, wereinvented at Phaselis, whence all the coins of thetown show the image of such a boat. Pausanias (iii. 3. § 6) reports that the spear of Attutawas exhibited in the temple of Allien* it lk*.selis. In Hi erodes (p. 683) the name of the peais corrupted into Phasydes; and the Acts of 0»cils show it to have been toe see 4 a biik'p. ftmay also be remarked that Phasclis was the txok-place of Theodeetes, a tragic poet and rtn-tcnciai «fsome note. (Steph. B. $. v.; comp. Scvlax. jl 31;Ptol. v. 3. § 3, 5. § 2; Eckhel, Doct'r. .W S,p. 6.) There are still considerable remains ol tftejancient Phaselis.

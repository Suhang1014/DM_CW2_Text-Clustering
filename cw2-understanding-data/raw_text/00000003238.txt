The conflict of Rome and Persia was prolongedfrom the death of Crassus to the reign of Heraclius.An experience of seven hundred years might con­vince the rival nations of the impossibility of main­taining their conquests beyond the fatal limits of theTigris and Euphrates. Yet the emulation of Trajanand Julian was awakened by the trophies of Alex­ander, and the sovereigns of Persia indulged theambitious hope of restoring the empire of Cyrus.Such extraordinary efforts of power and courage willalways command the attention of posterity; but theevents by which the fate of nations is not materiallychanged leave a faint impression on the page ofhistory, and the patience of the reader would beexhausted by the repetition of the same hostilities,undertaken without cause, prosecuted without glory,and terminated without effect. The arts of negotia­tion, unknown to the simple greatness of the senateand the Caesars, were assiduously cultivated by theByzantine princes; and the memorials of their per­petual embassies* repeat, with the same uniformprolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation, • See the embassies of Menander, extracted and preserved in the tenth centuryby the order of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.

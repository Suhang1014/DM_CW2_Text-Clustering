Without being able to define the position of thistribe, or to state their relations to the Aethiopians ofMeroe, we shall perhaps not err in placing them onthe nine Nile [AstafI's], and in the neighbour­hood of Axume. The geographers (Heeren, &c.)who describe the Sembritae as dwelling near theWhite Nile, have forgotten both their vicinity toArabia — i. e. the eastern portion of Meroe — and tliecharacter of the regions which the Astapus andAstuboras respectively water. The White Kile flowsthrough lagoons and morasses unsuited for townsand permanent settlements; while the Blue Nile busalways had on its hanks a numerous population,dwelling in large villages and towns. Along theBine Nile ran the principal highways of the tradeof Aegypt with Southern Aetbiopia, while the WhiteNile led off to the uncivilised and scattered tribesof the Libyans. The Sembritae, if seated on thelatter river, would probably have eluded observationaltogether; whereas on the former they would be aswell known to the caravans and their guides as anyother of the Aethiopian races. Moreover, the meso-putamian districts suited to towns he to the east ofAethiopia Proper, and would allbrd a secure retreatto the refugees from Aegypt in search of a new ha­bitation. (See Cooley's Claudius Ptolemy and theNile, pp. 7—27.) The present Stnaar eorrespmdsnearly with the territory of the Sembritae.

E. p. 20. ed.Huds.) and by Marcian {Peripl. M. Ext. c. 27, ed.Mtiller, 1855), who states that it was opposite toJit. Pasabo, in Arabia, and that these two moun­tains, with their promontories, form the straits atthe entrance of the gulf of Persia. Ptolemy speaksof it, and states that it was also called Strongylus,probably from its fVrin (vi. 8. § 11). Its modernname appears to be Elbourz. (Vincent, Voyage ofXearchus, i. p. 319—321.) [V.] SEMNOXES (2*jUfwi'es or 2,cp.vov*s\ or per­haps more correctly Scnnones, are described asthe most ancient and illustrious among the Sueviin the north of Germany. They dwelt between theAlbis and Viadus, being surrounded on the west bythe Cherusei, on the south by the Silingi, on theeast by the Manimi and Burgundiones, and on thenorth-west by the Longobardi. (Tac. Germ. 39;Ptol. ii. 11. §5 15, 17; Veil. Pat. ii. 10G.)Their country accordingly extended from the hillsof Lumtia in the south, as far as Potsdam inthe north, and in it they formed 100 commu­nities {pagi), which gave them such strengththat they regarded themselves as the head of theSuevi. Their country contained an ancient forest(Scmnonum Silva), hallowed by awful superstitionand sacrificial rite.-.; at stated seasons deputies fromall the kindred tribes met in it, and commencedtheir proceedings with a human sacrifice. No one,moreover, was allowed to enter this forest except liewas bound in chains, a mark of humiliation in thepresence "f the god; and if any one stumbled he wasnot permitted to rise, but had to crawl alone. Asto the history of the Semitones, we learn from Ta­citus {Ann. ii. 45) and Strabo (v». p. 290) that inthe time of Augustus they were united with theMarcomanni under MaroboduuH.

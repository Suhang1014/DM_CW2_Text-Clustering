A similar but far less justifiable decree—theproposal, directed against Marcus Octavius, that whoeverhad been deprived of his office by decree of the peopleshould be for ever incapable of filling a public post^—wasrecalled by Gracchus at the request of his mother; and hewas thus spared the disgrace of openly mocking justice bylegalizing a notorious violation of the constitution, and oftaking base vengeance on a man- of honour, who had notspoken an angry word against Tiberius and had only actedconstitutionally and in accordance with what he conceivedto be his duty.

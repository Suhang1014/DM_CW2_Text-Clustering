Of these placeswe know only thp position of Bolina and Argyra.Bolina was a little S. of the promontory Drepanum,and pave its name to the river liolinaeus. (Pans. vii.24. ^ 4.) Argyra was a little S. of the promontoryBhitiin. (Pans. vii. 23. § I.) Patrae continued aninsignificant town clown to the time of Augustus,although it is frequently mentioned as the place atwhich persons landed going from Italy to Greece.(Cut. ad Fam. vii. 2S. xvi. 1, 5, 6, ad Att. v. 9, vii.2.) After the battle of Pharsalia (B.C. 48) Patraewas taken posses.-.inn of by Cato, but shortly after­wards surrendered to Calenus, Caesars lieutenant.It was here also that Antony passed the winter(32—31) when preparing for the war against Au­gustus; and it was taken by Agrippn shortly beforethe battle of Actium. (Dion Cass. xlii. 13. 14. I 9,13.) It owed its restoration to Augustus, who re­solved after the battle of Actium to establish twoRoman colonies on the western coast of Greece, andfor this purpose made choice of Nicopolis and Patrae.Augustus colonised at Patrae a considerable body ofhis soldiers, again collected its inhabitants from thesurrounding village-;, and added to them those ofIt hypes. (Pans. vii. 18. § 7; 1 * J in. iv. 5.) He notonly gave Patrae dominion over the neighbouringtowns, such as Pharae (Pans. wi. 22. § 1), Pyme(Pans. vii. 17. § 5), Tritaea (Pans. vii. 23. § 6), buteven over Locris. (Paus. x. 38. § 9.) On coins itappears as a Roman colony with the name of CoioniaAiujusta Aroi Patrentis. Strabo describes it in histime as a populous place with a good anchorage,andPau.-anias has devoted four chapters to an accountof its public buildings. (Strab. viii. p. 387; Pans. vii.18—21.) Of these the most important appear tohave been a temple of Artemis Laphria, on the acro­polis, with an ancient statue of this goddess, removedfrom Calydon to Patrae by order of Augustus, andin whose honour an annual festival was celebrated;the Odeum, which was the most magnificent build­ing of the kind in Greece, after the Odeum of He-rodes at Athens; the theatre; and on the seaside atemple of Demeter, which was remarkable on accountof a well in front of it, which was supposed to fore­tell the fate of sick persons; a mirror was suspendedon the water, and on this mirror there were certainappearances indicating whether the person wouldlive or die. In the time of Paus&nias Patrae wasnoted for its manufacture of byssus or flax, whichwas grown in El is. and was woven at Patrae into head­dresses (KCKp{xfta\oi) and garments. Women wereemployed in this manufacture, and so large was theirnumber that the female population was double that ofthe male; and as a natural consequence there wasgreat immorality in the town. (Pans. vii. 21. § 14.) Patrae has continued down to the present day tobe one of the most important towns in the Aforea,being admirably situated for communicating withItaly and the Adriatic, and with eastern Greece bymeans of the gulf of Corinth. It is frequently men­tioned in the Byzantine writers. In a.k. 347 therewas an archbishop of Patrae at the council of Sar-dica. In the sixth century it was destroyed by anearthquake. (Piocop. G<>th. iv. 25.) It is subse­quently mentioned as a dukedom of the Byzantineempire; it was sold to the Venetians in I 108; wastaken by the Turks in 1446; was recovered by theVenetians ic 1533; hut was shortly afterwardstaken aejain by the Turks, and remained in theirhands till the Greek revolution. ] The country around Patras is a fin* vr\ kefiplain, and produces at present a l&rz* q«vr.ti icurrants, which form an article of eipjft.

So Antigonus suspecting no treach­ery, but depending on the good-will of his brother, came toAristobulus armed, as he used to be, with his entire armour,in order to show it to him; but when he was come at a placewhich was called Strato's Tower, where the passage happenedto be exceeding dark, the guards slew him; which death of hisdemonstrates that nothing is stronger than envy and calumny,and that nothing does more certainly divide the good-will andnatural affections of men than those passions. But here onemay take occasion to wonder at one Judas, who was of the sectof tlie Essens, and who never missed the truth in his predictions;for this man when he saw Antigonus passing by the temple,cried out to his companions and friends, who abode with himas his * scholars, in order to learn the art of foretelling things tocome, "That it was good for him to die now, since he had"spoken falsely about Antigonus, who is still alive, and I see"him passing by, although he had foretold he should die at"the place called Strato's Tower, that very day, while yet the"place is six hundred furlongs off, where he had foretold he"should be slain; and still this day is a great part of it already"past, so that he was in danger of proving a false prophet."As he was saying this, and that in a melancholy mood, thenews came that Antigonus was slain in a place under ground,which itself was called also Strato's Tower, or of the same namewith that Cesarea which is seated at the sea. This event putthe prophet into a great disorder. 3. But Aristobulus repented immediately of this slaughter ofhis brother, on which account his disease increased upon him,and he was disturbed in his mind, upon the guilt of such wick­edness, insomuch that his entrails were corrupted by his intol­erable pain, and he vomited blood: at which time one of theservants that attended upon him, and was carrying his bloodaway, did, by divine providence, as I cannot but suppose, slipdown and shed part of his blood at the very place where therewere spots of Antigonus' blood there slain, still remaining;and when there was a cry made by the spectators, as if the ser­vant had on purpose shed the blood on that place, Aristobulusheard it and inquired what the matter was? And as theydid not answer him, he was the more earnest to know what it * Hence we learn that the Essens pretended to have rules whereby men mightforeteli things to come, and that this Judas the Essen, taught those rules to hisscholars; but whether their pretences were of an astrological or magical nature,which yet in such religious Jews, who were utterly forbidden such ans, is no wayprobable, or to any Bath Col, spoken of by the latter Rabbins, or otherwise, I can­not tell.

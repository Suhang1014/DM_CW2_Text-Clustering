This was there­fore one of the great highroads leading to Gaul.But the stations on it, as given in the Tabula, arevery confused, ami can only partially be. restored bythe assistance of the Antonine Itinerary, which no­where gives this road in its entirety. At Ticinum itwas joined by another road leading from Mediolanumto that city. The stations, xs given m the JerusalemItinerary (p. are as follows :— Ticinum Durii (Z)omo) - - xii. m. p Laumellum (A/htujZZo) IX. Ad Cottiaa (Qczo) - - - xii. Ad Medias xiii.

The rest of the route over the Cottian Alps is givenin the article Ali»es. [E. H. B.] VIA AEMILIA SCAURI, is the name given, forthe sake of distinction, to a road which was con­structed by Aeinilius Scaurus long after the morecelebrated Via Aemilia above described. Strabo,the only anther who distinctly mentions the two,says that Aemiiins Scaurus, after having drained themarshes on the S. hide of tlie l'adus, constructed theAemilian Way through l'isae and Luna as far as Sa-bata, and thence through Dertona. (Strab. v. p. 217.)Whether " the other Aemilian Way," as Strabo callsit, had been already continued from Placentia toDertona, or this also was tir>t effected by Scaurus,we know not; but it is clear that the two werethus brought into connection. The construction ofthis great work must he assigned to the censorshipot M. A' milius Scaurus, in B.C. 109, as we learn fromAmelias Victor( Vir. III. 72), who, however, probablyconfounds it with the more celebrated Via Aemiliafrom Placentia to Ariniinum. But a comparison ofthe two authors leaves no doubt as to the road reallymeant. The name seems to have gradually falleninto disuse, probably on account of the ambiguityarising between the two Viae of the same name ; andwe rind both the coast-road from Pisae to VadaSabata, and that across the mountains from thelatter place by Aquae Statiellae to Dertona, includedby the Itineraries as a part of the Via Aurelia, ofwhich the former at least was in fact a mere conti­nuation. Hence it will be convenient to discuss thestations and distances along these lines, under thegeneral head ot Via AliREiJA. [E. H. B.] VIA AMERINA, is the name given in an in­scription of the time of Hadrian (Orell. Inter. 3306)to a line of road, which must obviously be that lead­ing direct from Rome to Ameria. Tins', as we learnfrom the Tabula, branched off from the Via Cassiaat Baccanae (Baccano), and proceeded through Ne-pete and Falerii to Ameria.

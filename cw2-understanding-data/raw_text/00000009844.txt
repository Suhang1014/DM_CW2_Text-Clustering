OCR Output THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. BOOK IV. YEAR VII—BEFORE CHRIST 425. THE ensuing summer, when the corn was beginning toear, ten sail of Syracusan, joined by an equal number of Lo-erian vessels, at the invitation of the inhabitants, stood awayfor Messenein Sicily, and took possession of the place. Andthus Messene revolted from the Athenians. But this eventwas chiefly owing to the practices of the Syracusans ; who,foreseeing that this town might open the way for the re­duction of Sicily, were greatly afraid lest the Atheniansshould get established there, and with augmented forcespour out from thence upon them. The Locrians assisted outof enmity to the Rhegians, whom they were desirous to haveit in their power to attack both by land and sea. At thesame time also these Locrians broke in upon the territory ofthe Rhegians with their intire force, to deter them from anyattempt to save Messene, and to gratify also those fugitivesfrom Rhegium, who acted now in combination with them.For Rhegium had for a long time been embroiled in sedition,and so was unable to take the field against these invaders,who for the same reason were more eager to distress them.When the ravage was compleated, the Locrians marchedtheir land-forces back, but their ships were stationed on theguard of Messene. They also were very busy in the equip­ment of an additional number, which were to repair to thatstation, and be ready to move from thence to any futureoperations of war.

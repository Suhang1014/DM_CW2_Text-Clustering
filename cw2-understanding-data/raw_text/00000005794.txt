OCR Output no THE DESCRIPTION is about seven stadia in circumference. While I was sur­veying it, those verses of Homer respecting Tityus cameinto my mind, in which he calls the city of the Pano-peans Callichoros, or delighting in the dance. I likewise re­collected, that in the contest for the dead body of Pa-troclus, he fays, that Schedius the son of Iphitus, and kingof the Phocenses, who was slain by Hector, dwelt inPanopeus. It appears to me, that the cause of his dwellinghere was his fear of the Bœotians (for Phocis in this partis very much exposed to the attacks of the Bœotians),and that he used Panopeus as a place of defence. I was*iot however able to conjecture why Homer called Pano­peus Callichoros, till I learnt the reason from those Athe­nians who are called Thyades. These Thyades are Atticwomen, who every year come to Parnassus, and, togetherwith Delphic women, celebrate the orgies of Bacchus.It is an established custom with the Thyades, to formchoirs in the road from Athens, in other places, and amongthe Panopcans. Homer, therefore, by the appellationPanopeus, appears to signify the choir of the Thyades. In the public road of the Panopeans there is a buildingof crude tiles, and in it a statue of Pentelican stone, whichsome say is the statue of Æsculapius, and others of Pro­metheus. These last think their opinion is confirmedfrom hence : Near the chasm formed by the torrent, thereare stones of such a magnitude that each is sufficient toload a cart. These stones are of the colour of clay, yetnot of such clay as is dug out of the earth, but of suchas is found among the gravel of rivers and torrents. Thesestones too smell very much like a human body \ and theysay that these are the remains of that clay, from whichthe whole race of mankind was fashioned by Prometheus. In

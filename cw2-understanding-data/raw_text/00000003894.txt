II.] AGAINST APION. 423 for the proper way of confuting fools is not to use bare words,but to appeal to the things themselves that make against them.Now then, all such as ever saw the construction of our tem足ple, of what nature it was, knew well enough how the purityof it was never to be profaned; for it had four several courts,1encompassed with cloisters round about, every one of whichhad, by our law, a peculiar degree of separation from therest. Into the first court every body was allowed to go, evenforeigners, and none but women, during their courses, wereprohibited to pass through it; all the Jews went into the se足cond court, as well as their wives, when they were free fromall uncleanness; into the third court went in the Jewish men,when they were clean and purified; into the fourth went thepriests, having on their sacerdotal garments ; but for the mostsacred place, none went in but the high-priests, clothed intheir peculiar garments. Now there is so great caution usedabout these offices of religion, that the priests are .appointedto go into the temple but at certain hours; for in the morn足ing, at the opening of the inner temple, those that are toofficiate receive the sacrifices, as they do again at noon, tillthe doors are shut. Lastly, it is not so much as lawful tocarry any vessel into the holy house; nor is there any thingtherein but the altar [of incense,] the table [of show-bread,]the censer, and the candlestick, which are all written in thelaw; for there is nothing farther there, nor are there anymysteries performed that may not be spoken of; nor is thereany feasting within the place.

B.; Panticapenses, Plin. vi.7: A'eriVA), an important Greek city, situated inthe Tauric Chersonesus on the western side of theCimmerian Bosporus, and not far from the entranceto the Lucus Maeotis. (Strab. vii. p. 309; Appian,Mithr. 107.) Scylax says (p. 30, Huds.) thatPanticnpaeum was 30 stadia from the Maeotis.which is too short a distance; but Arrian (Peripl.§ 29, p. 20, Hods.) more correctly makes the dis­tance 60 stadia from Pantica[iaeum to the mouth ofthe Tanais, the Maeotis being regarded by thiswriter as a continuation of the Tanais, and the Bos­porus as the mouth of the latter. According toSteph. B. (ff. r.) Panticapaeum derived its namefrom & river Panticapes; but this is a mistake ofthe learned Byzantine, who appears to have recol­lected the river of this name mentioned by Herodo­tus, and therefore connected it with the city Panti­capaeum, which, however, does not stand upon anyriver. Ammianus also erroneously places it on theHypanis (xxii. 8. § 26). According to a traditionpreserved by Stephanus («. t>.) it was founded by ason of Aeetes, who received the district as a pre­sent from the Scythian king Agaetes; but weknow from history that it was a Milesian colony,and apparently one of the earliest on this coast.(Strab. vii. p. 309; Plin. iv. 12. s. 26.) Ammianus{I. c.) calls it the mother of all the Milesian townson the Bosporus; but the date of its foundation can­not be determined. Bockh (Inscr. vol. ii. p. 91)places it about 01. 59. 4 (b. c. 541), and it mustcertainly have been earlier than 01. 75.1 (b. C.480), which is the date asMgned to it by Niebulir.(KUine Schrift. vol. i. p. 373.) The Greeks con­nected the name Panticapaeum with the god Pan,whose figure, or that of a Satyr, frequently appearson the coins of the city; but this name, as well asthat of the river Panticapes, probably belonged tothe Scythian language, and was, as in simitar casta,adopted by the Greeks with an Hellenic termination. Panticapaeum was the capital of the kings ofBosporus (Strab. xi. p. 495; Diod. xx. 24), of whoma brief account is given elsewhere. [Vol. I. p. 422. jAccordingly Panticapaeum was frequently called Bos­porus, though the latter name was also given to thewhole kingdom. Hence, when Demosthenes says thatTheudosia was reckoned by many as good a harbouras Bosporus, he evidently means by the latter thecapital and not the kingdom {inLe.pt. p. 467); anilaccordingly Pliny expressly says (iv. 12. s. 24) thatPanticapieum was called Bosporus by some. Eu-tropius (vii. 9) erroneously makes Panticapaeumand Bosporus two different cities. Under the By­zantines Bosporus became the ordinary name of thecity (Procop. de Aedif. iii. 7, B. Pera. i. 12. B.Gvth. iv. 5); and among the inhabitants of the

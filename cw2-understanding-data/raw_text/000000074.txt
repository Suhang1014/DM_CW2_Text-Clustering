OCR Output GOLD CROWNS. 27 9. HOW FREQUENTLY THE APPELLATION OF THE KNIGHTSWAS CHANGED. The appellation of the knights has been frequently changed,even with respect to those who have been admitted into the order.Under Romulus and the kings, they were called Celeres, thenFlexumines, and afterwards Trossuli, because, without any as足sistance from the infantry, they took a town of that name inTuscany, which was nine miles on this side of the Volcinii: thisname remained until after the time of C. Gracchus. Junius, in足deed, who, on account of his friendship with Gracchus, was calledGracchanus, has left these words in writing: " as for what belongsto the equestrian order, they were formerly named Trossuli, andare now called Equites, (knights) because they are not acquaintedwith the meaning of the name, and many of them are ashamedto be called Trussuli."3 10. OF MILITARY DONATIONS IN BOTH GOLD AND SILVER. There are some other distinctions in the use of gold which mustnot be omitted. Allies and foreigners were presented with goldchains, while citizens had only silver ones; and besides, braceletswere given to citizens, which was not done to foreigners. 11. WHEN THE FIRST GOLD CROWN WAS PRESENTED. Crowns of gold were likewise given to the citizens, a circum足stance which is more remarkable. I have not been able to learnwho it was that first received one of them. We are however toldby L. Piso, that it was first presented by A. Posthumius, thedictator, upon the capture of the camp of the Latins, at the LakeRegillus; he gave, out of the plunder, the crown in question toan individual who had particularly signalized himself on the occa足sion. The consul L. Lentulus likewise gave one of 5 lbs. weightto Serg. Corn. Merenda, on taking the town of the Samnites. Piso,surnamed the Thrifty, presented his son with a crown, out of hisown property, and he left it to him by an especial bequest. 'See the note in Valpy, p. 4324.

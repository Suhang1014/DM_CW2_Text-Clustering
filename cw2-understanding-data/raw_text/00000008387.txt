Uicirnt, riurauvt), a townin Peloponnesus, was in the most ancient times thecapital of an independent district, called Pisatis(i) riio-am), which subsequently formed part of theterritory of Elis. It was celebrated in mythologyas the residence of Oenomaus and Pelops, and wasthe head of a confederacy of eight states, of which,besides Pisa, the following names are recorded: —Salmone, Heracleia, llarpinna, Cycebium, and Dys-pontium. (Strub. viii. p. 356, seq.) Pisa had ori­ginally the presidency of the Olympic festival, butwas deprived of this privilege by the Eleians. ThePisatans, however, made many attempts to recoverit; and the history of their wars with the-Eleians,which were at last terminated by the destruction ofPisa in B. c 572, is narrated elsewhere. [Ki.is,VoL I. p. 818, b.] Although Pisa ceased to existas a city from this time, the Pisatans, in conjunc­tion with the Arcadluns, celebrated the 104thOlympic festivid, u. c. 364. [See Vol. I, p. 819, b.]Pisa was said to have been founded by an epony­mous hero, Pibus, the son of Pcrieres, and grandsonof Aeolus (Paus. vi. 22. § 2); but others derivedits name from a fountain Pisa, (Strab. viii. p. 356;Eustath. ad Dionyt. Ptr. 409.) Modem writersconnect its name with lliaos. a low marshy ground,or with niooa, the name of the black fir or pine-tree. So completely was Pi.-a destroyed by theEleians, that the fact of its having existed was adisputed point in the time of Strabo (/. c); andPausanias found its site converted into a vineyard(vi. 22. § 1). Its situation, however, was perfectlywell known to Pindar and Herodotus. Pindar fre­quently identifies it with Olyinpia (c. g. 01. ii. 3);and Herodotus refers to Pisa and Olvnipia as tliesame point in computing the distance from the altarof the twelve gods at Athens (ii. 7). I'i-a appearsfrom Pausanias to have occupied a portion betweenHarpinna and Olympia, which were only 20 stadiaasunder (Lucian, oV Mort. l'eregr. 35); and theScholiast on Pindar (01. xi. 51) says that Pita wasonly 6 stadia from Olyiniiiu.

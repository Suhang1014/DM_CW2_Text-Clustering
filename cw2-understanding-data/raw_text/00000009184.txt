Ptolemy (vi. 4. § 2)and Ammianus (xxiii. 0) call it Rhocnmanis ('Po-yondvts), ami Marcianus (Pcripl. i. § 24, ed Muller)Rhogomanius {'Poyo^dytos). (Vincent, vol. i. p.401; Tlievenot, v. p. .535.)

[L.S.] RHOSOLOGIACUM or RHOSOLOGIA ('Po<ro-\oyia), a small place in the country of the Tecto-sa:;es in Galatia, on the road from Ancyra to Cae-sareia Mazaea, not far from the river Halys.

Miiller), a river of European Sarmaiiawhich took its source in the Alani Monies anddischarged itself into tiic Venedicus Sinus. Scha-farik (Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 4i»7) has identified itwith the Ih'tna, which, taking a direction generallyW., falls into the Gulf of Riga below Fort l>una-munde, after a course of 655 miles. This sameethnologist connects the mythic Eridanus, and tlietrees that wept amber, with tlit? Rhudon of Mar­cian (Rhubon appctis to In- a corrupted form),which Sabinus, a commentator upon Virpl, a. i>.1544, calls lihodanus. The amber could be broughtby land, or by water from the coasts where it wascollected to the Diina, and thence by boats con­veyed to the Bory.sthenes and the coasts of theEn Nine. The name *' Eri-danus," closely con­nected with Rhodanus, is composed of the words'• Rha" and "Don,'* roots which, in several of the In­do-European languages, signify " water,"1 *; river," asfor instance in '* Rha," the old n:tme for the Volga,and Danubius, Tanais, Danapris, Danastris, andthe like. [E. B. J.] RHUBRICATUS (PoufyUaTos, Ptol. iv. 3. § 5),a river of Numidia,. the same as tlie Luis of thePent. Tab., whu h flowed 5 M.P. to the E. of HippoRenins, now called the Sttboute (Barth, Waiuier-unffen. p. 70). [E. B. J.] RHU'DIAE or RU'DIAE ('PouSi'a, Ptol; 'P*5fai,Strab.: Eth. Rudinus: Rugge), an ancient city ofthe Salentines, in the interior of the Roman provinceof Calabria, and in tiie immediate vicinity of Lupiae(Lecce). (Strab. vi.p.281: Ptol.iii. l.§ 76.) Strabocalls it a Greek city (ttoAis 'EaatjWs); but we haveno other indication of this fact, and all the othernotices we find of it would lead u.s to infer that itwas a native Salentine or Messapian town. Underthe Romans it appears to have enjoyed municipalrank (an inscription has '; Municipes Rudini," Orell.3858); hut in other respects it was a place of littleimportance, arid derived its sole celebrity from thecircumstance of its heint; the birthplace of tlie poetEnnius. (Strab. I.e. Mel. ii. 4. § 7; Sil. Ital. xii.393; Cic. t/r Or. iii. 42.) That author is repeatedlytermed a Calabrian (Hor. Cam*, iv. 8; Ovid. A. A. iii. 409; Sil. Ital. I.e.; Acron, ad Hor. I r). nlthese passages confirm the accuracy of Pu* y.who assigns Rhudiae to the Salentines, it>i thfrrf-^to tlie Calabrians according- to the Roman as* <i '.'vname. Pliny and Mela, on tlie contrary, etriTi-n'fRudiae among the towns of the Pedicuh uteiawitli Barium and Egnatia, and the latter rubor ti-pressly excludes it from Calabria (Plin. hi. 11. a. 16;Mel. /. c ). But it seems impassible to TK&n> f^.istatement with that of Strabo, who pUees i: &uLnpiae, in the interior of the peninsula, oractual situation of Rudiae, which is clearly Mmti^cat a place still called Rugge.though n<iw aninhabfiftabout a mile from Lecce, where the inscnp^Ticited was discovered, as well as several <<li#r> in tbMessapian dialect, and many vases and other ^-f'^of antiquity. The identity of this place will '»municipal town of Rudiae can thermion? adnu; •*»doubt ; nor is there any reason to question the tn".that this was also tlie birthplace of Ennia: feeconsiderable confusion has ansen from th# rrr:nein the Tabula of a place called u Radae," a{daces 12 miles W. of Rubi, on the road to Ci:.c;cr^-As this place would have been within tbe am"? sthe Pediculi or Peucetii, it has been supps*:some writers to be the same with the Rikiia* a Tjsiand Mela, and therefore the birthplace A trx>fe;but tlie claims of Rugge to this distun-two 4>«runquestionable. (Galateo, de Sil. layyy. y>Tt\ fc*1manelli, vol. ii. pp. 93 —102; Mouunata,Ital DiaUkte, p. 58.)

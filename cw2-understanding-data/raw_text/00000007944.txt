Delphi by assassins said to have been hired by ,Perseus; yet at a later period lie favoured the causeof the Macedonian king, and thereby incurred the jill-will of the Romans. Pergamum was mainly in-'debted to Eumcnes II. for its embellishment andextension. He was a liberal patron of the arts andsciences; he decorated the temple of Zeus Niee-phorus, which had been built by Attalus outside thecity, with walks and plantations, and erected himselfmany other public buildings; but the greatest monu­ment of his liberality was the great library whichhe founded, and which yielded only to that of Alex­andria in extent and value. (Strab. lc; At hen. i.p. 3.) He was succeeded by his son Attalus II.;but the government was carried on by the lateking's brother Attalus, surnamed Philadelphus, fromb. c. 159 to 138. During this period the Per-gamenians again assisted the Etonians against thePseudo-Philip. Attains also defeated Dlegylis, kingof i he Tbracian Caeni, and overthrew Prusias ofHithynia. On his death, his ward and nephew,Attalus III., surnamed Philometor, undertook thereins of government, from B.C. 138 to 133, and onhis death bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans.Sniu after, Aristonicus, a natural son of Kumenes II..revolted and claimed the kingdom of Pergamum forhimself; but in B. c. 130 he was vanquished andtaken prisoner, and the kingdom of Pergamum be­came a Roman province under the name of Asia(Strab. /. c, xiv. p. 646.) The city of Pergamum,however, continued to flourish and prosper under theRoman dominion, so that Pliny (/. c.) could still callit 41 lon^e clarissimum Asiae Pergamum;" it re­mained the centre of jurisdiction for the district, andof commerce, as all the main-roads of Western Asiaconverged there. 1'ergainuin was one of the SevenChurches mentioned in the book of Revelations.Under the Byzantine emperors the greatness and pros­perity of the city declined; but it still exists underthe name of Bergamah, and presents to the visitornumerous ruins and extensive remains of its ancientmagnificence. A wall lacing the .south-oast of theacropolis, of hewn granite, is at least UK) feet deep,and engrafted into the rock; above it a course oi.large substructions forms a spacious area, uponwhich once rose a temple unrivalled in sublimity ofsituation, being visible from the vast plain and theAegean sea. The ruins of this temple show that itwas built in the noblest style. Besides this therear<> ruins of an ancient temple of Aesculapius, which,like the Nieephorion, was outside the city ( lac.Ann. iii. 63; Paus. v. 13. § 2); of a royal palace,which was surrounded by a wall, and connected withthe Ca'icus by an aqueduct; of a prytaneum, atheatre, a gymnasium, a stadium, an amphitheatre,and other public buildings. All these remainsattest the unusual splendour of the ancient city, andall travellers speak with admiration of their stu-pendous greatness. The numerous coins which wepoxao.ss "f Pergamum attest that Olympia werecelebrated there; a vase found there represents atorch-raco on horseback; and Pliny (x. 25) relatesthat public cock-tights took place there every year.Pergamum was celebrated for its manufacture ofointments (Allien, xv. p. 089), pottery (Plin. xxxv.46), and parchment, w hich derives its name (chai taPergamena) from the city.

The wholeline is thus given in the Autonine Itinerary (up. 112,11G):— From Beneventum to Kquus Tuticus (S. Eleuterio) - xxi. M. P Aei ae ( Troja) - xviiu* Herdoiiia (Or dona) - - - - • xviii. Canusium (Canosa)» - - - - xxvi. Rubi (A'l/ro) ------ - xxiiL Butuntum {BUonto) - - - - xi. Turres (?) - - - - - - - xxi. Egnatia {Torrt di Gnazia) - - xvi. Brundusium (Brindisi) - - - - xviii. The two stations of Turns between Barium andEgnatia, and Speluncae between Egnatia and Brun­dusium, cannot be identified; it is evident from thenames themselves that they were not towns, butmerely small places on the coast so called. TheJerusalem Itinerary has two stations, Turres Aure-lianae, and Tunes Juliae, between Egnatia andBarium, but, from tlie distances given, neither ofthese can be identified with the Turres of the Anto-nine Itinerary. The other intermediate stationsmentioned by the same authority are unimportant Mu-tationes, which can be identified only by a carefulsurvey on the spot. The Tabula gives (though in a very confusedmanner) an intermediate line of route, which appearsto have been the same as that indicated by Strabo(v. p. 283), which quitted the coast at Egnatia,and proceeded through Caelia to Brundusium. Thestations given are:— Canusium to Rudiae - - - xii. m.p. Rubi . - - . xiv. Butuntnm - - ix. Caelia (Cegtie) - ix. Khetium(Azetium?) — Konre (?) - - - ix. Ad Veneris (?) - viii. Egnatia - - - viii.It is certain that the Via Trajana was continued,probably by Trajan himself, from Brundusium toHydruntum (Otranto), and was thence carriedall round the Calabrian peninsula to Tarentum.The road from Brundusium to Hydruntum pissedthrough Lupiae (Lecct), in the interior of the penin­sula, which is correctly placed 25 miles from each ofthe above cities, (/(in. Ant. p. 118.) The stationson the other line, which is given only in the Tabula,are as follow:— M. P. Hydruntum to Castrum Minervae (Castro) viii. Veretum (Sta Maria di Vere to) ----- xii.Uxentum (Ugento) - ~ x.Baletium (Aletium) - - x.N ere turn (Xardo) - - x.Manduria (Matiduria) - xxix.Tarentum (TararUo) - xx. The above distances appear to be correct. Lastly, a brunch struck off from the Via Trajanaat Barium which proceeded direct to Tarentum.

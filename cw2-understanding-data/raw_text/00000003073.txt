ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 45 sessed themselves of this country, but eight hundred years afterJoshua had been their leader, and, as I have already observed,two hundred and forty years, seven months, and seven days, af­ter they had revolted from Rehoboam, the grandson of David,and had given the kingdom to Jeroboam, And such a conclu­sion overtook the Israelites, when they had transgressed the laws,»nd would not hearken to the prophets, who foretold thatthis calamity would come upon them, if they would not leaveoff their evil doings. What gave birth to these evil doings,was that sedition which they raised against Rehoboam the grand­son of David, when they set up Jeroboam his servant to be theirking, who, by sinning against God, and bringing them to imitatehis bad example, made God to be their enemy, while Jeroboamunderwent that punishment which he justly deserved. 2. And now the king of Assyria invaded all Syria and Pheni-cia in a hostile manner. The name of this king is also set downin the archives of Tyre, for he made an expedition against Tyre,in the reign of Eluleus; and Menander attests to it, who, whenhe wrote his Chronology, and translated the archives of Tyre in­to the Greek language, gives us the following history: "One"whose name was Eluleus, reigned thirty-six "years: this king"upon the revolt of the Citteans, sailed to them, and reduc-"ed them again to a submission.

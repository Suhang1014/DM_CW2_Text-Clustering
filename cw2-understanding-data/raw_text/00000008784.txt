OCR Output l.-.l LELEGES.I.EGIO VII. GEMIXA. Roman city of Astoria, in Hispania TarraeoncnsKadmirably situated at the confluence of two tribu­taries of tlie Esla, at the foot of the Asturian moun­tains, commanding and protecting the plain of I^-on.As its name implies, it grew out of the station ofthe new 7th legion, which was raised by the emperorGalba in Hispania. (Dion Cass. iv. 24; Tae. Iligt.ii. 11, iii. 25; Suet. Calba, 10.) Taritua calls thelegion G.M.niANA, to distinguish it from the oldLkcio VII. Claudia, but this appellation is notfound on any genuine inscriptions. It appears tohave received the appellation of Gemina (respectingthe use of which, and Gf.mf.i.i.a, sec Caesar Ii. C.iii. 3) on account of its amalgamation by Vespasianwith one of the German legions, not improbably theLeoio I. Gekmanica. Its full name was VII.Gemina Felix. After serving in Pannonia, andin the civil wars, it was settled by Vespasian inHisjAiiia Tarraconensis, to supply the place of theVI. Victrix and X. Gemina, two of the three legionsordinarily stationed in the province, but which hadiMfii withdrawn to Germany. (Tac. Hist. ii. 11, 67,86. iii. 7, 10, 21—25, iv. 39; Inter, ap. Gruter,p. 215, no. 2.) That its regular winter quarters,under later emperors, were at lAon, we learn fromthe Itinerary, Ptolemy, and the Notitia Imperii,as well as from a few inscriptions (Muratori, p. 2037,no. 8, A.D. 130; p. 335, nos. 2, 3, A. D. 163;p. 336, no. 3. A. I>. 167; Gruter, p. 260, no. 1,A. f». 216); but there are numerous inscriptions toprove that a strong detachment of it was stationedat Tarraco, the chief city of the province, (Thefollowing are a selection, in order of time :— Orelli,no. 3496, A.D. 182; no. 4815; Grater, p. 365,no. 7.) In the inscriptions the legion has the sur­names of P. F. AXTONINIANA, V. V. AlEXAN- ]>i:i.\na, and P. F. Skvekiasa Alexandhiana;and its name occurs in a Greek inscription as AET.Z. AIAiVt (C. I. vol iii. no. 4022), while anothermentions a x^aPXov i" 'IoTraWa \tytuvus i€o6fxiji.(C. /. vol. i. no. 1126.) There is an inscription inwhich is found a ''Tribunus Militum Leo. VII. Ge-minae Felicis ik Germania," from a comparisonof which with two inscriptions found in Germany(Lrline, Schriflen, vol. i. nos. 11, G2; Borghesi,guile iter. Horn. iU-1 Reno, p. 26), it has been in­ferred that the legion was employed on an expe­dition into Germany under Alexander Severn*, andthat this circumstance gave rise to the erroneousdesignation of XVp/zavurr) in the text of Ptolemy.((Kicking, N. D. jit. ii. pp. 102G, seq.: Marquardt'sIlrrkrr, Horn. Alterthum, vol. iii. pt. 2, p. 354;Grotefend, in Panly's Eeaimcyliopadie, t. v.Legio.) The station of this legion in Asturia grew intoan important city, which relisted the attacks of theGoths till A. n. 586, when it was taken by Leovi-gildo; and it was one of the few cities which theGoths allowed to retain their fortifications. Duringthe struggle with the Arab invaders, the same for­tress, which the Homans had built to protect theplain from the incursions of the mountaineers, be­came the advanced post which covered the mountain,as the last refuge of Spanish independence. Afteryielding to the first assault of the Moors, it wassoon recovered, and was restored by Ordono I. in850. It was again taken by Al-Mansur in 996,after a year's siege; but was recovered after Al-Mansurs defeat at Calatantaor, about A. D. 1000;repeopjed by Alonao V., and enlarged by Alonso XI.,urjder whose successor, Don Pedro, it ceased to be the capital of the kingdom of Leon, by the removalof the court to Strille.

The plain was abacelebrated for its vineyards ; and in it there weremines of copper and iron. (Strab. i. p. 58, x. p. 44 7,seq. ; Horn.

LE'LEGES (A^Aeyet). an ancient race whichwas spread over Greece, the adjoining islands, andthe Asiatic coast, before the Hellenes. They wereso widely diffused that we most either suppose thattheir name was descriptive, and applied to severaldifferent tribes, or that it was the name of a uncletribe and was Hfterwanis extended to others. Straho(vii. p. 322) regarded them as a mixed race, and «aidisposed to believe that their name had reference tothis (to o-uAA«'ktoi>s ytyoifinuy. They niay pro­bably bo looked upon, like the Pehu^iana and theother early inhabitants of Greece, as members ofthe great Indo-Europoan race, who became gra­dually incorporated with the Hellenes, and thatceased to exist as an independent people. The most distinct statement of ancient writers twthe origin of the Leleges is that of HerorWus, whosays that the name of Iv leges was the ancient nan*of the Carions (Herod, i. 171). A later Gmki writer considered the Lclcirca as stambug in thesame relation to the Carions as the lleko to theLacedaemonians and the Penestae to the Tbesamhana.| (Allien, vi. p. 271.) In Homer both Lelrgea andCarians appear as equals, and as auxiliaries of theTrojan*. (IL x. 428.) The Leleges are ruled byAltcs, the father-in-law of Priam, and inhabit a

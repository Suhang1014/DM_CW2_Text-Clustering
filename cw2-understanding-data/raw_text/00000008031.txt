(For detailsand authorities see the Diet of Biogr. under therespective names above mentioned.) In B.C. 191 Pherae surrendered to Antiochus,king of Syria, but it shortly afterwards fell into thehands of the Roman consul Acilius. (Liv. xxxvi.9, 14.) Situated at the end of the Pelasgian plain,Pherae possessed a fertile territory. The city wassurrounded with plantations, gardens, and walledenclosures. (Polyb. xviii. 3.) Stephanos B. («. v.)speaks of an old and new Pherae distant 8 stadiafrom each other. In the middle of Pherae was a celebrated fountaincalled Hypereia ('TWpeia, Strab. ix. p. 439;Pind. Pgtk. iv. 221: Sophoel. ap. Schol. ad rind.L e.; Plin. iv. 8. s. 15.) The fountain Messeis wasalso probably in Pherae. (Strab. fat, p. 432; Horn.IL vi. 457; Val. Flacc ir. 374: Plin. /. e.) The remains of Pherae are situated at Vtlettlno,where the ancient walls may be traced on every sideoxcept towards the plain. On the northern side aretwo tabular summits, below the easternmost ofwhich on the southern side is the fountain Hy­pereia, which rushes from several openings in therock, and immediately forms a stream.

Thocity was said to have derived its more ancient namefrom Phigalns, a son of Lycaon, its original founder,and its later name from Phialus, a son of Lycaon,its second founder. (Pans. f. c; Steph. B.) In B.C.659 the inhabitants of Phigalia were obliged to sur­render their city to the l.aceilaemonians, but theyrecovered possession of it again by the help of achosen body of Oresthasians, who, according to an<)racle, perished fighting against the Lacedaemonians.

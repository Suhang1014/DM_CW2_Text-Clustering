The copies of Papinian or Ulpian,which the reformer had proscribed, were deemedunworthy of future notice; the twelve tables andpraetorian edict insensibly vanished, and the monu­ments of ancient Rome were neglected or destroyedby the envy and ignorance of the Greeks. Even thePandects themselves have escaped with difficulty anddanger from the common shipwreck, and criticismhas pronounced, that all the editions and manuscriptsof the West are derived from one original*. It wastranscribed at Constantinople in the beginning of theseventh century t, was successively transported by theaccidents of war and commerce to Amalphi t, Pisa§,and Florence ||, and is now deposited as a sacred relic ^[in the ancient palace of the republic**. * All, in several instances, repeat the errors of the scribe and the transposi­tions of some leaves in the Florentine Pandects. This fact, if it be true, is de.cisive. Yet the Pandects are quoted by Ivo of Chartres (who died in 1117), byTheobald, archbishop of Canterbury, and by Vacarius, our first professor, in theyear 1140 (Selden ad Fletam, c. 7. tom, ii p. 1080—1085). Have our BritishMSS. of the Pandects been collated? •y See the description of this original in Brenckman (Hist. Pandect. Florent.1. i. c. 2, 3. p. 4—17. and 1. ii.). Politian, an enthusiast, revered it as the au­thentic standard of Justinian himself (p. 407, 408); but this paradox is refutedby the abbreviations of the Florentine MS. (1- ii. c . 3. p. 117—130). It is com­posed of two quarto volumes with large margins, on a thin parchment, and theLatin characters betray the hand of a Greek scribe. $ Brenckman, at the end of his history, has inserted two dissertations on therepublic of Amalphi, and the Pisan war in the year 1135, &c. § The discovery of the Pandects at Amalphi (A. D. 1137) is first noticed (in1501) by Ludovicus Bologninus (Brenckman, 1. i. c. 11. p. 73, 74. 1 . iv. c. 2.p. 417—425), on the faith of a Pisan chronicle (p. 409, 410), without a nameor a date. The whole story, though unknown to the xiith century, embellishedby ignorant ages, and suspected by rigid criticism, is not, however, destitute of much internal probability (1. i. c. 4 8. p. 17—50). The Liber Pandectarum of Pisa was undoubtedly consulted in the xivth century by the great Bartolus(p. 406, 407. See 1 . i. c 9. p. 50—62). U Pisa was taken by the Florentines in the year 1406; and in 1411 thePandects were transported to the capital. These events are authentic and famous. 51 They were new bound in purple, deposited in a rich casket, and shown tocurious travellers by the monks and magistrates bareheaded, and with lightedtapers (Brenckman, 1. i. c. 10, 11, 12. p. 62—93). ** After the collations of Politian, Bologninus, and Antoninus Augustinus, andthe splendid edition of the Pandects by Taurellus (in 1551), Henry Brenckman,a Dutchman, undertook a pilgrimage to Florence, where he employed severalyears in the study of a single manuscript. His Historia Pandectarum Florcn-tinorum (Utrecht, 1722, in 4to), though a monument of industry, is a small por­tion of his original design.

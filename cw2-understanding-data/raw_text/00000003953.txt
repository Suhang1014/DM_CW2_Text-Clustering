Christ; nay, while his testimonies of John the Baptist andof James the Just are so honorable, and give them so greatcharacters, it is also impossible that his testimony concerningChrist should be other than very honorable, or such as affordedhim a still greater character also. Could the very same author,who gave such a full and advantageous character of John theBaptist, the forerunner of Jesus of Nazareth, all whose disci­ples were by him directed to Jesus of Nazareth, as to the trueMessias, and all of whom became afterwards the disciples ofJesus of Nazareth, say nothing honorable of that Jesus of Na­zareth himself; and this in a history of those very times inwhich he was born and lived, and died, and that while thewriter lived but a little after him in the same country in whichhe was born, and lived, and died ? This is almost incredible.And further, could the very same author, who gave such anadvantageous character of James the Just, and this under thevery appellation of James the brother of Jesus, who was calledChrist, which James was one of the principal disciples orapostles of this Jesus Christ, and had been many years theonly Christian bishop of the believing Jews of Judea and Je­rusalem, in the very days, and in the very country of thiswriter; could he, I say, wholly omit any, nay, a very honor­able account of Jesus Christ himself, whose disciple and bishopthis James most certainly was ? This is also almost incredible.Hear what Ittigius, one of the wisest and learnedest of all thosewho have lately inclined to give up the testimony concerningChrist, as it stands in our copies, for spurious, says upon thisoccasion:—"If any one object to me, that Josephus hathnot omitted John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, norJames the disciple of Christ, and that therefore he could nothave done the part of a good historian, if he had been entirelysilent concerning Christ, I shall freely grant that Josephuswas not entirely silent concerning Christ; nay, I shall furthergrant, that when Josephus was speaking of Christ, he did notabstain from his commendation; for we are not to determinefrom that inveterate hatred which the modern Jews bear toChrist, what was the behavior of those Jews, upon whom themiracles that were daily wrought by the apostles in the nameof Christ imprinted a sacred horror."

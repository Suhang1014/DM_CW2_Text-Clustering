I know, too,that at present the Thebans choose as the annual priest ofApollo Ismenios, a boy illustrious for his origin, and ofgreat beauty and strength. This boy is called Daphnophoros,because ht is crowned -with laurel. But I am not certainwhether all the boys that are crowned with laurel dedi­cate a brazen tripod to Apollo. It appears to me, thatall are not obliged to do this by law; for I did not feemany tripods dedicated here. The wealthier fort of theseboys however dedicate tripods: and among these, thatwhich Amphitryon dedicated,withHercules on it crownedwith laurel, is the most illustrious, both for its antiquityand the renowH of the person by whom it was sent as anoffering. Beyond this temple of Ismenian Apollo you willsee a fountain, which they say is sacred to Mars: andthey add, that a dragon is stationed here by Mars asthe guardian of the fountain. Near this is the tomb ofCaanthus, who they fay was the brother of Melia, andthe son of Ocean ; and who was sent by his father to seekhis sister that was forcibly taken away. But when hesound that (he was in the power of Apollo, and that in con­sequence of this he was not able to take her away, he hadthe boldness to set on fire the grove- of Apollo, whichthey call Ismenion; and for this action, as the Thebansfay, the god flew him with his arrows. They fay, too, thatApollo had two sons by Melia, Tenerus and Ismenius;and that Apollo endowed Tenerus with a prophetic power,but the river was denominated from Ismenius. However,prior to the birth of Ismenius this river was calledLadoa. CHAF.

The Teneataeclaimed descent from the inhabitants of Tenedos,who were brought over from Troy as prisoners, andsettled by Agamemnon in this part of the Corinthia; iand they said tiiat it was in consequence of llieirTrojan origin that they worshipped Apollo above allthe other pods. (Pans. ii. 5. § 4.) Strabo also imentions here the temple of Apollo Tcneat.es, and jsays that, Tenea and Tenedos had a common originin Tennus, the son of Cyeims. (Strab. viii. p. 330.)According to Dionysius, however, Tenea was of lutefoundation, (Cic. ad Ate. vi. 2. § 3.) It was at |Tenen that Oedipus was said to have passed hischildhood. It was also from this place that Archiastm.k the greater number of tlie colonists with whomhe founded Syracuse. After the destruction ofCorinth by Mummius, Tenea had the good fortune11> coul inue undisturbed, because it is said to have as­sisted the Romans against Corinth. (Strab. I. c.) Wecannot, however, suppose that an insignificant placelike Tenea could have acted in opposition to Corinthand the Achaean League; and it is more probable 1thai the Teneatae were spared by Mummius in conse­quence of their pretended Trojan descent and conse­quent affinity with the Romans themselves. Howeverthis may be, their good fortune gave rise to the line: to5ai',uan' 6 KopiyBos, tyw 8' ttrff Tei'td.7T}S, Tenea lay in Hie mountain valley through whichflows the river that falls into the Corinthian gulf tothe east of Corinth. In this valley are three placesat which vases and other antiquities have been dis­covered, namely, at the two villages of Chilimodiand Klenta, both on the road to Xauplia, and thelatler at the very foot of the ancient road ContO]X)ria[see Vol. I. p. 201, b.], and at the village of Athiki.an lumr east of ChUimodi, on the read to Sophiko.In the holds of Athiki there was found an ancientstatue of Apollo, a striking confirmation of the pre­valence of the worship of this god in the district. TheTeneatae would therefore appear to have dwelt inscattered abodes at these three spots and in the in­tervening country; hut the village of Tenea, properlyso called, was probably at Chilimodi, since the dis­tance from this place to Corinth corresj»onds to the60 stadia of I'ansanias. Since one of the passes from the Argeia into theCorinthia runs by KUnia and Chilimodi, there canlie little doubt that it was by this road that Agesi-laus marched from the Argeia toCorinth in B.C. 391.(Xen. Hell. iv. o. § 19.) In the text of Xenophonthe words are eVe^te vw*p€a\u>v Kara Teyeav isKtipivBov, but TWai/ ought to be substituted forTeyf'ar. since it is impossible to believe that Age-silans could have marched from the Argeia toCorinth by way of'Tegea. Moreover, we learn fromStrabo (viii. p. 380) that the well-known name ofTegea was in other cases substituted for that ofTenea. In the parallel passage of the AgetiLxvx ofXenophon (ii. 17), the pass by Tenea is calledh-uTa tit fl-T€t'a.

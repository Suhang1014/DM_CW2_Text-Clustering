Its regularconical form and isolated position, a3 well as thecrater-like basin near its summit, at once mark itas of volcanic origin; and this is confirmed by thenature of the rocks of which it is composed. Henceit cannot be considered as properly belonging to therange of the Apennines, from which it is separatedby a tract of hilly country, forming as it were thebase from which the detached cone of Monte Voltorerises. No ancient author alludes to the volcaniccharacter of Mount Vultur; but the mountain itselfis noticed, in a well known passage, by Horace, whomust have been very familiar with its aspect, as itis a prominent object in the view from his nativecity of Venusia. (Carm. iii. 4. 9—16.) He thereterms it "Vultur Apulus," though he adds, singu­larly enough, that he was without the limits ofApulia ('* altricis extra limen Apuliae") when hewas wandering in its woods. This can only be ex­plained by the circumstance that the mountain stood(as above stated) on the confines of three provinces.Lucan also incidentally notices Mt. Vultur as one ofthe mountains that directly fronted the plains ofApulia. (Lucan, ix. 185.) The physical and geological characters of MountVultur are noticed by Romanelli (vol. iLp. 233), andmore fully by Daubeny (Description of Volcanoes,chap. 11). [E. H. 13.] VULTURNU11 (QvuvXTovpvQv. Castel Voltumo),a town of Campania, situated on the sea-coast at themouth of the river of the same name, and on its S.bank. There is no trace of the existence of anytown on the site previous to the Second Punic War,when the Romans constructed a fortress (castellum)at the mouth of the river with the object of securingtheir possession of it, and of establishing a magazineof corn for the use of the army that was besdegingCapua. (Liv. xxv. 20, 22.) It is probable thatthis continued to exist and gradually grew into atown: but in it. c. 194, a colony of Roman citizenswas established there, at the same time with Inter­num and Puteoli. (Id. xxxiv. 45; Varr. L. L. v. 5.)The number of colonists was in each case but small,and Vultumum does not appear to have ever riseninto a place of much importance. But it is noticedby Livy as existing as a town in bis time (" ad Vul-turni ostium, ubi nunc urbs est," xxv. 20), and ismentioned by all the geographers. (Strab. v. p.238; Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Mel. ii. 4. § 9; Ptol. iii. 1.§ 6.) We learn also that it received a fresh colonyunder Augustus (Lib. Colon, p. 239), and retainedits colonial rank down to a late period. It becamean episcopal see before the close of the Roman Em­pire, and appears to have continued to subsist downto the 9th century, when it was destroyed by theSaracens. In the 17th century a new fortress wasbuilt nearly on the ancient site, which is calledCastel Voltumo or CastelC a Mare di Volturno.But from the remains of the ancient city still visibleit appears that this occupied a site somewhat nearerthe sea than the modern fortress. Several inscrip­tions have been found on the spot, which attestthe colonial rank of Vultumum as late as the ageof the Antonines. (Mummscn, /. R. N. 3535—3539.) [E. H.

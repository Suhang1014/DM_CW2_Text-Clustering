YIvAtfvtos),an ancienttown of Aetolia, between the Achelous and the Kvenus,mentioned in the Homeric catalogue of the Grecianships, is placed by Pliny on the Corinthian gulf. Itwould therefore seem to have existed in later times;although Strabo says that the Aeolians, having re­moved Pylene higher up, changed its name intoProschium. The site of Pylene is uncertain.

T\v\ios), the name of thivetowns ou the western coast of Peloponnesus. 1. A town in hollow Elis, described by Pausaniasas situated upon the mountain road leading fromElis to Olympia, and at the place where the Ladonflows into the Peneius (vi. 22. § 5). Strabo, in acorrupt passage, assigns to it the same situation,and places it in the neighbourhood of Scollium orMt. Scollis (fxfTa^u rov Hijveiou teal rov SeAA^tc-tos €kSo\T]S [read koI tjjs rov 2eKArjevros t/j.-SoAtjs] TlvKos tpicttTO, Strab. viii. p. 338). Pausa-nias (I.e.) says that it was 80 stadia from Elis.I>iodorus (xiv. 17) gives 70 stadia as the distance,and Pliny (iv. 5. s. 6) 12 Roman miles. Accordingto the previous description, Pylus should probably beidentified with the ruins at Agrdptdho-khdri,situatedon a commanding position in the angle formed by thejunction of the Peneius and Ladon. This site isdistant 7 geographical miles from Elis. which suffi­ciently agrees with the 80 stadia of Pausanias.Leake, however, places Pylus further at the ruinsat Kufatjli, mainly on the ground that they are not sofar removed from the mad between Elis and Olympia.Rut the fact of the ruins at Ayrdpidho-kh'tri beingat the junction of the Peneius and Ladon seems de­cisive in favour of that position ; and we may sup­pose that a road ran up the valley of the Peneius tothe junction of the two rivers, and then took a bendto the right into the valley of the Ladon. (Leake,Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 228, PeJoponnesiaca,p. 219; Bobiaye, Recherchts, (fc. p. 122; Curtius,Peloponnesus, vol. ii. p. 39.) The Eleian Pylus issaiil to have been built by the Pylon, son of Clesonof Megara, who founded the Messenian Pylus, andwho, upon being expelled from the latter place byPeleus, settled at the Eleian Pylos. (Pans. iv. 36.§ l,vi.22.§ ,">.) Pylus was said to have been destroyedby Hercules, and to have been afterwards restoredby the Eleians; but the story of its destruction byHercules more properly belongs to the MessenianPylus. Its inhabitants asserted that it was the townwhich Homer had in view when he asserted that theAlpheius flowed through their territory ('AA<£»« *ou,'6-rr' fiipb f>4ct IluAiW 5ia yairjs, II. v. 545). Onthe position of the Homeric Pylus we shall speakpresently; and we only observe here, that this claimwas admitted by Pausanias (vi. 22.5} 6), though itsabMirdity had been previously pointed out by Strabo(viii. n. 350, seq.). Like the other Eleian towns,Pylus is raiely mentioned in history. In P. C. +02it was taken by the Spartans, in their invasion of theterritory of Elis (Diod. xiv. 17); and in d. r. 366 it is mentioned as the place where the derr-vniriexiles from Elis planted themselves in order to ran"on war against the latter city. (Xen. BeH rx i§ 1 6.) Pausam'as saw only the rains of iMm (*22. § 5), and it would appear to have \xtn dessr.tlong previously. 2.

A town of Palestine in the district of Peraea,east of Jordan, near the river Jabbok, was thelater name of Rabbath-Ammon, sometimes calledKabbah only, the ancient capital of the Ammo­nites. (Deut. iii. 11 ; Josh, xiii. 25.) It wasbesieged by Juab and taken by David. (2 Sam.xi. 1, xii. 26—31; 1 Chron. xx. 1.) It recovereditd independence at a later period, and we find theprophets denouncing its destruction. (Jer. xlix. 3;Ezek. xxv, 5.) Subsequently, when this part ofPalestine was subject to Aegypt, the city was re­stored by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who gave it thename of Philadelphia. (Steph. B. $. v.; I.. -• b.Onom. $ v. 'Pdpa$, 'A/i/iaV.) Stephanus says thatit was originally called Ammana, afterwards Astarte,and lastly Philadelpheia. It is frequently mentionedunder its new name by Josephus (/?. J. i. 6. § 3,L 19. § 5, ii. 18. § 1), and also by Ptolemv (t. 17.§ 23), Pliny (v. 18. s. 16), Hierocles (p. 722), andupon coins. (Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 351.) The oldname, however, did not go out of use, for Poly-bius speaks of the city tinder the name of Kabbata-mana ('PaGGardfiava, v. 71); and the ruins arenow called Amman, a name which they also bore inthe time of Abulfeda. {Tab.

Philae proper, although the smaller, is,from its numerous and picturesque ruins, the moreinteresting of the two. It is not more than 1250English feet, or rather less than a quarter of a mile,long, and about 400 feet broad. It is composed ofSyenite stone: its sides are steep and perhapsescarjicd by the hand of man, and on their summit*was built a lofty wall encompassing the island. ForPhilae, being accounted one of the burying-places ofOsiris, was held in high reverence both by theAegyptians to the N. and the Aethiopians to thaS.: and it was deemed profane for any tut prieststo dwell therein, and was accordingly sequesteredand denominated "the unapproachable" (&6aTurB QQ 3

B.), a city of Elis in thePisatis, situated upon the isthmus connecting thepromontory Ichthys (C of KaMkolo) with themainland. Strabo erroneously speaks of two pro­montories upon this part of the coast; one calledPheia, from the name of the neighbouring town, andanother more to the south, of which he has notgiven the name. (Strab. viii. 343.) Pheia is men­tioned by Homer, who places it near the Iardanus,which is apparently the mountain torrent north ofIchthys, and which flows into the sea on tlie northernside of the lofty mountain Skaq>hidi. (Horn. /. c.)Upon a very conspicuous peaked height upon thoisthmus of Ichthys are the ruins of a castle of themiddle ages, called Pontikekattro, built upon theremains of the Hellenic walls of Pheia. On eitherside of Ichthys are two harbours; the northern one,which is a small creek, was the port of Pheia; thosouthern one is the broad bay of Katakolo, which isnow much frequented, but was too open and exposedfbr ancient navigation. The position of these har­bours explains the narrative of Thncydides, whorelates that in the first year of the PeloponnesinnWar (n. c. 431), the Athenian fleet, having sailedfrom Methone in Messenia, landed at Pheia (tliat is,in the bay of KatAkoki), and laid waste the country;but a storm having arisen, they sailed round thepromontory Ichthys into the harbour of Pheia. Infront of the harbour was a small island, which Poly-bius calls Pheias (Strab. /. c.; Polyb. iv. 9). About amile north of the small creek at Pontikokattro, thereia a harbour called Khortiu, which Leake is disposedto identify with the port mentioned by Thurvdides,on the ground that the historian describes it 4' not asthe port of Pheia, but as a harbour in tlie districtPheia" (ihv iv rp 4>8eici Ki/iiya); but we think itmore probable that the historian intended the civekat the foot of PonHkokastro. In any case Pheiastood on the isthmus of Ichthys, and neither atKhar tut nor at the mouth of the torrent of Hkejiiiili,at one or other of which spt>ts Pheia is placed byBoblaye, though at neither are there any ancient re­mains.

Themonth of the river formed the port of the city, at adistance of 3 miles from it (Sigensis Portus, Itin.Ant. p. 13), opposite to the island of Acra, on thehighroad, and near Cirta, the residence of Syphax.(Strab. xvii. p. 829; Plin. v. 2. s. 1.) In Strabo'ltime it was in ruins, but must have been subse­quently restored, since it is mentioned in the Itine­rary (p. 12) as a Koman inunicipium. (Comp. Ptol./. c; Mela, i. 5; Scyiax, 51, 52.) According toShaw (Travels, p. 12), who, however, did not visitthe place, its ruins are still to be seen by the pre­sent Tucumbrit; others identify it with the Artich-kul of the Arabs, at the mouth of the Tafna, nearRasgm.

Near it the naval camp ofthe Greeks was said to have been formed during theTrojan War. (Herod, v. 65, 94; Thucyd. viii. 101;Strab. xiii. pp. 595, 603; Pomp. Mela, i. 18; Plin.v. 33; Ptol. v. 2. § 3; Serv. ad Am. ii. 312.) Thispromontory is now called YenUheri. Near the promontory was situated the town ofSigcum, which is said to have been an Aeoliancolony, founded under the guidance of Archueanaxof Mytilene, who used the stones of ancientTroy in building this new place. But some year*later the Athenians sent troops under Phrynon andexpelled the Mytileneans ; and this act of violenceled to a war between the two cities, which lusted fora long time, and was conducted with varying success.Pittacus, the wise Mytilenean, is said to have slainPhrynon in single combat. The poet Alcaeus al,M>was engaged in one of the actions. The dispu!ewas at length referred to Periander, of Corinth, whodecided in favour of the Athenians. (Strab. xiii.p. 599; Herod, v. 95; Steph.

(Strab.xiii. p. 600; Plin. v. 33.) A hill near Sigeum,forming a part of the promontory, was believed inantiquity to contain the remains of Achilles, whichwas looked npon with such veneration that graduallya small town seems to have risen around it, underthe name of Achillenm [ACHTtXHm].

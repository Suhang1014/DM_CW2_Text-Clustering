They reckoifcit necessarytoo to roll round the victims linen or flaxen bandages.And this is the Egyptian mode of adorning the victims.But they cause all the victims which are immolated to passin the procession; and it is the employment of some tosend them into the adytum, and of others who are beforethe adytum to burn the tents; after which they speedilydepart from this place. They fay too, that a certain person once among thenumber of those who are forbidden to enter the adytum,and who indeed was a profane man, when the pile wasenkindled, through curiosity and boldness entered the ady­tum; that all parts of it appeared to him to be full ofspectres; and that on his returning to Tithonca, as soonas he had related all that he had seen, he died. I haveheard things similar to these of a certain Phœnician.They say that the Egyptians celebrate the festival of Isisin that part of the year in which she bewails Osiris;that then the Nile begins to ascend; and that the vulgarof the natives fay, that the tears of Isis cause the Nile toincrease and irrigate the fields. At that time, therefore,a certain Roman, who was the prefect of Egypt, per­suaded a man, for a sum os money, to enter into theadytum of Isis in Coptos. This man returned indeed,but died as soon as he had told what he had seen.Homer, therefore, appears to speak truly when he says,that no man can clearly behold the gods, and at the fametime be prosperous in his affairs. But Tithoræa producesfewer olives than either the Attic or Sicyonian land.

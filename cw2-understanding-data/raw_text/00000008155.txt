Grace has, sent a colony to Scylacium,*&tdi sppeart to have assumed the name of Miner->imi or Colunia Minervia. (Veil. Pat. i. 15; Momm-in BerickU der Sdckruchen GueUschaft der,i umuoto/im, 1849, pp. 49—51.) The name is ■ n:tfn by Yelleius " Scclatium;" and the form "Sco-mvn" U fi>und also in an inscription of the reign oftiuiinsi Pins, from which it appears that the placer«: luft received a fresh colony under Nerva. (Orell.ver. 136; Monunsen, l.c). Scylacium appearsa Live become a considerable town after it receivedit l^nun colony, and continued snch throughoutU Roman Empire. (Mel. ii. 4. § 8; Plin. iii. 10. Ij, l*tol iii. 1. § 11.) Towards the close of thisr-vil it was distinguished as the birthplace ofW 'liiYus, who has left us a detailed but rhetoricalamotion of the beauty of its situation, and fertilityf itk territory. (Cassiod. Var, xii. 15.) The inouVrn city of SquUlace is a poor place, with-t ■boot 4000 inhabitant*, though retaining itsatojtal tee. It stands upon a hilt about 3 miles*n i.vfiea, a p« wit ion according with the descrip-u ;itfn by Ca»*iodonis of the ancient city, but it[fwuUe that this occupied a site nearer the sea,fc*r* considerable ruins are said still to exist,**t ii they hare not been described by any modern lie SCTLLKTICl-S Sinus (2*»«AAwTtifO» vo'Awos), Qwtf Sqwllacc, was always regarded as dan-mi* to mariners; hence Virgil calls it " nav if ra­ta SeyUajum." (Aen. iii. 553.) There is no inl port throughout its whule extent, and it*ir* an evil reputation for shipwrecks. Theaw » found iu Aristotle us well as Antiochus ofbut would seem to have been unknown toij'.vitdn; at least it is difficult to explain other­s' ti* peculiar manner in which he speaks of therKwuaa gulf, wLile relating the voyage of Gy-alofg the E. const of Bruttium.

[J.R.] CriXAEUM (to XkvMoiov: Scilla), a pro-ttarytand town or fortress, on the W. coast ofiinm, about 15 miles X. of Rhegium, andtit exactly at the entrance of the Sicilian strait. ■ ^naiajotory is well described by Strabo (vi. a* a projecting rocky headland, jutting out - ' into the aea, an«d united to the mainland by a-* nrck or isthmus, so as to form two small hut - '*i:ered bays, one on each tide. Thei-e can• <.>.ubt that this rocky promontory was the one:j brcarne the subject of bo many fables, and et was represented by Homer and other poets as the abode of the monster Scylla. (Horn. Od. xii.73, &c, 235, &c.; Biogr. Diet. art. Scylla.) Butthe dangers of the rock of Scylla were far morefabulous than those of its neighbour Charybdis, andit is difficult to understand how, even in the infancyof navigation, it could have offered any obstacle moreformidable than a hundred other headlands whosenames are unknown to fame. (Senec. Ep. 79;Smyth's Sicily, p. 107.) At a later period Anaxi-las, the despot of Rhegium, being struck with thenatural strength of the position, fortified the rock,and established a naval station there, for the pur­pose of checking the incursions of the Tyrrhenianpirates. (Strab. vi. p. 257.) In consequence of thisa small town grew up on the spot; and hence Plinyspeaks of an " oppidum Scyllaeum;" but it was pro­bably always a small place, and other writer* xpeakonly of the promontory. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Mel. ii. 4. § 8; Ptol. iii. 1. § 9.; Steph. By*, t. V.) Atthe present day the rock is still occupied by a fort,which is a post of considerable strength, while asmall town stretches down the slojjes towards thetwo bays. The distance from the castle to the op­posite point of the Sicilian coast, marked by theTorre del Faro, is stated by Capt. Smyth at 6047yards, or rather less than 3£ Eng. miles, but thestrait afterwards contracts considerably, so that itswidth between the Pwita del Pezto (Caenys Pnm.)and the nearest point of Sicily does not exceed 3971yards. (Smyth's Sicily, p. 108.) [E. H. B.] SCYLLAEUM (Sai/AAatoi'), a promontory ofTroezenia, and the most easterly point cf the Pelo­ponnesus, is said to have derived its name fromS-ylla, the daughter of Nisus, who, after betrayingMegara and Nisaea to Minos, was thrown by thelatter into the sea, and was washed ashore on thispromontory. Scyllaeum formed, along with theopposite promontory of Sunium in Attica, the en­trance to the Saronic gulf. It is now called Kavo~Skyli; but as Pausanias, in the paraphis from Scyl­laeum to Hermione, names Scyllaeum first, and thenBucephala, with three adjacent islands, it is neces­sary, as Leake has observed, to divide the extremitynow known as Kavo-Skyli into two parts; the boldround promontory to the N. being the true Scyl­laeum, and the acute cape a mile to the S. of itBucephala, since the three islands are adjacent tothe latter.

[Laconia, p. 114, b.] SCYROS or SCYRUS (2«Spo»: Eth. 2ici5piof:Skyro), an island hi the Aegaean sea, and one of thenorthern Sporades, was so called from its rugged-ness. It lay east of Euboea, and contained a townof the same name (Strab. ix. p. 436; Scylax, p. 23;Ptol. iii. 13. § 47), and a river called Cephissus.(Strab. ix. p. 424.) Scyros is frequently mentionedin the stories of the mythical period. Here Thetisconcealed her son Achilles in woman's attire amongthe daughters of Lycomedes, in order to save himfrom the fate which awaited him under the wallsI of Troy. (Apollod. iii. 13. § 8; Paus. i. 22. § 6;| Strab. ix. p. 436.) It was here also that Pyrrhus,the son ol Deidamia by Achilles, was brought up,and was fetched from thence by Ulysses to theTrojan War.

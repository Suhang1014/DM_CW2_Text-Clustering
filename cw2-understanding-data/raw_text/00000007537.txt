When Minucianus and Cherea had met together, and sa­luted one another ("as they had been used in former conversa­tions to give the upper hand to Minucianus, both on account ofhis eminent dignity, for he was the noblest of all the citizens,and highly commended by all men, especially when he madespeeches to them,) Minucianus began first, and asked Cherea,What was the watch-word he had received that day fromCaius ? for the affront, which was offered Cherea in giving thewatch-words, was famous over the city.

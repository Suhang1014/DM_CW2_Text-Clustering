Imp. mention is made of a military forceunder the name of Numerus Turnacensium; and ofa "P roc orator Gynaecii Tornacensis Belgicae Se-cundae." This procurator is explained to be a super­intendent of some number of women who wereemployed in making clothing for the soldiers. Hie-ronymus about a. i>. 407 speaks of Tumacnnias one of the chief towns of Gallia ; and Audocnus,iu his life of 8. Eligius (St. Eloi) in the seventhcentury, says of it, "quae quondam regalis extititcivitas." Tarnacum was within the limits of theancient territory of the Xervii. The Flemish nameis JJoornick; which the French hive corrupted intoTournai. Tournai is on the Scheldt-, in the pro­vince of Hainault, in the kingdom of Belgium. There are silver corns of Turnacum, with thelegend dvknacos and dvknacvs. On one sidethere is the head of an armed man, and on theother a horseman armed. On some there is said tobe the legend dvbno hex. Numerous Romanmedals have been found at Tournai, some of thetime of Augustus and others as late as Claudius Go-thicus and Tetricus, and even of a later date. Thetomb of Clulderic I., wdio died a. d. 481, was dis­covered at Tournai in the seventeenth century, anda vast quantity of gold and .silver medals, and othercurious things ; among which was the golden ringnf Childeric, with his name on it, CHILDIRICIkkois. Such discoveries as these, which have beenmade in various places in Belgium, show how littlewe know of the Roman history of this country.(I)'Anville, Notice, $c.; Ukert, Gidlicn \ IfccrjeilffA nti'/uitts Romaincs et Gauloises trouvees dans layinmlre pmprement dite, par M.

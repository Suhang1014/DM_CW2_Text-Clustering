The banks or rows of seats are atpresent 45 in number, but, from the repairs ami al­terations which the building has undergone, it isnot certain whether this was the original number.It is estimated that it would afford seats for about22,000 persons. There are also a few remains of a Roman theatre,on the left bank of the Adige, at the foot of the billimmediately under the castle of S. PUtro It ap­pears from two decrees of king Berengarius, dated in895 and 913, that the theatre was then regarded asof the highest antiquity, and had in great part goneto ruin ; on which account its destruction was al­lowed. (Descriz. di Verona, pt. w. p. 108, so/].) We have already alluded to tin' ancient gate calledthe Porta <Ie Borsurt. It is evidently older thanthe walls of Gallicnus, the elevation of winch in thespate of 8 mouths is recorded upon it; since a pre­vious inscription has been erased in order to makeroom for the new* one. It is a double gate, of avery florid style of architecture, concerning the me­rits of which architects have held widely differentopinions. The walls of Gallienua, to judge of themfrom the vestiges which still remain, were of a con­struction sufficiently solid, notwithstanding theshortness of the time in which they were erected.The other remains of antiquity at Verona, as thePorta de1 Leoni, the baths, &c, do not require anyparticular description in this place. The chief works on Verona and its antiquities arethe splendid ones of Count Scip. MafFei, entitledVerojut IUusti'afa, and Museum Veronense. Onu-phrius Panvinius also described its remains (Autiq.Veron. lib. viii. Pat lGtiS). Some account ofthem will likewise be found in the Deser&ione diVerona e delta sua Provincia, by Giovambatista daPertico. 8vo. Verona, 1820. [T. H, D.] VEKONES.

Pliny (iii. 4) says: "Itegio Cama-tullicorum, dein Suelteri, supraque Verrucini.*1[Camatuluci; SuBLTKlti.] There is nothing toguide us in fixing the position of the Verrucini, ex­cept their position with respect to these two othertribes, and the fact that there is a place namedVerignon, between Draguignan and Itiez. l)ra-guignnn is in the depaitinent of Var, and Riez is onthe site of Reii [Rkii ApolmnahesJ. [G.L.] VERRUGO or VERRUCA (*E#awM,Diod.: Collelurro?), a town or fortress in the territory of theVolsci, which is repeatedly mentioned during the warsof the Romans with that people. The name first occursin B.C. 445, when we are told that the place hadbeen recently occupied and fortified by the Romans,evidently as a post of offence against the Volscians;u proceeding which that people resented so much thatit became the occasion of a fresh war. (Liv. iv. I.)We do not know at what period it fell again into thehands of the Volscians, but in n. c. 409 it was re­covered and again garrisoned by the Romans. (/&.55, 56; Diod. xiv. 11.) It, however, fell once moreinto the hands of the Volscians in b. c. 407 (Liv.iv. 58), and apparently continued in their possessiontill B.C. 394, when it was again occupied with agarrison by the military tribune C. Aemilius, butlost soon after in consequence of the defeat ofhis colleague Sp. Post u mi us. (Liv. t. 28; Di<<d.xiv. 1)8.) From this time it wholly disappears fromhistory.

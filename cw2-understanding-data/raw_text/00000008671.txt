[Mabmarica.JLIBYPHOENI'CES (Aigutpo* races, sometimes•pelt Aifo^oiVtircf). a portion of the population ofN. Africa, who are defined by Livy, in accordancewith the signification of their name, as "mixtumPuuicum Afris gmiia" (Liv. xxi. 22). Diodoruagives a somewhat fuller account of them, as one ofthe four races who inhabited the Carthaginian terri­tory in N. Africa, namely, the Punic inhabitants ofCarthage, the LibyPhoenicians, the Libyans, andthe Numidians; and he says that the Libyphoe-nicians possessed many of the cities on the sea­shore, and had the tie of intermarriage with theCarthaginians (Died. xx. 55). Pliny restricts themto the S. part of the ancient territory of Carthage.(Plin. v. 4. s.3: Lihypkoenices vocantur qui By-tncium incohmt); and there can be no doubt, fromthe nature of the case, that the original seat of therace was in the country around Carthage. It isn<"t, however, equally clear whether the Libyphoc-nieians of the Carthaginian colonies along the coastof Africa are to be regarded as a race arising out ofthe intermarriage of the original Punic settlers withthe natives of the surrounding country, or as thedescendants of Libyphoenicians from the countryround Carthage, who had been sent out as colonists.The latter is the more probable, buth from indicationswhich we find in the ancient writers, and from thewell-known fact that, in all such cases, it is thehalf-breed which multiplies rapidly, eo as to makeit a matter of importance for the members of thepure and dominant caste to find a vent for the in­creasing numbers of the race below them. Thatsuch was the policy of Carthage with regard tothe Libyphoenicians, and moreover that they weremarked by the energy and success which usuallydistinguishes such half-bred races, we have someinteresting proofs. The defence of Agrigentutnagainst the Komans, during the Second Punic War,was signalised by the skill and energy of Mutines,a Lihyphiienician of Hipponium, whom Livy de­scribes as "vir impiger, et &tb Hannibale mnyutvoomnet belli arte* edoctus" (Liv. xxv. 40). Themention of his native place, Hipponium, on theItrnttian coast, a city which had been for some timein the hands of the Carthaginians, is a proof of thetendency to make use of the race in their foreignsettlements; while the advantage taken by Hannibalof his talents agrees with the fact that he employedLibyphoenician cavalry in his armies. (Polyb. iii.S3; Lir. xxi. 22.) Niebuhr has traced the pre­sence of Libyphoenician* in the Punic settlement*in Sardinia, and their further mixture with theSardinians, as attested by Cicero in an interestingfragment of his speech fur Scauru*. {Lecture* onAnc Geog. vol ii. p. 275.) Avienos mentions the"wild Linvphoeniciana" on the S. coast of Spain,E. of Calpe. (Or. Mar. 419.) Perhaps the half-bred race* of the Spanish colonies in America fumi.shthe closest analogy that can be found to the Liby-phoenician subject* of Carthage. [P. S.] L1BYSSA (AisVrcra or Ai*«r<ra.

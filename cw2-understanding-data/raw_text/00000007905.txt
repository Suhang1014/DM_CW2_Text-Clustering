The error probably arose froma confusion of the names Choerades and Cerasus;but in consequence of this error, the name of Cera­sus was in the middle ages transferred to Pharnaciu,which hence still bears the name of Kerasunt orKerasonde. (Comp. Hamilton, Researches, i. pp.250, 261, foil.; Cramer, Asia Minor, i. p. 281.)Phamacia is also mentioned by Stephanus Byz.(«. a), several times by Strabo (ii. p. 126, xi. p. 499,xii. pp. 547, 549, 560, xiv. p. 677), and by Ptolemy(v. 6. § 5).

Steph. B., Fr.151 ; Scyl. p. 8; Scymn. p. 427; Diodor. xv. 13;Strab. vii. p. 315), an island off the coast of 11-lyricum, which was colonised by Greek settlers fromParas, who, in the first instance, gave it the namoof their own island, which was afterwards changedto Pharos. In this settlement, which took placeB. c 385, they were assisted by the elder Dionysius.When the Romans declared war against the lllyriansB c. 229, Demetrius, a Greek of Pharos, betrayedhis mistress. Queen Teuta, for which he was re­warded with the greater part of her dominions.(Polyb. ii. 11.) The traitor, relying on his con­nection witii the court of Macedon, set the Romansat defiance; he soon brought the vengeance of therepublic upon himself and his native island, whichwas taken by L. Aemilius in B.C. 219. (Polyb. iii.16; Zonar. viii. 20.) Pliny (iii. 30) and Ptolemy(ii. 17. § 14) speak of the island and city underthe same name, 1'hakia (<tapia), and Poly bins(£ c.) says the latter was strongly fortified. Thecity, the ancient capital, stood at Sturi Grad orCitta Vecchia, to the N. of the island, where re­mains of walls have been found, and coins with thelegend +AKinN. After the tail of the RomanEmpire the island continued for a long time in thehands of the Narentinc pirates. Its Slavonic nameis Hvar, a corruption of Pharos; and in Italian it iscalled Jsesina or Liesina. For coins of Pharos seeEckhel, vol. ii. p. 160; Sestini, Monet. Vet. p. 42;Mionnet, vol. ii. p. 46.

[E.B.J.] PHAROS (4>4>t, Strab. xviL p. 791, seq.; Steph.B. s. v.: Eth. 4>djoioi), a long narrow strip of rucklying off the northern coast of Aegypt, having theNew Port of Alexandria E. and the Old Harbour SW.[Alexamdreia, Vol. I. p. 97.] Its name is saidto have been derived from a certain pilot of Menelaus,who, on bis return from the Trojan War, died therefrom a serpent's bite. Pharos is mentioned in theOdyssey (iv. 355). and is described as one day's sailfrom Aegypt. This account has caused considerableperplexity, since Pharos is actually rather less than amile from the seaboard of the Delta; and it is notprobable that the hind, in the course of centuries. h:uadvanced or the sea receded materially. It is per­fectly intelligible, however, if we suppose the authorof the Odyssey to mean by Aegyptus, not thecountry itself but its river, since the Phuros is evennow nearly a day's sail from the Canopic arm ofthe Nile. Any other theory is untenable; tor this por­tion of the coast of the Delta consists of rocky bars and

In the lime of Du Perac, there were stillsome vestiges of them on the Quirinal, on the siteof the present Palazzo Rospiglum; but they havenow entirely disappeared. At one time the colossalfigures on Mont': Cavallo stood near these baths,till Sixtus V. caused them to be placed before theQuirinal palace. Tradition connects them with theEqui Tiridatis Regis Amneniorum, mentioned inthe Notitia in the 7th Region; in which case theywould belong to the time of Xero. On the otherhand they claim to be the works of Phidias andPraxiteles; but there is no means of deciding thismatter. Besides tlie baths here enumerated, the Xotitta andCurhsum mention, in the 13th Region, but undermutilated forms, certain Thermae Suranae ktDkcianae, to which we have already alluded in the51 li Section. They do not, however, seem to havebeen of much importance, and their history is un­known. XVII. The Bridges. Rome possessed eight or nine bridges; but theaccounts of them arc .so very imperfect that thereare not above two or three the history of which canhe satisfactorily ascertained. The Tons Subli-cius, the oldest and one of the most frequently men­tioned of all the Roman bridges, is precisely thatwhose site is most doubtful. It was built of wood,as ius name imports, by Ancus Marcius, in order toconnect the Janiculum, which he had fortified, withtiie city. (Liv. i. 33; Dionys. iii. 4,").) It wasconsidered of such religious importance that it wasunder the special care of the pontifices (Varr. L. L.v. § 83), and was repaired from time to time, evendown to the reign of Antoninus Pius. (Capitol.Ant. P. 8.) Nay that it must have existed in thetime of Constantine is evident, not only from itsbeing mentioned in the Xotitta, but also from thefact of a bridge at Constantinople being named afterit, no doubt to perpetuate in that city the remem­brance of its sacred character. (Jhscr. Const. Peg.xiv.) Yet the greatest.diftcren.ee of opinion prevailswith regard to its situation; and as this questionalso involves another respecting the site of thePons Aemilics, we shall examine them both to­gether. We shall first consider the cdrrninsiiKTs task"which the Sublician bridge was built; uj& li*t in­quire into the passages in ancient anihoa repriseit.

An inference might perhaps be drawnfrom a passage in Seneca, compared with another inPlant us, in favour of the bridge being outside of thePorta Trigemina: "In Sublicium Pontem me trans­fer et inter e^entes me abige: non ideo tamen medespiciam, quod in illorum numero consideo, quiinanuin ad stipern porrigunt." (Sen.de V. Beat. 25.)As the Pons Sublicius is here shown to have beenthe haunt of beggars, so Plautus intimates that their I station was beyond the P.

A modern writer lias, with much erudition andingenuity, endeavoured to trace the progress otPhoenician colonisation from the threefold cycle ofancient myths respecting the wanderings of Bel orBaal—the Cronos of the Greeks, and patron cod ofBy bins anil Berytus; of Astarte or Io (Venus-Urania), who was especially worshipped at Sidon;and of Melcarth or the Tyrian Hercules. (Movers.Pltoen. vol. ii. pt. ii. eh. 2.) With these myths arecombined the legends of the rap of Europa, of thewanderings of Cadmus anil Marmonia, of Helen,Dido, &c. That some portion of historical truthmay lie at the bottom of these myths can hardly bedisputed; but a critical discussion of them wouldrequire more space than can be here devoted to thesubject, and we must therefore content ourselveswith giving a -short sketch of what seems to he themost probable march of Phoenician colonisation. Cvprus, which lay within sight of Phoenicia, wasprobably one of the first places colonised thrnce.Its name of Chittim, mentioned in Genesis (x.), ispreserved in that of Citium, its chief town. (Cic.Fin. iv. 20) Paphos and Palaopaphos, at theSW. extremity of the island, and Golgos, near theSE. [joint, were the chief seats of the worship ofVenus-Urania, the propagation of which markedthe progress of Phoenician colonisation. The originof the colony is likewise shown by the legend ofthe conquest of Cyprus by Belus, king of Sidon(—'■ turn Belus opinium Vastabat Cyprum, et victorditione tenebat," Virg. Aen. i. 6*21, et ib. Serv.), whowas (he reputed founder of Citium, Lapathus, andother Cyprian towns. (Alex. Ephes. in Slepkan. v.Aiiirij^os.) A great many Phoenician inscriptionshave been found in tins island. Hence the Phoe­nicians seem to have proceeded to the coast of AsiaMinor, the islands of the Greek Archipelago, and theco:nt of Greece itself". Phoenician myths and tra­ditions are interwoven with the earliest history ofGreece, and long precede the Trojan War. Suchare ttie legends of Agenor in Cilicia, of Europa inRhodes and Crete, of Cadmus in Tbasos, Boeotia,Euhoea and Thera. Rhodes seems to have beenearly visited by th*1 Phoenicians; and, if it did notactually become their colony, there are at leastnumerous truces that they were once predominant inthe island. It is mentioned in Genesis (x. 4) in con­nection with Citium and Taitessus. (Comp. Epiphan.adv. finer?*. 30. 25, and Movers, vol. ii. pt. ii. p.248. note 127.) Conon, a writer who flourished inthe Augustan period, mentions tiiat the Heliades,the ruling dynasty in Khodes, were expelled by thePhoenicians {Fab. 47. ap. Phot. p. 187), and■numerous other tradirions testify their occupation ofthe island. Traces of the Phoenicians may also befound in Crete, though they arc fainter there thanat Rhodes. It is the scene of the myth of Europa,the Sidonian Astarte; and the towns of Itanos, whichalso bore the name of Aradeu (Steph. B. s. v. *\t<xv6s;Hierocl. §11; Arts, xxvii. 12), I.ebena, and Phoe-nice, were reputed to have been founded by them.We Icam from Thucydides (i. 8) that, the greaterpart of the Cyclades were colonised by Phoenicians.There are traces of them in Cilicia. Eycia, andCaria. We have already alluded to their intimateconnection with the last-named country, and Thucy­dides, in the passage just cited, mixes the Cariansand Phoenicians together. Chios and Samos arealso connected with tin1 Phoenicians by ancientmyths; and at Tencdos, Melicertes, worshipped with the sacrifice of infants, is the Tyrian Meclarih.

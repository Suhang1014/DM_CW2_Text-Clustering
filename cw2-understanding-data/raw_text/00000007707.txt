And this was the state Tiberias was now in. But as forGischala, its affairs were thus : When John, the son of Livi,saw some of the citizens much elevated upon their revolt fromthe Romans, he laboured to restrain them, and entreated them,that they would keep their allegiance to them. But he couldnot gain his purpose, although he did his endeavours to the ut­most ; for the neighbouring people of Gadara, and Gabara, andSogana, with the Tyrians, got together a great army, and fellupon Gischala, and took Gischala by force, and set it on fire jand when they had entirely demolished it, they returned home.Upon which John was so enraged, that he armed all his men,and joined battle with the people forementioned, and rebuiltGischala after a manner better than before, and fortified it withwalls for its future security. 11.

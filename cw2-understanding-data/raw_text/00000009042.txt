Although it is obviously im­possible to fix the precise elevation to which theancients assigned this name, it may be generallydescribed as the chain of limestone mountains, withvolcanic rocks, and some granite, which, branchingfrom the Caucasus, skirts the E. side of Jmiretia,and afterwards, under the name of the PerengahTagh, runs nearly SW. along the deep valley ofAjirah in the district of Tchildir; from whence itturns towards the S., and again to the W. along thevalley of the Acavipsis, to the W. of which, bearingthe name of the Kop Tagh, it enters Lesser Asia.(Ritter, Erdkwde, vel. x. p. 816; Chesney, Exped.Euphrat. vol. i. p. 2S5.)

[G.L.] MOSELLA (Mosel, Moselle'), a river of Gallia,which joins the Rhine at Coblem [Confluentes].In the narrative of his war with the Usipetes andTenetheri Caesar (£. G. iv. 15) speaks of" drivingthem into the water "ad confluentem Mosae ctRheni." One of the latest and best editors of Caesar,who however is singularly ignorant of geography,supposes this confluence of the Mosa and the Rhcnusto be the junction of the Mosa and a part of theRhenus which is mentioned by Caesar in anotherplace (B. G. iv. 10; Mosa.) But this is impossible,as D'Anville had shown, who observes that theUsipetes [Menapii] had crossed the Rhine in thelower part of its course, and landed on the territoryof the Menapii. Having eaten them up, the invadersentered the country of the Eburones, which we knowto be between the Rhine and the Mosa, and higherup than the country of the Menapii. From theEburones the Germans advanced into the Condrusiin the latitude of Liege; and they were here beforeCaesar set out after them. (B. G. iv. 6.) Caesar'snarrative shows that the German invaders were notthinking of a retreat: their design was to penetratefurther into Gallia, where they had been invited bysome of the Gallic states, who hoped to throw offthe Roman yoke. After the defeat of the Germanson the river, Caesar built bis wooden bridge over theRhine, the position of which was certainly some­where between Coblem and Andernach. The, con­clusion is certain that this confluence of the Rhenusand the Mosa is the confluence of the Rhenus andthe Mosella at CobUnz; and we must explain Caesar s B LI J

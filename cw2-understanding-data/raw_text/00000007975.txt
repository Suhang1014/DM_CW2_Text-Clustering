The rivers which fallinto the Euxine are all small, anil few of them aredistinguished by name in tlie geographers, thoughdoubtless not so unhononred by the dwellers upontheir banks : among them Pliny (iv. 18) mentionsthe Pira and the Orosrines. The Hebrus drains atleast one-half", probably nearer two-thirds, of the en­tire surface of Thrace ; and on its banks, or on thoseof its tributaries, most of the level portions of thecountry are situated, as well as nearly all the inlandtowns. Its principal affluents are the Arda (in somemaps called the Harpessus), and the Suemus on the\V\, the Tonzus, Artiscus, and Agrianes on the E. The Thracian coast of the Aegean is extremelyirregular in its outline, being broken up by bayswhich enter far into the land, yet appear to be ofcomparatively little depth. Most of them, indeed,are at the mouths of rivers, and have probablybeen filled up by alluvial deposits. It was perhapsfor this reason that several of them were calledlairs, as it* they had been regarded as belonging tothe land rather than to the sea; e. g. Lake Cercinitis,already mentioned, winch seems, indeed, to have beenlittle more than a marsh, and in Kiepert's map itssite is so represented; Lake Bistonis,east of Abdera;and Stentoris Lac us, at the mouth of the Hebrus.The gulf of Melas, formed by the northern shore ofthe Chersonesus and the opposite coast of what mayhe called the mainland, is an exception to this de­scription of the Thracian bays. The coasts on thePropontis and the Euxine are comparatively un­broken, the only gulf of any extent being l'ortusllellodos, near Anchialus, which is known in mo­dern times, by the name of the bay of Bourghaa,as one of the best harbours in the Euxine, the Thra­cian shore of which was regarded by the ancients asextremely dangerous. [Salmypkssus,] The principal promontories were, Ismarnm, Ser-rheum, Sarpedonium, and Mastusium, on the southerncoast; Thyoias and Haemi Extrema, on the eastern. For an account of one of the most remarkable partsof Thraee, see Ciikksonesus, Vol. I. p. 608. Off the southern coast are situated the islands ofThasos, Samotbrace, and Imbros; the first is sepa­rated from the mainland by a channel about 5 mileswide; the other two are considerably more distantfrom the shore. The climate of Thrace is always spoken of by theancients as being extremely cold and rigorous; thusAthenaeus (viii. p. 351) describes the year atAenosas consisting of eight months of cold and four monthsof winter; but such statements are not to be takenliterally, since many of them are mere poeticalexaggerations, and are applied to Thrace as therepresentative of the north in general. The Haemuswas regarded as the abode of the north wind, and thecountries beyond it were believed to enjoy a beauti­fully mild climate. (See Niebuhr, Ethnog. and(Jwg. i. p. 16, Eng. trans.; Soph. Antig.985; Eurip.Jines. 440; Tbeophr. de Caus. v. 17; Virg. Georg. iii.350 seq.; Ov. Pont. iv. 10. 41, ib. 7. 8; TrisL iii.10; &c.). Even after making full allowance for theundoubted effect of vast forests, undrained marshes,and very partial cultivation, in lowering the averagetemperature of a country, it is difficult to believethat a land, the northern boundary of which (i. e. ofThrace Proper) is in the same parallel of latitude asTuscany und the Pyrenees, and the highest moun­tains of which are less than 9000 feet above the level of the sea, can have had s Terr sroThat the winter was often axtmnri; mo, am abe no doubt.

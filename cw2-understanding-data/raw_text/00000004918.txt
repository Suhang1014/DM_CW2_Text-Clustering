OCR Output NOTES ON THE FIRST CHAPTER. [37] Vegetius, I. ii. and the rest of his firstbook. [38] The Pyrrhic Dance is extremely well illus­trated by M. le Beau, in the Academie des Inscrip­tions, torn. xxxv. p. 262, &c. That learned aca­demician, in a series of memoirs, has collected allthe passages of the ancients that relate to the Ro­man legion. [30] Joseph, de Bell. Judaico, 1. Hi. c. 5. Weare indebted to this Jew for some very curious de­tails of Roman discipline. [40] Plin. Panegyr. c. 13. Life of Hadrian, inthe Augustan history. [41] See an admirable digression on the Ro­man discipline, in the sixth book of his history. [42] Vegetius de Re Militari, 1. ii. c. 4, Sec.considerable part of his very perplexed abridgment,was taken from the regulations of Trajan and Ha­drian; and the legion, as he describes it, cannotsuit any other age os the Roman empire. [43] Vegetius de Re Militari, 1. ii. c. t. In thepurer age of Cæsar and Cicero, the word miltswas almost confined to the infantry. Under thelower empire, and in the times of chivalry, it wasappropriated almost as exclusively to the men atarms, who fought on horseback. [44] In the time of Polybius and Dionylius ofHalicarnassus, (I. v. c. 4$.) the steel point of thepilum seems to have been much longer. In thetime of Vegetius, it was reduced to a foot, or evennine inches. I have chosen a medium. [4;] For the legionary arms. See Lipfius deMilitia Romana, 1. iii. c. 2—7. [46] See the beautiful comparison of Virgil,Georgic. ii. v. 279. [47] M. Guichardt, Memoires Militaircs, torn. i.c. 4. and Nouveaux Memoires, torn. i. p. 293—311, has treated the subject like a scholar and anofficer. [48] °ee Arrian's Tactics.

[50] Veget. de Re Militari, I. ii. c. 6. Hispositive testimony, which might be supported bycircumstantial evidence, ought surely to silencethose critics who refuse the Imperial legion itsproper body of cavalry.

The truefense of that very curious passage was first discoveredand illustrated by M. de Beaufort, RepubliqueRomaine, 1. ii. c. 2. [53] As in the instance of Horace and Agricola.This appears to have been a defect in the Romandiscipline; which Hadrian endeavoured to remeJy,by ascertaining the legal age of a tribune.

Those who fix aregular proportion of as many foot, and twice atmany horse, confound the auxiliaries of the em­perors, with the Italian allies of the republic. [58] Vegetius, ii. 2. Arrian, in his order ofmarch and battle against the Alani. [59] The subject of the ancient machines istreated with great knowledge and ingenuity by theChevalier Folard (Polybe, torn. ii. p. 233—290).He prefers them in many respects to our moderncannon and mortars. We may observe, that theuse of them in the field gradually became moreprevalent, in proportion as personal valour andmilitary skill declined with the Roman empire.When men were ro longer found, their place wassupplied by machines. See Vegetius, ii. 2;. Ar­rian. [60] Vegetius finishes his second book, snd thedescription of the legion, with the following em­phatic words, "Universe qua; in queque belli "genere

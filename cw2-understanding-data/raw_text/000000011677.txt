[Book IV. except that, as might be expected, the sophists made warmore against the popular faith, Carneades and his disciplesmore against their philosophical colleagues. On the otherhand Epicurus and Zeno agreed both in their aim of ration­ally explaining the nature of things, and in their physiolo­gical method, which set out from the idea of matter. Theydiverged, in so far as Epicurus, following the atomic theoryof Democritus, conceived the first principle as rigid matter,and evolved the manifoldness of things out of this mattermerely by mechanical variations; whereas Zeno, forming hisviews after the Ephesian Heraclitus, introduces even intohis primordial matter a dynamic antagonism and a move­ment of fluctuation up and down. From this are derived thefurther distinctions—that in the Epicurean system the godsas it were did not exist or were' at the most a dream ofdreams, while the Stoical gods formed the ever active soulof the world, and were as spirit, as sun, as God powerfulover the body, the earth, and nature; that Epicurus did not,while Zeno did, recognize a government of the world and apersonal immortality of the soul; that the proper object ofhuman aspiration was according to Epicurus an absoluteequilibrium disturbed neither by bodily desire nor by mentalconflict, while it was according to Zeno a manly activityalways increased by the constant antagonistic efforts of themind and body, and striving after a harmony with natureperpetually in conflict and perpetually at peace. But inone point all these schools were agreed with reference toreligion, that faith as such was nothing, and had necessarilyto be supplemented by reflection—whether this reflectionmight consciously despair of attaining any result, as did theAcademy, or might reject the conceptions of the popularfaith, as did the school of Epicurus, or might partly retainthem with explanation of the reasons for doing so, andpartly modify them, as did the Stoics. It was accordingly only natural, that the first contactof Hellenic philosophy with the Roman nation equally strongin faith and adverse to speculation was of a thoroughly hos­tile character. The Roman religion was entirely right indisdaining alike the assaults and the theoretic support ofthese philosophical systems, both of which did away with itsproper character. The Roman state, which instinctively feltitself assailed when religion was attacked, reasonably as­sumed towards the philosophers the attitude which a for­

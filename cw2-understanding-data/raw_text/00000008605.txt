It seems strange that Ancus should havebuilt ft wall on the right bank of the Tilwr when therewas yet none on the h-ft bank ; and it is remarkablethai Dionymiu (iii. 45), in describing the fortificationof the Janiculum, makes no mention of a wall, nor dowe hear of any gales on this side except that of thefortress itself. The existence of a wall, moreover,seems hardly consistent with the accounts which wehave already given from the same author of the de­fenceless state of the city on that side. Kiebuhr{Ht$t. i. p. 396) rejected the notion of a wall, asutterly erroneous, but unfortunately neglected togive the proofs by which he had arrived at this con­clusion.

II. Walls and Gates of Ait.euan and HONORIL'S. In the repairs of the wall by HoDOrioi all thegates of Aurelian vanished; hence it is impossible tosay with confidence that any part of Aureliau's wallremains: and we must consider it us represented bythat of Bonoriua. Procopius (B. G. iii. 24) assertsthat Totila destroyed all the gates; hut this is dis­proved by the inscriptions still existing over thePorta S. Lorenzo, as well as over the closed arch ofthe Porta Moggiort; and till the time of Pope UrbanVIII. the same inscription might be read over theOatienstS (/*. S. Paolo) and the ancient Portuensis.It can hardly be imagined that these inscriptions shouldhave been preserved over restored pates. The only no­tice respecting any of the gates of Aurelian on whichwe can confidently rely is the account given by Am-mianus Mareellinus (xvii. 4. § 14)of the carrying ofthe Egyptian obelisk,which Coa&tantiUS 11.erected illthe Circus Maxim us, through the Porta OsTIKKStS*It may be assumed, however, that their situationwas not altered in the new works of Honoring. Byfar the greater part of these gates exist at the pre­sent day, though some of them are now walled up,and in mast cases the ancient name has been changedfor a modern one. Hence the problem is not somuch to discover the sites of the ancient gates asthe ancient names o| tln.se stilt existing; ami thesedo not admit of much doubt, with the exception ofthe gates on the eastern side of the city. Procopius, the principal authority respecting thegates in the Aurelian (or Honorian) wall, enume­rates 14 piincipal ones, or iruAcu, and mentionssome smaller ones by the name of wvAioev (B. G.i. 19). The distinction, however, between thesetwo appellations is not very clear. To judge fromtheir present ap|»earance, it was not determined bythe size of the gates; and we find the Pinciana in­differently called irv\i\ and ffoATj. (Urlichs, Class.Mas. vol. iii. p. 196.) The conjecture of Nibby ( J/ura,<fc. p. 317) may perhaps be correct, that the wuAaiwere probably those which led to the great high­ways. The unknown writer called the Anonymusfcanaicdlensis, who flourished about the begiuning of the ninth century, also mentions H gates, md hvdudes the Pinciana among them; bat his sctssstis not clear. Unlike Sen ius, Aurelian did not consider theTat*a sufficient protection; and his walls were mmtdalong its banks from places opposite to the -f«t>**s»the walls which he built from the JuucuIoie termor. the further shore.

From blind and abject despair,Theodatus capriciously rose to groundless and fatalpresumption, and dared to receive, with menace andcontempt, the ambassador of Justinian; who claimedhis promise, solicited the allegiance of his subjects,and boldly asserted the inviolable privilege of hisown character. The march of Belisarius dispelledthis visionary pride; and as the first campaign wasemployed in the reduction of Sicily, the invasion ofItaly is applied by Procopius to the second year ofthe Gothic war. After Belisarius had left sufficient garrisons in BefeariusPalermo and Syracuse, he embarked his troops at JJaiy^dMessina, and landed them, without resistance, on «duces •i n a/~ii • Naples, the opposite shores of Rhegium.

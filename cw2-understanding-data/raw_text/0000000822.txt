OCR Output OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 67 The person, as well as the mind, of Constantine chap.had been enriched by nature with her choicest en- XV'dowments. His stature was lofty, his countenance His virtues.majestic, his deportment graceful; his strength andactivity were displayed in every manly exercise, andfrom his earliest youth, to a very advanced season oflife, he preserved the vigour of his constitution by astrict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastityand temperance. He delighted in the social inter­course of familiar conversation; and though he mightsometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with lessreseijfre than was required by the severe dignity ofhis station, the courtesy and liberality of his man­ners gained ^the hearts of all who approached him.The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected;yet he showed, on some occasions, that he was notincapable of a warm and lasting attachment. Thedisadvantage of an illiterate education had not pre­vented him from forming a just estimate of the valueof learning; and the arts and sciences derived someencouragement from the munificent protection ofConstantine. In the despatch of business, his dili­gence was indefatigable; and the active powers ofhis mind were almost continually exercised in read­ing, writing, or meditating, in giving audience toambassadors, and in examining the complaints ofhis subjects. Even those who censured the proprietyof his measures were compelled to acknowledge, thathe possessed magnanimity to conceive, and patienceto execute, the most arduous designs, without beingchecked either by the prejudices of education, or bythe clamours of the multitude. In the field, he in­fused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whomhe conducted with the talents of a consummate ge­neral; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune,we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtainedover the foreign and domestic foes of the republic. f 2

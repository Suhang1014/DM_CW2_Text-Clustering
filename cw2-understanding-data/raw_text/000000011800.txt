But even iuthe following generation the pontifex maximus QuintusScaevola (consul in 659; P. 219, 336) set forth at least inhis oral instructions in law without hesitation the proposi­tions, that there were two sorts of religion—one philosophic,adapted to the intellect, and one traditional, not so adapted;that the former was not fitted for .the religion of the stateas it contained various things which it was useless or eveninjurious for the people to know; and that accordingly thetraditional religion of the state ought to remain as it stood.The theology of Varro, in which the Roman religion is treatedthroughout as a state institution, is merely a further deve­lopment of the same principle. The state, according to histeaching, was older than the gods of the state as the painteris older than the picture; if the question related to makingthe gods anew, it would certainly be well to make and toname them after a manner more befitting and more intheoretic accordance with the parts of the world-soul, andto lay aside the images of the gods which only excitederroneous ideas,* and the mistaken system of sacrifice; but,since these institutions had been once established, every goodcitizen ought to own and follow them and do his part, thatthe " common man " might learn rather to set a higher valueon, than to contemn, the gods. That the common man, forwhose benefit the grandees thus surrendered their judgment,now despised this faith and sought his remedy elsewhere,was a matter of course and will be seen in the sequel.Thus then the Roman "high church" was ready, a sancti­monious body of priests and Levites, and an unbelievingpeople. The more openly the religion of the land wasdeclared a political institution, the more decidedly thepolitical parties regarded the field of the state-church asan arena for attack and defence; which was especially, ina daily increasing measure, the case with augural scienceand with the elections to the priestly colleges. The oldand natural practice of dismissing the burgess-assembly,when a thunder-storm came on, had in the hands of the * In Varro's satire, "The Aborigines," he sarcastically set forth how theprimitive men had not been content with the God who alone is recognized bythought, but had longed after puppets and effigies.

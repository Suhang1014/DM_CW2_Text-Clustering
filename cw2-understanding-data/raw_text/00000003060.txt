ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 333 Antony were to fight for the supreme power of the world; butHerod having enjoyed a country that was very fruitful, and thatnow for a long time, and having received great taxes, and raisedgreat armies therewith, got together a body of men, and care­fully furnished them with all necessaries, and designed them asauxiliaries for Antony: But Antony said, he had no want of hisassistance; but he commanded him to punish the king of Arabia;for he had heard both from him, and from Cleopatra, how per­fidious he was; for this was what Cleopatra desired, who thoughtit for her own advantage, that those two kings should do oneanother as great a mischief as possible.

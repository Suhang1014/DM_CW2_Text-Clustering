But the Menapii Btill maintained them­selves on the west Tacitus (Hift. iv. 28), in hisdescription of the rebellion of Civilis, still speaks ofthe "Menapins ct Morinos ct eitrema Galliarum."Part of the former territory of the Menapii wasfinallv included in Gemiania Inferior, and the restin Be'lgica, The name Menapii subsisted for a longtime, Aurclius Victor ((fc Caetaribut, 39) callsCarau-ius " Men.ipiae civis;" and it appears in themiddle ages. D'Anville observes that though theNotitia of the Empire mentions a body of soldiersnamed Menapii, we see no trace of this nation inany city which represents it; but\Valckenaer(G«)fl.<fc. vol. i. p. 460) contends that Turnacum(Timrnai) was their chief place, to which placeprobably belong the Belgic silver medals with thelegend DVRSAcvs (Bast, Kecueil, <fc.) "In anact of Charles the Bald, A. I>. 8+7. in favour of theabbey of St. Amand, which is south of Tournai, thisabbey is said to be 'in territorio Menapionim quodnunc Mempiscum appellant.'" We thus obtain, asit seems, a fixed point for part of the territory of theMenapii, which under the later Empire may havebeen limited to the country west of the Schelde. It is observed that u though it is very probablethat Caesar never advanced into the interior ofFlanders, it is, however, certain that the Romansafterwards, if they did not absolutely make them­selves masters of it, at least were there for sometime at different e|wchs. Their idols, their Dei Pe­nates, sepulchral urns, lamps, Roman utensils, andespecially the medals of almost all the emperors,discovered in great numbers, are irrefragable evi­dence ofthis." (Bast, liecutil dAntiquites Iiomainttet Gaulovtet, <fc., Introduction.) "Ancient earthen vessels have been found ingreat numbers all along the coast from Dunkerqueto Bruges, which shows that the sea has not gainedhere, and refutes the notion that in the time ofCaesar and Pliny this coast was neither inhabitednor habitable." (Walrkenaer.tsr'oo. <fc vol. i. p. 469.)An inscription found at Rimini, of the age of Ves­pasian, mentions the "Salinatores Menapiorum," orsalnnakers of the Menapii. If the position of the Meldi of Caesar has beenrightly determined [MEI.m], they were a Menapianpeople. There is nothing to show whether the Me­napii were Oalli or Germani. • [G.

It appears, from the account which Livy(i c.) gives of the expedition of Attains and theRomans (b.0.200), to have been a small maritimeplace under the dominion of Cassandria.

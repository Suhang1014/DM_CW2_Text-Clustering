The war with the Volsci wasconducted with more address; for, in the first baule theywere routed, and driven to Antium, a very rich city.Numicius not daring to besiege it took Cenon, anothercity belonging to the Antiates, but not so opulent as An­tium. \ Whilst the Romans were thus employed against the.SLqui and Volsci, the Sabines entered their territories,and advanced to the very gates of the city, plunderingthe country.

This place had been formerly fortified by theAcarnanians, who used it for the public tribunal of justice.It is distant from the city of Argos, which is also a maritimetown, about twenty-five stadia*. The Acarnanians werenow in motion, some running to the defence of Argos, othersto encamp at the important post of Crena in Amphilochia,to observe the motions of the Peloponnesians commanded byEurylochus, that they might not perfect their junction withthe Ambraciots, without some molestation on their route.They also send to Demosthenes the Athenian general in theiEtolian expedition, to come and put himself at their head ;and to the Athenian squadron of twenty sail, which was thenupon the coast of Peloponnesus, under the command of Aris­totle son of Timocrates, and Hierophon son of Antimnestus. The Ambraciots at Olpae sent also a messenger to theirown city, ordering them, to a man, to come out into thefield. They were afraid lest Eurylochus might not be ableto pass the Acarnanians, and so they should be compelledeither to fight alone ; or, should they attempt a retreat, tofind it full of danger. But the Peloponnesians commanded by Eurylochus hadno sooner heard that the Ambraciots were at Olpae, thandislodging from Proschium they marched with all expedi­tion to their support.

When they had passed through the ter­ritory of the Stratians, they crossed Phytia, and again throughthe extremity of Medeon, and then marched across Lim-naea. They now entered the kingdom of the Agraans,which had deserted the Acarnanian to favour the Pelopon-nesian interest. Securing then the mountain Thyamus, awild uncultivated spot, they crossed it, and descended thence About two miles and a. half.

The posi­tion assigned it by D'Anville at the modern Muscata certainly untenable. (lb. pp. 167, 168, 224. 233,234.) 2. A second harbour of this name is mentionedby the author of the Periplus, on the east of theSyagros Proroontorium, in the large bay named byPtolemy Sachalites Sinus (2axaAiT7js koAttov), andeast of the smaller one, named Omana ("Ojiora), bythe author of the Periplus, who places this MoschaPartus 1100 stadia east of Syagros. He calls it aport appointed for the lading of the Sachalite in­cense (Spuos awoocScry/ieVov toC XaxctKirov \i§d-rov Tpoi i^iSoAV), frequented by ships from Cane,and a wintering-place for late vessels from Limyriceand Barygaza, where they bartered fine linen, andcorn, and oil for the native produce of this coast. Mr.Forster furnishes an ingenious etymological explana­tion of the recurrence of this name on the coast ofthe Sachalites Sinus. "The Arabic Moscha, likethe Greek ajxdt, signifies a hide, or ikin, or a bagof skin or leather blwcn up like a bladder. Now,Ptolemy informs us that the pearl divers who fre­quented his Sinus Sachalites (unquestionably thesite of Arrian's Moscha Portus), were noted for thepractice of swimming, or floating about the bay,supported by inflated bides or skins. What moreDal aril than that the parts frequented by thesedivers should be named from this practice? . . .And hence, too, the name of the Ascitae of Ptolemy(' hunters on skins'), the actual inhabitants of hisMoscha Portus immediately west of his Suagros." Itis a remarkable fact mentioned by modern travellers,that this practice still prevails among the fishermenon this coast; for "as the natives have but fewcanoes, they generally substitute a single inflatedakin, or two of these having a flat board across them.On this frail contrivance the fisherman seats himself,and either casts his small hand-net or plays his hooksod line.'' (Lieut. Wellsted, Trarels in Arabia, vol. i.pp. 79, 80. cited by Forster, Arabia, vol. ii. p. 175,note*.) The identification of Arrian's Moscha withthe modern Ausera, is complete. Arrian reckons600 stadia from Syagros across the bay which henames Omana. This measurement tallies exactlywith that of the Bay of Seger, in Commodore Owen'schart of tills coast, and from the eastern extremity ofthis bay to Moscha Portus, Arrian assigns a dis­tance of 500 stadia, which measures with nearlyequal exactness the distance to Rn$-al-Sair (theAusara of Ptolemy), situated about 60 Roman milesto the east of the preceding headland. The identityOf the Moscha Portus of Arrian with the Ausara ofPtolemy is thus further corroborated. "Arrian stateshis Moscha Portus to have been the emporium ofthe incense trade; and Pliny proves Ausara to havebeen a chief emporium of this trade, by his noticeof the fact that one particular kind of incense borethe name of Aosaritis." (Plin. xii. 35; Forster,L e. pp. 176, 177.) [G. W.] MOSCHI (MAVxoi, Herat. Fr. 188, ap. Slepli. B.a. r.), a Colchian tribe, who have been identifiedwith the Mehhech of the prophet Ezekicl (xxvii.13; KnsenmUller, BibL Alterthumsk, vol. i. pt. i.p 248). Along with the Tibareni, Mosynaeii,Macrones, and Manlae, they formed the 19th sa­trapy of the Persian empire, extending along theSE. of the Euxine. and bounded on the S. by thelofty chain of the Armenian mountains. (Herod, iii. 94, vii. 78.) In the time of Strabo (xi. pp. 497—499) MoscmcE (Mo<rx"rfi) — in which was atemple of Leucothea, once famous for its wealth, butplundered by Phamaces and Mithridates — wasdivided between the Colchians, Albanians, andIberians (comp. Mela, iii. 5. § 4; Plin. vi. 4).Procopius (fi. G. iv. 2), who calls them MtVxoi,says that they were subject to the Iberians, and hadembraced Christianity, the religion of their masters.Afterwards their district became the appanage ofLiparites, the Abasgian prince.

Although it is obviously im­possible to fix the precise elevation to which theancients assigned this name, it may be generallydescribed as the chain of limestone mountains, withvolcanic rocks, and some granite, which, branchingfrom the Caucasus, skirts the E. side of Jmiretia,and afterwards, under the name of the PerengahTdgh, runs nearly SW. along the deep valley ofAjirah in the district of Tchildir; from whence itturns towards the S., and again to the \V. along thevalley of the Aeampsis, to the W. of which, bearingthe name of the Kop Tdgh, it enters Lesser Asia.(Ritter, Erdkunde, vol. x. p. 816; Chesney, Exped.Euphrat. vol. i. p. 235.) [E. B. J.] MUSE in Gallia appears in the Table on a roadfrom Durocortorum (Reims) to Meduantnm. [Me-duantum.] The place appears to be Mouzon onthe Mima. D'Anville says that the place is calledMosoniagus in the oldest middle age records. [G.L.] MOSELLA (Mosel, Moselle), a river of Gallia,whieh joins the Rhine at Coblenz [Confluemtks].In the narrative of his war with the Usipetes andTenctheri Caesar (£. G. iv. 15) speaks o{ drivingthem into the water M ad confluentem Mosae etRheni." One of the latest and best editors of Caesar,who however is singularly ignorant of geography,supposes this confluence of the Mosa and the Rhenusto be the junction of the Mosa and a part of theRhenus which is mentioned by Caesar in anotherplace (B. G. iv. 10; Mosa.) But this is impossible,as D'Anville had shown, who observes that theUsipetes [Menapii] had crossed the Rhine in thelower part of its course, and landed on the territoryof the Menapii. Having eaten them up, the invadersentered the country of the Eburones, which we knowto be between the Rhine and the Mosa, and highernp than the country of the Menapii. From theEburones the Germans advanced into the Condrusiin the latitude of Lkge; and they were here beforeCaesar set out after them. (B. G. iv. 6.) Caesar'snarrative shows that the German invaders were notthinking of a retreat; their design was to penetratefurther into Gallia, where they had been invited bysome of the Gallic states, who hoped to throw offthe Roman yoke. After the defeat of the Germanson the river, Caesar built his wooden bridge over theRhine, the position of which was certainly some­where between Coblenz and Andtrnach. The con­clusion is certain that this confluence of the Rhenusand the Mosa is the confluence of the Rhenus andthe MoseUa at Coblenz; and we must explain Caesar's B B 3

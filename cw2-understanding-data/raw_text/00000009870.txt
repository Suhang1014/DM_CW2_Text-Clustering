In both these respects, theyjudged their present posture the most judicious ; because itwas not their own business to attack, or voluntarily to run intoconflict and danger; and thus having manifestly exhibitedtheir alacrity to act defensively, a victory might justly be as­cribed to them without the expence of a battle. In re­gard further to the Megareans the consequence could notbut be fortunate: For, in case the latter had never beheldthem thus prompt in their succour, they would have stoppedall farther risk, and so undoubtedly they should have lostthe city, as men completely vanquished: But now, shouldthe Athenians decline an engagement, the points for whichthey themselves came thither must be secured without a blow ;which proved to be the result. For the MegarCans, whenthe Athenians came out and drew up in order close to thelong walls, and then, as the enemy did not advance to at­tack them, stood quiet in their ranks ; their commanders alsojudging the hazard by no means equal, and themselves, whohad so far been successful, not at all concerned to begin anengagement against superior numbers, in which, shouldthey prevail, they could only take Megara; but, should theymiscarry, must lose the flower of their domestic strength,especially as their opponents would act in probability withmore daring resolution, since, as the large strength they hadnow in the field consisted only of quotas from several con­stituents, they hazarded but little ; thus facing one anotherfor a considerable space, and neither side presuming to makean attack, till each at length wheeled off, the Athenians firsttowards Nisaea, and the Peloponnesians again to their for­mer post.—Then, I say, the Megareans in the interest of theexiles, regarding Brasidas as victor, aud animated by therefusal of attack on the Athenian 'side, open the gates ofMegara to Brasidas himself, and the several commandersfrom the auxiliary states; and, having given them admission,proceed with them to consultation, whilst the partizans ofthe Athenian interest were in the utmost consternation.

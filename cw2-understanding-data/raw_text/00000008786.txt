PROVINCIA. the Narbonitis," says Strabo, "has the same nature]products as Italia: but as we advance towards thenorth and the Cemmenon (Ct mint's), the landplanted with the olive and the fig terminates, but allthe other things are grown. The grape also does notripen well as we advance further north" (iv. p. 178).Strabo's remark about the olive is true. As weadvance from Xirnes by the great road to Clermont ,Ferrawl in the Aiirrrff/w, we ascend gradually in anorth-west direction to a rocky country well plantedwith vines, mulberry trees, and olives. After pro­ceeding a few miles further the olives suddenlydisappear, a sign that we have passed the limits ofthe temperature which they require. Tiie countryis now an irregular plateau, rocky and sterile, but inparts well planted with mulberries and vines; andthere is a little wheat. Before descending to An-dusia (Anduse), which is deep sunk in a gorge ofthe Vardo (Gtird<m), a few more olives arc seen, butthese are the hist. We are approaching the ruggedCeventux, The native population of the Provincia wereAquitani, Celtae, and Lignres. The Auuitaniwere in the parts along the base of the Pyrenees.The Ligures in the historical period occupied thesouth-east part of the Provincia, north and cast ofJfarsi illt, and it is probable that they were once onthe west side of the Rhone also. The Greeks wereon the coa>,t, cast and west of the city of Ma^-silia[Massilia]. After the country was reduced tothe form of a Provincia, the Italians flocked to theProvincia to make money. They were petty dealers(mercatores), bankers, and money-lenders (negoti-ntorcs), sheep-feeders, agriculturists, and traders.(Cic. pro P. Quintio, c. 'A, pro M. Fonteio, c.5.) The wine of Italy was imported into the Pro­vincia in,Cicero's time, and a duty was levied onit, if nut at the port, at least in its transit throughthe country (pre Fontttv, c. 9). Cicero sneeringlysays, " We Romans are the most just of men, for wedo not allow the Transalpine nations to plant theolive and the vine, in order that our olive plantationsand vineyards may be worth more" (f/<? Re PubU'-ti,iii. 9). It does not appear from Ckero when thisselfish order was made. Hut the vine is a native ofNarbonen-is, and the Greeks made wine, as we mightsafely assume, and they sold it to the Galli. Posi-donius, whom Cicero knew, and who had travelled inthe country, says that the rich Galli bought Italianwine and wine from the Mas-abuts. (Posidonius,up. Athen. iv. p. 152.) If any of the Galli gotthis wine, the Galli of the Provincia would have it. This favourite province of the Romans was full oflarge cities, which under the Empire were orna­mented with works both splendid and useful, am­phitheatres, temples, theatres, and aqueducts. Manyof these buildings have pe rial led, but the magnificentmonuments at Arh s anil Ntmcs, and the less strikingremains in other cities, show what this country wasunder Roman dominion. The tribes or peoples within the limits of theProvincia are very numerous. Pliny lias a long list.On the west side of the Rhone at the foot of thePyrenees were the Consorani and Sordoues or Sordi.North of them were the Voleae Tectosages, whosecapital was Tolosa; and the Ruteni Provinciales.The Voleae Arecomici occupied the country east ofthe Tectosages and extended to tin* Rhone.

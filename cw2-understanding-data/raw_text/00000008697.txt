OCR Output LYCASTUS. 223 I.YCIA. of all the other nations of Asia Minor, being succes­sively under the rule of Alexander the Great, theSi-leucidae, Antiochus, Eunienes of Pergamus, andfinally under the Romans. (Liv. xxvii. 54, xxxviii.39, 56.) Under this change of rulers, the characterof the people remained the same: daring and in­tractable, they still continued their wild and lawlesshabits, though in the course of time many Greeksettlers must have taken np their abode in theLycoonian towns. Under their chief Amyntas, how­ever, whom Strabo even calls king, and who was hisown coniejnporary, the country acquired a greaterpolitical consistency. [/>it'f. ofBioyr. under Amyn-tas. Vol. I. p. 156.] After the death of Amyntas,his whole kingdom, which he had greatly extended,fell into the hands of the Romans, who constitutedthe greater part of Lycaonia as a part of their pro­vince of Cappadocia. We may add, that Strabo regards lsauria as apart of Lycaonia. [Isacria.] [L.S.] LYCASTUS (Aukoittoj: Eth. AukoVtios), atown of Crete, mentioned in the Homeric catalogue(/£ ii. 647; comp. Pomp. Mela, ii. 7. § 13 J Plin.iv. 12). Strabo (x. p. 479) says that it had entirelydisappeared, having been conquered and destroyedby the Cnossians. According to Polybius (xxiii.15) the Lycastian district was afterwards wrestedfnrni Csossus by the Gortynians, who gave it to theneighbouring town of Rhaucus. In Mr. Pashlcy'smap the site is fixed at Kaenitria. (Hock, Kreta,vol i. pp. 15, 414.) [E. B. J.] LYCASTUS or LYCASTUM (AiWtoi), a veryancient town in Pontus, on a river bearing the samename. It was situated 20 stadia south-east ofArnisus. (Scyl. Peripl. p. 33; Marcian, p. 74; Pe-ripLPunt. F.tae. p. 10; Stcph. B. s.v. XaS.o-ia; I'lin.vi. 3; Mrla, i. 19, who calls it Lycasto.) Pherecydes(op. Scliol. ad Apoll. lihcxL ii. 373, comp. ad ii.1001) spoke of a town of Lycastia, inhabited byAmazon*, and situated between Themiscyra andCbaybia. The river Lycastua was but a smallstream, which after a short course emptied itselfiolo the Kuxine cl«*e by the town of Lyrastus.(ScjL, Marcian., Plin., U. cc.) [L. S.] LYCEIUM. [ Athknak, p. 303, b.]LYCHNIDUS (Ai>x>"°°»: >-'<*• AvX"iS'oi, Au-XH-njf.Steph. B.; Ptol. iii. 13. § 32), the chief townof the bassaretae in Illyricum. From its position(•n the frontier it was always a place of considerableimportance, and the name frequently occurs in thewars of the Romans with Philippus V. and Perseus,kmgt of Macedon. (Liv. xxvii. 32, xxxiii. 34.xliii. 9, 10, 21; Avx*'', Polyb. xviii. 30.)

Some geo- graphers have supposed that Achrida is the sameas Justiniana; this identification, which is a mis­take, has arisen from the circumstance that themetropolitans of Achrida called themselves after theemperor Justinian. Justiniana Prima is the moderntown of Kostendil. (Schafarik, Slur. Alt vol. ii.p. 227.) The Slavonic name survives in the modernAkridha, on the NE. shores of the lake. [E. B. J.] LYCHNITIS. 1. (Auxwtis, ij AvxftitaAiyan), Polyb. v. 108), a lake of Illyricum, firstmentioned by Scymnus of Chios (429). Philippushed his conquests over the Illyrian tribes as faras this lake (Diod. xvi. 8). The lake of Akridhaor Okridha, which abounds in fish (comp. Strab.vii. p. 327), represents Lychnitis. (Leake, NortheintGreece, vol. i. p. 328, vol.' iii. pp. 280,328.) 2. (Ai/x"*T'y i comp. Steph. B. s. v. Av%vt-oos), a lake of the Greater Armenia, whichPtolemy (v. 13. § 8) places in long. 78° and lat.43° 15'. It has been identified with the lakeGokdje Deniz, or Se.vanga to the N\V. of Erivan,the true position of which is lat. 40° 37'. The riverZengue, which flows out of the lake and communi­cates with the Araxea, is not mentioned by Ptolemy.(Dubois de Moutpereux, Voyage Autour tin Caucase,Atlas, pt. i. pi. vii. vol. iii. pp. 299—311; St. Martin,Hem. sw VArmenie, vol. i. p. 61: Jovrn.

It is bounded on the westby Caria, on the north by l'hrygia and Pisidia, andon the north-east by Pamphylia, while the wholeof the south is washed by the part of the Medi­terranean called the Lycian sea. The westernfrontier is formed by the river Glaucus and MountDaedala (Strab. xiv. p. 664), the northern by therange of Mount Taurus, and the eastern one byMount Climax. The whole extent of the country,from east to west, amounts, according to Strabo, to1720 stadia: this measurement, however, must havebeen made along the line of coast, for a straight linefrom east to west does not amount to more than one-half that distance. Its extent from the sea to thenorthern boundary is different in the different parts,but is everywhere smaller than that from east towest. Until very recently, Lycia, with its richremains of antiquity, was almost a terra incognita,— having never been visited by European travellers,until Sir Charles Fellows, in 1838, and a secondtime in 1840, travelled the country; since whichtime it has been explored and described by severalother men of learning and science, whose works willbe noticed below. 1. Name of the Country. — The name Lycia andLycians is perfectly familiar to Homer, and thepoet appears to have been better acquainted withLycia than with some other parts of Asia Minor, forhe knew the river Xanthus and Cape Chimaera.{II. vi. 171, &c, x. 430, xii. 312, &c, Od. v. 282,and elsewhere.) But, according to Herodotus (i.173), the ancient name of tho country had beenMilyas (?'; MiAi/ds), and that of the inhabitantsSolymi (2oAv>*oi), and Tremilae or Termilae (Tp«-/xiAai or Tfo^iAai). Thete latter are said tohave been conquered, and expelled from the coastdistricts by Siirpedon, the brother of Minos, who,with a band of Cretans, invaded the country andconquered it, but without changing either its nameor that of the people. But in his reign. Lye us, the

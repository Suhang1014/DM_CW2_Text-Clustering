Dante speaks of tlie environsof Pola, as in his lime remarkable for the numeroussarcophagi ami ancient tombs with which they wen1almost wholly occupied. These have, now disap­peared. (Dante, Jnf ix. 13.) The antiquities of Pola have been repeatedly de­scribed, ami illustrated with figures; among others,in the fourth volume of Stuart and Revett's Athens,fol. Loud. 1816, and in the Voyage Pittoresque deVhlrie et de la Dalmatie, fol. Paris, 1802; also inAlton's Antiquities of Pola. fol., Lond. 1819. The harbour of Pola is completely landlocked, soas to have the appearance of a small basin-shapedkike, communicating by a narrow channel with thesea. Off its entrance lies a group of small islandscalled the TsoU Brhni, which are probably thosecalled by Pliny Cissa and Pull aria. (Plin. iii. 26.s. 30.)

H. li.] POLEMO'NJUM (IlaXfjunior), a town on thecoast of Pontus, at the mouth of the small river Si-denus, 10 stadia from Phadisane, and 130 from CapeIasonium. (Arrian, Peripl. p. IG ; Anonym. Peripl.p. 11, &c; Ptol. v. 6. § 4; Steph. B. s. r.) Pliny(vi. 4) places tile town 120 Roman miles from Ami-sus, which seems to be too great a distance. (Comp.Aniiii. Mare. xxii. S; Microti, p. 702. where it is er­roneously called ToKffi6vtov; Tab. Penting.} NeitherStrabo nor any writer before him mentions this town,and it is therefore generally believed that it was builton the site of the town of Side, which is not noticed byany writer after Strabo. Its name intimates that itwas founded, or at all events was named, after onePolemon, perhaps the one who was made kins of thatpart of Pontus, about n. c. 36, by M. Antonius. It jhad a harbour, and seems to have in the course ,of time become a place of considerable import­ance, as the part of Pontus in which it was situatedreceived from it the name of Pontus Polemoniants.The town was situated on the western bank of theSidenus, where its existence is still attested by theruins of an octagon church, and the remains of amassive wall; but the ancient name of the place is )preserved by the village of Potdemnn, on the oppositeside of the river.

A town of Megaris, mentioned only in a lineof Homer, quoted by Strabo, for which the Athenianssubstituted another to prove that Salamis at thetime of the Trojan War was a dependency ofAthens. (Strab. ix. p. 394.) 4. (F.th. n«\ix''i'Tjjs), a town of Crete, whose |territory bordered upon that of Cydonia. (Time.'it. 85.) In b. C. 429 the Athenians assisted theinhabitants of Polielma in making war upon theCydonians. (Thuc. I c.) Herodotus also mentionsthe Policbnitae, and says that this people and thePraesii were the only people in Crete who did notjoin the other Cretans in the expedition against 1 Camicus in Sicily in order to revenge th* »V»tSiMinos (vii. 170; Steph. li. s. r.).

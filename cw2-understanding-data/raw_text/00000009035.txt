We now know that thiscountry was ruled in very early times by a Chaldacanrace, some of the kings of which Berosus has re­corded. (Rawlinson, tn Athenaeum, 1854, No. 1377;Euseb. Praepar. Ecang. ix. 17.) It is worthy ofnotice that Eusebius has preserved an ancientfragment from Eupolemus, who speaks of a city ofBabylonia,Camarina,'' which some call Urie(Oip'w)."As the Assyrian name of Warka is written with amonogram which signifies " the Moon," and as thename Camarina would naturally be derivable fromthe Arabic Kamar, " the Moon," there is an ad­ditional connection between the two names. (Euseb.L c.) It is also clear from the inscriptions that thenames of the two cities were constantly inter­changed. [V.] OKCHO'MENUS. 1. ('Opxo/ia>di; in insc. andcoins, 'HpxofuyJs: Eth. 'Opxontvtos, 'Epxo/icVtos),usually called the Minykan Orchohknus ('Opxo-u*vbs VLaittoi, Horn. IL ii. 511; Time. iv. 76; Strab.ix. p. 414), a city in the north of Boeotia, and inante-historical times the capital of the powerfulkingdom of the Minyae. This people, according totradition, seem to have come originally from Thessaly.We read of a town Minya in Thessaly (Steph. B.». p. Mirua), and also of a Thessalian OrchomenusMinyeus. (Plio. iv. 8. s. 15.) The first king of theBoeotian Orchomenus is said to have been Andreus,a son of the Thessalian river Peneius, from whomthe country was called Andreis. (Paus. ix. 34. § 6;ol 'Opxouivtoi aToiicol flat 0e<r<raAwir, Schol. adApoU. Rhod. ii. 1190.) Andreus assigned part of histerritory to the Aetolian Athamas, who adopted twoof the grandchildren of his brother Sisyphus: theygave their names to Haliartus and Coroneia. Andreuswas succeeded in the other part of his territory byhis son Eteocles, who was the first to worship theCharites (Graces) in Greece. Upon the death ofEteocles the sovereignty devolved upon the family ofHalmus or Almus, a son of Sisyphus. (Paus. ix.34.§7—ix.85.) Halmus had two daughters,Chryseand Chrysogeneia. Chryse by the god Ares becamethe mother of Phlegyas, who succeeded the childlessEteocles, and called the country Phlegyantis afterhimself. He also gave his name to the fierce andsacrilegious race of the Plilegyac, who separatedthemselves from the other Orchomenians. and at­tempted to plunder the temple of Delphi. They werehowever all destroyed by the god. with the exceptionof a few who fied into Phocis. Phlegyas died with­out children, and was succeeded by Ulnyses, the sonof Chrysojreneia by the god Poseidon. Chryses wasthe father of the wealthy Minyas, who built thetreasury, and who gave his name to the Minyan race.Minyas was succeeded by his son Orchomenus, afterwhom the city was named. (Paus. ix. 36. §§ 1—6.)Some modern scholars have supposed that the Minyaewere Aeolians (Thirlwall, Hist, of Greece, vol. i. p.91); but as they disappeared before the historicalperiod, it is impossible to predicate anything certainrespecting them. There is, however, a concurrenceof tradition to the fact, that Orchomenus was in theearliest times not only the chief city of Boeotia, butone of the most powerful and wealthy cities ofGreece. It has been observed that the genealogy ofOrchomenus glitters with names which express thetraditional opinion of bis unbounded wealth (Chryses,Chrysogeneia). Homer even compares the treasureswhich flowed into the city to those of the EgyptianThebes (//. ix. 381; comp. Eustath. /. c.) It wouldseem that at an early period Orchomenus ruled ov 1 I 4

Book XVI. cause of her love to her husband, and because Glaphyra seemedto behave herself somewhat insolently towards Salome's daugh­ter, who was the wife of Aristobulus, which equality of hersto herself Glaphyra took very impatiently. 3. Now, besides this second contention that had fallen amongthem, neither did the king's brother Pheroras keep himself outaf trouble, but had a particular foundation for suspicion and ha­tred; for he was overcome with the charms of his wife to sucha degree of madness, that he despised the king's daughter, towhom he had been betrothed, and wholly bent his mind to theother, who had been but a servant. Herod also was grieved bythe dishonour that was done him, because he had bestowed manyfavours upon him, and had advanced him to that height of powerthat he was almost a partner with him in the kingdom, and sawthat he had not made him a due return for his favours, and esteem­ed himself unhappy on that account. So upon Pheroras' un-woithy refusal, he gave the damsel to Phasaelus' son: but aftersome time, when he thought the heat of his brother's affectionswas over, he blamed him for his former conduct, and desiredhim to take his second daughter, whose name was Cypros. Pto­lemy also advised him to leave off affronting his brother, and toforsake her whom he had loved, for that it was a base thing tobe so enamoured of a servant, as to deprive himself of the king'sgood-will to him, and become an occasion of his trouble, and makehimself hated by him. Pheroras knew that this advice wouldbe for his own advantage, particularly because he had been ac­cused before, and forgiven; so he put his wife away, although healready had a son by her, and engaged to the king that he wouldtake his second daughter, and agreed that the thirtieth day aftershould be the day of marriage; and swore he would have nofarther conversation with her whom he had put away; but whenthe thirty days were over, he was such a slave to his affections,that he no longer performed any thing he had promised, but con­tinued still with his former wife. This occasioned Herod togrieve openly, and made him angry, while the king dropped oneword or other against Pheroras perpetually; and many made theking's anger an opportunity for raising calumnies against him.Nor had the king any longer a single quiet day or hour, but oc-easions of one fresh quarrel or another arose among his relations,and those that were dearest to him; for Salome was of a harshtemper, and ill-natured to Mariamne's sons; nor would she sufferher own daughter, who was the wife of Aristobulus, one ofthose young men, to bear a good-will to her husband, but per­suaded her to tell her if he said any thing to her in private,and when any misunderstandings happened, as is common, sheraised a great many suspicions out of it; by which means she

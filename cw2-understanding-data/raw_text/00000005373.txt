Theirhabit, their palace, their table were suited only to the rank of anopulent senator. Their family, however numerous or splendid,was composed entirely of their domestic slaves and freedmen **•Augustus or Trajaa wsuld have blushed at employing the meanestof the Romans in those menial offices, which, in the household andbedchamber of a limited monarch, are so eagerly solicited by theproudest nobles of Britain.

The Asiatic Greeks were the first inventors, the suc­cessors of Alexander the first objects, of this servile and im­pious mode of adulation. It was easily transferred from the kingsto the governors of Asia; and the Roman magistrates very fre­quently were adored as provincial deities, with the pomp of altarsand temples, of festivals and sacrifices **. It was natural that theemperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted, andthe divine honours which both the one and the other receivedfrom the provinces, attested rather the despotism than the ser­vitude of Rome.

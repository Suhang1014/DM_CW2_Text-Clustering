These examinations made me think it necessaryto inquire by torments what the truth was, which I did of twoservant maids, which were called deaconesses ; but still I dis­covered no more than that they were addicted to a bad andan extravagant superstition. Hereupon I have put off anyfarther examinations, and have recourse to you; for the affairseems to be well worth consultation, especially on account ofthe number of those that are in danger;2 for there are manyof every age, of every rank, and of both sexes, which are nowand hereafter likely to be called to account, and to be indanger; for this superstition is spread like a contagion, notonly into cities and towns, but irrtrrcountry villages also, whichyet there is reason-toTiopc may be stopped and corrected.

The sacrifices begin to sellwell everywhere, of which very few purchasers had of lateappeared; whereby it is easy to suppose how great a multi­tude of men may be amended, if place for repentance beadmitted. 1 This must most probably be the/«aj< of charily. * Some of late are very loath to believe that the Christians were numerousin the second century ; but this is such an evidence that they were very nu­merous, at least in Bithynia, even in the beginning of that century, as iswholly undeniable.

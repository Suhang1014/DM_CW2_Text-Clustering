OCR Output PREFACE. 6 likewise all the geographical, archaeological and historical il­lustrations, that are necessary to render the author intelligi­ble. The editor has at least endeavored to avoid the fault,which Lord Bacon says " is over usual in annotations andcommentaries, viz. to blanch the obscure places, and discourseupon the plain." But it has been his constant, not to say hischief aim, to- carry students beyond the dry details ofgrammar and lexicography, and introduce them into a famil­iar acquaintance and lively sympathy with the author and histimes, and with that great empire, of whose degeneracy anddecline,in its beginnings,he has bequeathed to us so profoundand instructive a history. It was for this end, that the Pre­liminary Remarks were composed ; and if they accomplishthis result in any considerable degree,, though long, they willhardly be thought too long, and they will not have beenwritten in vain. The Indexes have been prepared with much labor andcare, and, it is believed, will add materially to the value ofthe work. The editor takes this opportunity to express his gratefulsense of the kind reception which has been given to his edi­tion of the Germania and Agricola, and his thanks especiallyfor such notices, whether by letter or in the public journals,as, while they fully appreciate its merits, point out its faultsfor correction. If this edition is in any degree more merito­rious or less faulty, the superiority will be owing, in no smallmeasure, to such acts of kindness. Besides his obligations tothose who have thus favored him, he acknowledges his par­ticular indebtedness to Professor B. B. Edwards of Andover,and Professor H. B. Hackett of Newton, for the aid and en­couragement, which they have in various ways extended tohim. He has been aided in the correction of the press byMr. Marshall Henshaw, whose accurate and patient scholar­ship well fit him to render such and still higher services toclassical learning. 1*

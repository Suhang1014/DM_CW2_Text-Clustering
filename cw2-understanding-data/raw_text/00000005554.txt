Theylikewise know the natures prior to their own, and exercise a pro­vidential care over inferior concerns, without at the fame timehaving that propensity to such concerns which is found in thebulk of mankind. But the fouls which act erroneously accordingto the energies of both these circles, or which, in other words,neither exhibit accurate specimens of practical or intellectualvirtue—these differ in no respect from gregarious souls, or theherd of mankind, with whom the circle of sameness is fettered,and the circle of difference sustains all-various fractures anddistortions. As it is impossible, therefore, that these heroic souls can actwith equal vigour and perfection, according to both these circlesat once, at this is the province of natures more divine than the(human, it is necessary that they must sometimes descend andenergize principally according to their opinionative part, andsometimes according to their more intellectual part. Hence, oneof these circles must energize naturally, and the other be hinder­ed

RECHIUS. unknown: but in the reign of Tiberius the Reatineshad to contend against a more formidable danger,arising from the project which had been suggestedof Mocking up the outlet of the Lacus Velinus alto­gether; a measure which, as they justly complained,would undoubtedly have inundated the whole valley.(Tac. Ann. i. 7'J.) Similar disputes and difficultiesagain anise in the middle ages ; and in A. n. 1400a new channel was opened for the waters of the Ve­linus, which lias continued in use ever since. Xo other mention occurs of Keate under the Ro­man Empire; but inscriptions attest its continuedmunicipal importance : its name is found in theItineraries (Itin. Ant. p. 306), and it early becamethe see of a bishop, which it has continued eversince. Throughout the middle ages it was, as itstill continues to be, the capital of the surroundingcountry. No ancient remains are now visible atRit ti. * The territory of Reate was famous in ancienttimes for its breed of mules and asses ; the latterwere particularly celebrated, and are said to havebeen sometimes sold for a price as high as 300,000or even 400,000 sesterces (Varr. R.R. ii. S. § 3;Plin. viii. 43. s. 68), though it is difficult not tosuppose some error in these numbers. Hence, Q.Axius, a friend of Varro, who had a villa on theLacus Velinus, ami extensive possessions in theReatine territory, is introduced by Varro in his dia­logues f)e Re Ruxttca, as discoursing on the subject ofbreeding horses, mules, and asses. (Varr. R. R. ii.I. §8;Strab. v. p. 228.) It was at the villa of thisQ. Axius that Cicero lodged when he visited Reate.(Cic. ad Att. iv. 15.) The Septem Aquae, men­tioned by him in the same passage, and alluded toalso by Dionysius (i. 14), were evidently somesprings or source-, which supplied one of the smalllakes in the vallev of the Velinus.

Buttlie Redones were not on the Loire Pliny (iv. 18)enumerates the Rhedones among the peoples ofGallia Lugdunensis: " Diablindi, Rhedones, Turones."After the bloody tight on the Sambre (u. c. 57)Caesar sent P.

Caesar here enumeratesthe Redones among the maritime states whose ter­ritory extends to the ocean. In b. c. 52 the Re­dones with their neighbours sent a contingent toattack Caesar during the siege of Alesia. In thispassage also (Ii. G. vih 75), the Redones are enu­merated among the states bordering on the ocean,which in the Celtic language were called theArmoric States. D'Anviile supposes that their ter­ritory extended beyond the limits of tho diocese ofRennet into the dioceses of St. Malo and J>ol.

Armenian writers have supplied historical me­moirs to Georgia, though it has not been entirelywanting in domestic chronicles. These curiousrecords, which have much the style and appearanceof the half-legendary monkish histories of othercountries, are supposed to be founded on substantialtruth. One of the most important works on Georgianhistory is the memorials of the celebrated Orpelianfamily, which have been published by St. Martin,with a translation. Some account of these, alongwith a short sketch of the History of the Georgiansand their literature, will be found in Pilchard(Physical Hut. of Mankind, vol. iv. pp. 261—276).Dubois de Montpe'reux ( Vityaye autour du Caucate,vol. ii. pp. 8—1G9) has given an outline of thehistory of Georgia, from native sources; and themaps in the magniBcent Atlas that accompanies hiswork will be found of great service. [E. B. J.] IBERIA IXDIAE ('ICipio, PeripL M. K. p. 24,ed. Hudson), a district placed by the author of thePeriplus between Larica and the Scythians. It wasdoubtless peopled by some of the Scythian tribes,who gradually made their descent to the S. and SE.part of Scmde, and founded the Indo-Scythic empire,on the overthrow of the Greek kings of Bactria,about n. c. 136. The name would seem to implythat the population who occupied this district hadcome from the Caucasus. [**•] IBETtlCUM MAKE. rilispAMUM Mark.]IBK'UES, IBE'Ill, IBERIA.

P. from thetown of Vaiiia (Varea, in Buryat). Its chieftributaries were:—on the left, the Sicorm (Segre)and the Gallic is (Gallego), and on the right theSalo (.Won). It was long the boundary of thetwo Spains [IIispakia], whence prrhaps arose theerror of Appian (Hup. 6), who makes it divide thepeninsula into two equal parts. There are someother errors not worthy of notice. The origin of thename is disputed. Dismissing derivations from thePhoenician, the question seems to depend very muchon whether the Iberians derived their name from theriver, as was the belief of the ancient writers, orwhether the river took its name from the people, asW. von Humboldt contends. If the former was the-M*, and if Nicbobx'a view ia correct, that the popu- lation of NE. Spain was originally Celtic [Hts-pahia], a natural etymology is at once found in theCeltic aber, i. e. tcal'er.

[Attica, p. 328, K] ICA'KIUM MAKE. [Icahis; AegaeimMare.] ICARUS, 1'CARIA (*I«ropot. 'litapia: NUaria),an island of the Aegean, to the west of Samos, ac­cording to Strabo (x. p. 480, xiv. 639), 80 stadiafrom Cape Ampelos, while Pliny (v. 23) makes thedistance 35 miles. The island is in reulity a con­tinuation of the range of hills traversing Samos fromeast to west, whence it is long and narrow, and ex­tends from NE. to SW. Its length, according toPliny, is 17 miles, and its circumference, accordingto Strabo, 300 stadia. The island, which gave itsname to the whole of the surrounding sea (IcariumMare or Pelagut), derived its own name, accordingto tradition, from Icarus, the son of Daedalus, whowas believed to have fallen into the sea near thiaisland. (Ov. Mel. viii. 195, foil.) The cape form­ing tho easternmost point of the island was calledI>repanum or iJracnmun (Strab. xiv. pp. 637. 639;Horn. Hymn, xxxiv. 1; Diod. Sic. iii. 66; Plin. iv.23; Steph. B. t. r. Apaxovoy), and near it was asmall town of tho some name. Further west, anthe north coast, was the small town of Ian(*lo~Toi), with a tolerably good roadstead; to thesouth of this was another little place, called Oknok(OUAti, Strab. /. c; At lien. i. p. 30.) According tosome traditions, Dionysus was born on Cape Dra-conum (Throcrit, Idyll, xxvi. 33), and Artemis bada temple near Isti, called Tauropuliun. The islandhad received its first colonist* from Milrtua (Strab.xiv. p. 635); but in the time of Strabo it brloncedto the Samians: it had then but few iuhubiUiiU,and was uininly nseil by the Samians as pasture landfor their flock*.

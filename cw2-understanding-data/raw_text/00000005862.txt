Theseforces being assembled at Thermopylæ, as soon as it wasknown that the army of the Gauls had fixed their campsin the borders of Magnesia and Phthiotis, they sent a thou-*sand light-armed soldiers, and a chosen body of horse to theriver Sperchius, that the Barbarians might not pass overthe river without fighting their way, and being exposedto the danger of a defeat. These forces, therefore, whenthey came to the Sperchius, destroyed the bridges whichthe Gauls had raised on it, and fixed their camps on thebanks of the river. Brennus, indeed, was not unskilled inwarlike affairs, but for a Barbarian sufficiently acute, andexperienced in the stratagems of war. On the followingnight, therefore, leaving that part of the river on whichhe had raised the bridges, he sent ten thousand soldiers,who were skilled in swimming, and remarkably tall (forthe Gauls in general surpass other men in stature) to thelower parts of the river, that the Greeks might not per­ceive them as they were passing over-, and besides this,he knew that the river in this part spread itself widelyover the plains, and produced a marsh and lake insteadof a strong and narrow stream.. In the night, therefore,his forces swam over the marshy part of the river, someof them using their shields, which they call thureoi, forrafts, while others, who were taller than the rest, wadedthrough with their feet. The Greeks on the banks of theSperchius, as soon as they understood that the Barbarianshad passed over the marshy part of trie river, immediatelymarched back to their army. i CH AF.

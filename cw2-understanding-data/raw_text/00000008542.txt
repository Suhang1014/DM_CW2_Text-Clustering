D.] THU'RIA (&ovpia: Fill. eovptd-rns\ a town ofMessenia, situated in the eastern part of the southernMessenian plain, upon the river Aris (/VdViiwa), andat tbe distance of 80 stadia from l'harae, which wasabout a mile from the coast (I'aus. iv. 31. § 1). Itwas generally identified with the Homeric Antheia,though others supposed it to beAepeia. (Paus./. c;Strab. viii. p. 360.) It must have been a place ofconsiderable importance, since tbe distant Messeniangulf was even named after it (6 Bovptdrnf aoAror,Strab. I.e.). It was also one of the chief towns ofthe Lacedaemonian Perioeci after the subjugation ofMea-scnia ; and it was here that the Third MessenianWar took its rise, n. c. 464 (Thuc. i. 101). On therestoration of the Mcsscnians by Epaminoudas.Tliuria,like the other towns in the country, was dependentupon the newly-founded capital Messcne ; but afterthe capture of this city by the Achaeans in B. c. 182,Thuria, l'harae, and Abia joined the Achaean Leagueas independent members. (Polyb. xxv. 1.) Thuriawas annexed to Laconia by Augustus (Paus. /. c);but it was restored to Messenia by Tiberius. [Mes-sks'IA, p. 345, a.] Pausanus found two cities ofthis name. The Thuriatae had descended from tbesummit of the lofty hill of the upper city to dwellupon the plain ; but without abandoning altogetherthe upper city, where a temple of the Syrian goddeeastill stood within the town walls (Paus. iv. 31. § 2).There are considerable remains of both places. Thoseof Upper Thuria are on the hill of the village calledPaleokastro, divided from tbe range of mountainsnamed MakrypUi by a deep ravine and torrent, andwhich commands a tine view of the plain and gulf.The remains of the walls extend half a mile alongthe summit of the hill. Nearly in the centre of theruins is a quadrangular cistern, 10 or 12 feet deep,cut out of the rock at one end, ami on the other sideconstructed of masonry. The cistern was divided intothree parts by two cross walls. Its whole length is29 paces ; the breadth half as much. On tbe highestpart of the ridge there are numerous ruins, amongwhich are those of a small Doric temple, of a hardbrown calcareous stone, in which are cockle and muscleshells, extremely perfect. In the plain at Paled I.utraare the ruins of a large Roman building, standing in themiddle of fig and mulberry grounds. Leake observesthat "it is in an uncommon state of preservation, parteven of the roof still remaining. The walls are 17 feethigh, formed of equal courses of Roman tiles andmortar. The roof is of nibble mixed with cement.Tbe plan does not seem to be that of a bath only, aathe name would imply, though there are many ap­pearances of the building having contained bathe: itseems rather to have been the palace of some Roman 4 o 4

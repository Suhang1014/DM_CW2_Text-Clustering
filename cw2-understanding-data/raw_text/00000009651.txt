Their private properties he left to them entire, but madethem rest contented with Athens alone for their city;which, when all its subjects were now jointly contributingto its support, was quickly enlarged, and delivered so byTheseus to the succeeding kings. In memory of this, fromthe days of Theseus quite down to the present time, theAthenians have held an anniversary solemnity to the Goddess,which they call Synctcia or Cohabitation. Before this, thatwhich is now the Citadel, and that part which lies onthe south-side of the citadel, was all the city. The templesbuilt either within the citadel or without sufficiently shewit. For in the south-part of the city, particularly, stand thetemples of the Olympian Jove, of the Pythian Apollo, ofTerra, and of Bacchus in Linn*, in honour of whom theold Bacchanalian feasts are celebrated on the twelfth day ofthe month Anthesterion*: which custom is still retainedto this day by the Ionians of Attic descent.

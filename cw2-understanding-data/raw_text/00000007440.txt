Now, this Agrippa, with relation to Caius, didwhat became one that had been so much honoured by him; forhe embraced Caius's body after he was dead, and laid it upon abed, and covered it as well as he could, and went out to theguards, and told them that Caius was still alive ; but he said thatthey should call for physicians, since he was very ill of hiswounds. But when he had learned that Claudius was carriedaway violently by the soldiers, he rushed through the crowd tohim, and when he found that he was in disorder, and ready toresign up the government to the senate, he encouraged him, anddesired him to keep the government; but when he had said thisto Claudius, he retired home. And, upon the senate's sendingfor him, he anointed his head with ointment, as if he had latelyaccompanied with his wife, and had dismissed her, and theacame to them : he also asked of the senators what Claudius did ;who told him the present state of affairs, and then asked his opi­nion about the settlement of the public.

B. i. r.) 1PSUS ("IuVoor or'I+oi), a small town of I'hry-gia, a few miles below Synnada. The place itselfnever was of any particular note, but it is celebratedin history fir the great battle fought in its plains,It. c. 301, by the aged Antigonus and his son De­metrius against the combined forces of Cassandcr,I.ysiniachuii, Ptolemy, and Seleucus, in which An­tigonus lost his conquests and his life. (Plut Pyrrh.4; Appian, Syriac. 55.) From Hierocles (p. 677)and the Acts of Councils (ConciL .\icaen, ii. p. 161),we learn that in the seventh and eighth centuries itwas the see of a Christian bishop.

Or Kiba (E/po), a mountain in Messenia,which the Mesaeniaiu fortified in the Second Messe-nian War, and which Aristomenes defended for tenyears against the Spartans, It was in the north ofMessenia, near the river Neda. Leake pl.ieea it atno great distance from tlie sea, under the aide of themountain on which now stands Sittheruhutro andMdrmaro; but tliere are no ancient remains in thisspot. More to the east, on tlie left bank of the Neda,near KakaUtri, are the remains of an ancient fortress,which was, in all probability, Kira; and the loftymountain above, now called Tetrdti, was probably the highest summit of Mount Kirn.

IKENOTOLIS (EijnjKJiroXij), a town of the dis­trict Lacunitis, in tho north-east of Cilicia. It wassituated not far from tho river Calycadnus, and issaid to have once home the name of Xcronias (Ncpv-ki'oj). (Theoiloret. llitt. Kccla. i. 7, ii. 8; Socrat. u.26; PtoL t. 8. § 6.) [L.

Iricnsis: Voghcrn). aconsiderable town of the interior of Liguria, men­tioned both by I'liny and Ptolemy, as well as in tlieItineraries, which place it 10 miles from Dertona, onthe raid to Placcntia. (Plin. iii. 5. a. 7; Ptol. iii.1. § 35; /(in. Ant. p. 288; Tab. Petit.) Thia dis-tance agrees with tlie site of the modern town <■:Voghera, which apiiears to hate been called in tlmmiddle ages I'ictw trine, a name pradnally corruptedinto its modern appellation. It is situated on thelittle river Stajfora, which would seem to hate bornein ancient times the same name with the city: it iscalled Hiria or Iria by P. Diacunus, whotelU us thaithe emperor Majoriaims was put to death on itsbanks. (//«(. Miscell. xvi. p. 554.) Ptolemy in­cludes Iria, as well as Dertona, in the territory ofthe Taurini; but this would seem to be certainly amistake: that people could never have extended sofar to tho eastward. An inscription (of which listreading is, however, a matter of controversy) has'"Coloniae Foro Juli Iriensium," from which it wou. Iseem that Iria, as well as the neighbouring Dertona,became a colony after the death of Caesar, and ob­tained the name of Forum Julii; but thia u verydoubtful. No other trace is found either of the lian.cor the colony. (Mafl'ei, -1/im. Ver. p. 371.4; Muni.fmcr. p. 1108. 4; Orel). hucr. 73.) [E. H.

S.] IRIS (4'lJNi: Kasalmal), a considerable river ofPontus, which has its souncs in the heights of Anti-taurus in the south of Pontus. It flows at first ma north-western direction, until reaching Cu:tm:uit takes a western turn: it thus passes by thetowns of Meayla and Gaziura. A little above Ami-sus it receives the ScyUx, and turns eastward; n< *rKupatoria the Lye us empties itself into it. Alterthb it flows due north, and, traversing the plain ofThcmiscyra, it empties itself into the Kuxine by fourmouths, the westernmost of which is the mint impor­tant (Strab. xii. p. 556.) The Iris is smaller titanthe Hairs (Apollon.

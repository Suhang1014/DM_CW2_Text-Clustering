OCR Output OF THE 110MAN EMPIRE. 431 of Ambrose; the disinterested advice of Theodosius chap.was the general result of piety and friendship; and XXI1'the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile andambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul. The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace Maximusand prosperity, could he have contented himself with itaiy,the possession of three ample countries, which now August,87constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms ofmodern Europe. But the aspiring usurper, whosesordid ambition was not dignified by the love of gloryand of arms, considered his actual forces as the in足struments only of his future greatness, and his suc足cess was the immediate cause of his destruction.The wealth which he extorted from the oppressedprovinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employedin levying and maintaining a formidable army ofBarbarians, collected, for the most part, from thefiercest nations of Germany. The conquest of Italywas the object of his hopes and preparations; and hesecretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth,whose government was abhorred and despised by hisCatholic subjects. But as Maximus wished to oc足cupy, without resistance, the passes of the Alps, hereceived, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of Syria,the ambassador of Valentinian, and pressed him toaccept the aid of a considerable body of troops forthe service of a Pannonian war. The penetration ofAmbrose had discovered the snares of an enemyunder the professions of friendship; but the SyrianDomninus was corrupted or deceived, by the liberalfavour of the court of Treves; and the council ofMilan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger,with a blind confidence, which was the effect, not ofcourage, but of fear. The march of the auxiliarieswas guided by the ambassador; and they were ad足mitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the Alps.

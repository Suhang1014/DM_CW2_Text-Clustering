For as to us Romans,no part of the habitable earth hath been able to escape ourhands hitherto; but as for the Jews, that I may speak of themtoo, though they have been already beaten, yet do they notgive up the cause; and a sad thing it would be for us to growweary under our good success, when they bear up under theirmisfortunes. As to the alacrity which you show publicly, Isee it, and rejoice at it; yet am I afraid lest the multitudeof the enemy should bring a concealed fright upon some ofyou: let such a one consider again who we are that are tofight, and who those are against whom we are to fight.

Those pas­sions, indeed, make a great figure when they succeed, but arcquite extinguished upon the least ill success: but wc are ledon by courage, and obedience, and fortitude, which shows it­self, indeed, in our good fortune, but still does not for cvcidesert us in our ill fortune.

Now what juster opportunity shall they ever have ofrequiting their generals, if they do not make use of this thatis now before them ? while there are so much juster reasonsfor Vespasian's being emperor than for Vitellius, as they arethemselves more deserving than those that made the otheremperors; for that they have undergone as great wars ashave the troops that come from Germany; nor are they infe­rior in war to those that have brought that tyrant to Rome,nor have they undergono smaller labors than they ; for thatneitner will the Roman senate nor people bear such a lasci­vious emperor as Vitellius, if he be compared with their chasteVespasian ; nor will they endure a most barbarous tyrant in­stead of a good governor, nor choose one that hath no child1to preside over them, instead of him that is a father, becausethe advancement of men's own children to dignities is cer­tainly the greatest security kings can have for themselves.Whether, therefore, we estimate the capacity of governingfrom the skill of a person in years, we ought to have Vespa­sian, or whether, from the strength of a young man, we oughtto have Titus; for by this means we shall have the advantageof both their ages, for that they will afford strength to thosethat shall be made emperors, they having already three le­gions, besides other auxiliaries from the neighboring kings, 1 The Roman authors that now remain say Vitellius hail children, whereasJosephus introduces here the Roman soldiers in Judea, saying he had none.Which of these assertions was the truth I know not. Spanheim thinks h«hath given a peculiar rcason for calling Vitellius childless, though he reallyhas children. Diss, de Num. pages 649, 650, to which it appears very diffi­cult to give our assont.

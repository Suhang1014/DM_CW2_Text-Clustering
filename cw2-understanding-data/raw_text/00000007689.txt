ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 19 4' put to the torture thyself, while thou alledgest, that the tor-" tures of those already examined thereby have made them tell'' lies ; that those that have been the deliverers of thy father may«' not be allowed to have spoken the truth : but that thy tortures" may be esteemed the discoverers of truth. Wilt not thou, O Va-'' rus ! deliver the king from the injuries of his kindred ? Wilt not" thou destroy this wicked wild beast, which hath pretended kind-"'' ness to his father, in order to destroy his brethren ; while yet he'' is himself alone ready to carry off the kingdom immediately," and appears to be the most bloody butcher to him of them all ?"

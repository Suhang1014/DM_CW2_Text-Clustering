As this man was walking before Susa, the metropolis ofthe Persians, he heard some strangers that were entering the cityafter a long journey, speaking to another in the Hebrew tongue,so he went to them and asked them whence they came? Andwhen their answer was, that they came from Judea, he began toinquire of them again in what state the multitude was? and inwhat condition Jerusalem was; nnd when they replied, that theywere in a * bad state, for that their walls were thrown down tothe ground, and that the neighbouring nations did a great deal o.mischief to the Jews, while in the day time they overran thecountry, and pillaged it, and in the night did them mischief, in­somuch that not a few were led away captive out of the country,and out of Jerusalem itself, and that the roads were in the daytime found full of dead men.

Ann. 3, 9: in agmine atque itinere ; and that in generalagmen denotes the troops on the march, and iter the march itself.Here, however, he says in agmine is antithetic to in stationibus, andhe explains in agmine by ubi copiae essent conjunctae; and in sta­tionibus by ubi singuli milites versarentur. Doderlein says: in itinere,dum iter faciunt; in agmine, dam ambulant, exercendi causa. Orelli-has still another way of distinguishing the phrases. Render in itinere,on the march; in agmine, in the lines; in stationibus, at theiiquarters. 23*

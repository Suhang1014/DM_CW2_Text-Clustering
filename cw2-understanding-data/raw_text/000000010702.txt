ROMAN HISTORY. 211 der the pressure of these calamities, advices all of a sud­den were brought from the Hernici, that the confederateforces of the /Lqui and Hernici had encamped in theircountry, and were proceeding with a huge army to pil­lage their lands. A thin senate easily discovered to theallies, how much the city had been reduced by the plague,and, besides, carried back this uncomfortabte answer:That the Hernici, in conjunction with the Latins, mustfor this time depend entirely upon their own internalresources, for the anger of the gods had depopulatedRome by a sudden plague. Should the rage of thepestilence subside, they would not be wanting to givetheir allies the assistance they had afforded them lastyear, and on other occasions." Upon this they de­parted more disconsolate than they had set out; for theycould not of themselves support a war, which they couldonly maintain with difficulty, sustained by the Romanensigns. The enemy did not make a long stay in the countryof the Hernici, but marched in a hostile manner into theterritories of Rome, which were desolate enough withoutthe calamities of war. Meeting nobody with or with­out arms, and finding every thing defenceless and evenuncultivated, they penetrated by the Gabinian way,within three miles of Rome. /Ebutius, one of the con­suls was dead; Servilius his colleague was scarce alive,and most of the nobility were affected, as were the great­er part of the fathers, and also every one else fit to beararms; insomuch, that so far from having forces to stem.the torrent of the war, with which they were threatenedat present, they had not a sufficient number of guardsfor common duty. The senators, whose age and healthpermitted them, mounted guard in person, and stoodsentry. The .ffidiles went the rounds and gave orders:For on them the administration of government, togetherwith the consular authority, had totally devolved.

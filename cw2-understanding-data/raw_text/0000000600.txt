When I liveda private quiet life, I left those good things,which by my own diligence, and by thy coun­sel, I enjoyed with Raguel, my father-in-law;and I gave myself up to this people, and un­derwent many miseries on their account. Ialso bore great labours; at first, in order toobtain liberty for them, and now in order totheir preservation; and have always shewedmyself ready to assist them in every distress.Now, therefore, since I am suspected by thosevery men, whose being is owing to my la­bours; come thou, as it is reasonable to hopethou wilt: thou, I say, who shewedst me thatfire at mount Sinai, and madest me to hear itsvoice, and to see the several wonders whichthat place afforded; thou, who commandedstme to go to Egypt, and declare thy will tothis people; thou, who disturbedst the happyestate of the Egyptians, and gavedst us theopportunity of flying from our slavery underthem, and madest the dominion of Pharaohinferior to my dominion; thou, who didstmake the sea dry land for us, when we knewnot whither to go, and didst overwhelm theEgyptians with those destructive waves whichhad been divided for us; thou, who didst be­stow upon us the security of weapons whenwe were naked; thou, who didst make thecorrupted fountains to flow so as to be fit fordrinking; and didst furnish us with water thatcame out of the rocks, when we were in thegreatest want of it; thou, who didst preserveour lives with quails, which was food fromthe sea, when the fruits of the ground failedus; thou, who didst send us such food fromheaven, as had never been seen before; thou,who didst suggest to us the knowledge of thylaws, and appoint us a form of government:Come thou, O Lord of the whole world, andthat as such a judge and a witness to me ascannot be bribed; and show how I havenever admitted of any gift against justice fromany of the Hebrews; and have never con­demned a poor man, that ought to have beenacquitted on occount of one that was rich;and have never attempted to hurt this com­monwealth: I am now here present, and amsuspected of a thing the remotest from my in­tentions: as if I had given the priesthood toAaron, not at thy command; but out of my own favour to him. Do thou at this time de­monstrate, that all things are administered bythy providence, and that nothing happens bychance, but is governed by thy will, andthereby attains its end; as also demonstratethat thou takest care of those that have donegood to the Hebrews. Demonstrate this, Isay, by the punishment of Abiram and Da-than, who condemn thee as an insensible be­ing, and one overcome by my contrivances.This wilt thou do by inflicting such an openpunishment on those men, who so madly flyin the face of thy glory, as will take them outof the world, not in an ordinary manner, butso that it may appear that they do not die asother men go out of the world: let that groundon which they tread open about them, withtheir families and goods. This will be a de­monstration of thy power to all men; and thismethod of their sufferings will be an instruc­tion of wisdom for those that entertain pro­found sentiments of thee. By this means Ishall be found a good servant, in the preceptsthou hast given by me. But if the calumniesthey have raised against me be true, mayestthou preserve these men from every evil ac­cident, and bring all that destruction on me,which I have imprecated upon them. Andwhen thou hast inflicted punishment on thosethat have endeavoured to deal unjustly withthis people, bestow upon them concord andpeace. Save this multitude that follow thycommandments, and preserve them free fromharm: and let them not partake of the punish­ment of those that have sinned. For thouknowest thyself, it is not just that for thewickedness of those men, the whole body ofthe Israelites should suffer punishment." When Moses had said this with tears in hiseyes, the ground was moved on a sudden;and the agitation that set it in motion waslike that which the wind produces in wavesof the sea. The people were all affrighted,and the ground that was about their tentssunk down at that terrible sound, and carriedwhatsoever was dear to the seditious into it­self; who so entirely perished, that there wasnot the least appearance that any men hadever been seen there: the earth that hadopened itself about them closing again, andbecoming entire as it was before: insomuch,that such as saw it afterward did not perceive -\

Several acts of his even during his tribunesbipare mentioned, which betray the very opposite of demagogicdesigns. For instance, he prevented by his veto one of hiscolleagues from cancelling through a decree of the people thesentences of jurymen issued under the Varian law; and whenthe late aedile Gaius Caesar unconstitutionally became a can­didate for the consulship, passing over the praetorship withthe design, it was alleged, of getting the charge of the Asiaticwar afterwards intrusted to him, Sulpicius opposed himmore resolutely and sharply than any one else.

The recall of those condemned by the Varian jury­men no doubt Sacrificed the principle of the inviolabilityof such decisions, which Sulpicius himself had just practi­cally defended; but it tended mainly to benefit in the firstinstance the members of the proposer's own party, themoderate conservatives, and it may be very well conceivedthat so impetuous a man might when first coming forwarddecidedly combat such a measure and then, indignant at the

ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 119 and not to think it a dishonourable thing in her to put on ahumble habit, for the safety of her nation, wherein she mightdeprecate the ruin of the Jews, who were in danger of it; for thatHaman, whose dignity was only inferior to that of the king's,had accused the Jews, and had irritated the king against them.When she was informed of this, she sent to Mordecai again,and told him that she was not called by the king, and that hewho goes in to him without being called, is to be slain, unlesswhen he is willing to save any one, he holds out his golden scep­tre to him; but that to whomsoever he does so, although he goin without being called, that person is so far from being slain,that he obtains pardon, and is entirely preserved. Now whenthe eunuch carried this message from Esther to Mordecai, hebade him also tell her that she must not only provide for her ownpreservation, but for the common preservation of her nation, forthat if she now neglected this opportunity, there would certainlyarise help to them from God some other way, but she and herfather's house would be destroyed by those whom she now de­spised.

Thesame supplications did the multitude put up; and entreated thatGod would provide for their deliverance, and free the Israelitesthat were in all the eaith from this calamity which was nowcoming upon them, for they had it before their eyes, and ex­pected its coming. Accordingly Esther made supplication toGod after the manner of her country, by casting herself downupon the earth, and putting on her mourning garments, and bid­ding farewell to meat and drink; and all delicacies, for three days,

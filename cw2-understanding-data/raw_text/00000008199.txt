Ann. xiii. 54), andin a. i>. 83 a detachment of them is mentioned asserving in the Roman army in Britain. (Id. Agr'ic.27.) Afterwards they disappear from history.(Comp.

On the land side it was protected by steephills, which, together with the sea and its artificial de­fences, which were carefully kept up, rendered it a verystrong place. (Liv. xxix. 35; App. Pun. 16, 30, 75;Diod. xx. 54; Plut.Cat. Min. 58.)

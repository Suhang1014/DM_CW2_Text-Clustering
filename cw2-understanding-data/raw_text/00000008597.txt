TARALA (Trf&zAa), a town of F.ydia near theriver Hermus, is known only from coins found inthe country; but it is no doubt the same :is the onementioned by Hierocles (p. 670) under the name ofGabala, which is perbapi only miawritten for Tabala.It is even possible that it may be the town of Tabaewhich Stcphanus ftyz. assigns to Lydia. Some traceof the ancient place seems to be preserved in thename of the village Tonbaili on the left bank of theHermus. between Adtda and Kutn. [L.

Tabernae is mentioned byAmtnianns Marcellinus (xvi. 2), unless in this paa-sairc lie means another place (No. 2) which has thewiine name. 2. Between Argentoratum (Stra&shurg) and Divo-duruni (Metz) is EUatz-Zab<m, or Snvetme. as theTrench call it, which is about 21 miles from Strtiss-hurg. This seems to Ik? the place which Ammianus(xvi. 11) calls Tres Tal>ernae. When .Julian wasmarching against the Alemanni, who were eiicamjM'dnear Argcntoratum, be rejaired Tres Tabernae, forthe purpose of preventing the Germans from enteringGallia by this pass in the Vosgts. Ammianus (xvi.12) also gives the distance from Tres Taliernae tothe German camp at Argentoratutn at 14 " leugae,**which is 21 Roman miles, and agrees very well withthe distance between Saverrie and Strassbury (D'An-ville, Xoiice. tf-c.). 3. Tabernae is mentioned by Ausonius (Moselta,v. 8) on the road between llingium (/iingeti) andNoviomagus (X<nmagen); but the geographers arenot agreed alwut the position, whether it is Bergza-6em, a place which is out of the way, BaUlenau, orJUnicaslel on the Motel.

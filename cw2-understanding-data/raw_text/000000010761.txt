IMMEDIATELY after this, a war with the Sabinesmenaced Rome, but it was father a tumult than a war.The city was alarmed in the night, with an account, thatthe Sabine army was ravaging the country, and had ad­vanced as far as the Anio, plundering and burning allthe (arm-houses in their «ay. A. Posthufnius, who hadbeen dictator in the war with the Latins, was immedi­ately sent against them with the cavalry, and the consulServilius followed him with a select body of infantry.Most of the stragglers were cut oil' by the horse, and theresistance the Sabine legions made against the foot, whenthey came up with them, was not vigorous. Exhaustedwith their march, and plundering the country in thenight, and many of them overcharged with eating anddrinking in .the houses as they had come along, had notstrength enough Heft to carry them away. The war with the Sabmes being begun and ended thesame night, the next day, when the Romans thoughtthey had now secured peace with all their neighbours,• he ambassadors of the Arunci came to the senate,threatening them with an immediate declaration of war,if they did not withdraw their troops from the territoryof the Volsci. At the same time that the couriers tooktheir departure for Rome, the army of the Arunci begantheir march, The report that it was seen near Aricia,occasioned such hurry and confusion at Rome, that thesenate could not be properly consulted, and whilst theywere arming themselves, they could not give a deliberateanswer to those who had laid them uuder that necessity.They immediately march for Aricta with a hostile army,nor was it far from thence, that they came' up with the-Arunci, whom they discussed in one battle.

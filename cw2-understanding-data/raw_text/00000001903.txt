He pa­tiently endured the hardships of a savage life, and rejectedwith disdain, the specious temptations of,;the Persiancourt. The king of the Lazi had been educated in theChristian religion; his mother was the daughter of a se­nator; during his youth, he had served ten years a silen-tiary of the Byzantine palace,5 and the arrears of an un­paid salary were a motive of attachment as well as ofcomplaint. But the. long continuance of his sufferingsextorted from him a naked representation of the truth;and truth was an unpardonable libel on the lieutenantsof Justinian, who, amidst the delays of a ruinous war,had spared his enemies, and trampled on his allies.Their malicious information persuaded the emperor, thathis faithless vassal already meditated a second defection:an order was issued to send him prisoner to Constanti­nople; a treacherous clause was inserted, that he mightbe lawfully killed in case of resistance; and Gubazes,without arms, or suspicion of danger, was stabbed in thesecurity of a friendly interview. In the first momentsof rage and despair, the Colchians would have sacrificedtheir country and religion to the gratification of revenge.But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few, ob­tained a salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis re­stored the terror of the Roman arms, and the emperorwas solicitous to absolve his own name from the imputa­tion of so foul a murder.

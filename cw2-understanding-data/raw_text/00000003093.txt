However, Alexan­der went over all the country round about, and armed manyof the Jews, and suddenly got together ten thousand armedfootmen, and fifteen hundred horsemen, and fortified Alexan-drium, a fortress near to Corae and Macherus, near the moun­tains of Arabia. Gabinius therefore came upon him, having'sent Marcus Antonius, with other commanders before.

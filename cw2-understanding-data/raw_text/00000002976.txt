And this was the fate of Hyrcanus; and thus did he endhis iife, after he had endured various and manifold turns of for­tune in his lifetime: For he was made high priest of the Jew­ish nation in the beginning of his mother Alexandra's reign,who held the government nine years; and when, after his mo­ther's death, he took the kingdom himself, and held it threemonths, he lost it, by the means of his brother Aristobulus.He was then restored by Pompey, and received all sorts of ho­nour from him, and enjoyed them forty years; but when hewas again deprived by Antigonus, and was maimed in his body,he was made a captive by the Parthians, and thence returnedhome again after some time, on account of the hopes that He­rod had given him; none of which came to pass according tohis expectation, but he still conflicted with many misfortunesthrough the whole course of his life; and what was the heaviestcalamity of all, as we have related already, he came to an endwhich was undeserved by him.

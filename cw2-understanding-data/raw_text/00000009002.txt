Ptol. ii. 6. § 56), a town ofthe Arevaci in Hispania Tarraconensis [T. H. D.] TUDE (ToSSat and Tovvdat, Ptol. ii. 6. $ 45), afort or castle of tlie Gruii or Grav'ii, in HispaniaTarraconensis, K. of Limia, and on the road fromBracara to Asturica. (/tin. Aid. p. 4'2'J.) It iscalled Tyde by Pliny (iv. 20. s. 34), and accordingto an ancient tradition it was the seat of an Aetoliancolony under Diomed; a tale probably occasioned bythe similarity of its name to that of Tydcus. (SiLItal. iii. 367, xvi. 309; Plin. /.c.; Avien. Dttcr.Orb. 650.) It is the modern Tuy. [T. H. !>.] TUDER (TovScp: Eth. Tudertinua: Totli), oneof the most considerable cities of Umbria, situatedon a lofty hill, rising above the left bank of theTiber, about 26 miles S. of Perusia and 18 W. ofSpoletium. There is no doubt that it was an ancientUmbriun city, but no mention of the name occurs inhistory previous to the Roman conquest. .Sitinsltalicus tells us that it was celebrated for the worshipof Mars (Sil. Ital. iv. 222, viii. 462), and noticesits position on a lofty bill. (Id. vi. 645.) Thefirst notice of it in history is on occasion of a pro­digy which occurred there at the time of the inva­sion of the Cimbri and Tcutones (Pint. Mar. 17;Plin. ii. 57. s. 58); and shortly after we learn thatit was taken by Crassus, as the lieutenant of Sulla,during the wars of the latter with the partisansof Marias. (1'lut. Crass. 6.) It received a colonyunder Augustus, and assumed the title of il ColoniaFhla Tuder," probably in consequence of some ser­vices rendered during the Peruvian War, though itsname is not mentioned by Appian. (Plin. iii. 14. s. 19;Lib. Colon, p. 214; Murat. Inner, pp. 1111.4, 1120.3; Orell. hiscr. 3726.) It appears from inscriptionsto have been a flourishing and important town underthe Roman Empire, and is mentioned by all the geo­graphers among the chief towns of Umbria. (Strab.v. p. 227; Plin. I.e.; Ptol. iii. 1. § 54.) It wasnot situated on the Flaminian Way, but the Tabulagives a line of road, which led from Amelia toTuder, and thence to Perusia. (Tab. Pent.) Itsgreat strength as a fortress, arising from its elevatedposition, is already alluded to by Strabo ((, c ). andrendered it a place ot' importance during the GothicWars, after the fall of the Western Empire. (Procop.j5. G. ii. 10, 13.) It is again mentioned as a cityunder the Lombards (P. Oiac. iv. 8); and there canbe no doubt that it continued throughout the middleages to be a considerable city. It is now much de­cayed, and has only about 2500 inhabitants, butstill retains the title of a city. Considerable ancient remains still attest it.s formerconsideration. Among these the most remarkableare the walls of the city, some portions of which areapparently of great antiquity, resembling those ofPerusia, Volaterrae, and other Etruscan cities, butthey are in general more regular and less rude.Other parts of the walls, of which three distinct cir­cuits may be traced, are of regular masonry andbuilt of travertine. These are certainly of Romandate. '1 here are also the remains of an ancientbuilding, called by local antiquarians the temple ofMars, but more probably a basilica of Roman date.Numerous coins and other small objects have beenibund at Todi; among the latter the most interestingis a bronze statue of Mars, now in the Museo Grc-gyriano at Rome. The coins uf Tuder, which are numerous, belong to th© class called A* fa*being of brass and of large rw*m;i?: aearliest coinage of Volaterrae.

In this city the womenare said to have feasted Tereus with the body of his son $and the polluted tables of mankind originated from hence.But the hoopoop, into which they fay Tereus was changed,is a'bird not larger than a quail, and has wings on itshead which resemble crests. It is a wonderful circum­stance that, in this country, swallows neither breed, norlay eggs, nor build their nests on the roofs of houses.The Phocenses fay, that when Philomela was changedinto a bird, she flew from the country of Tereus throughfear of him. But the Daulienscs have a temple of Minerva,in which there is an ancient statue of the goddess. Itlikewise contains a more ancient wooden statue, whichthey fay Procne brought from Athens. A place calledThronius forms a part of the Daulian land: and- in thisplace there is an heroic monument, dedicated to that herofrom whom the people here derived their origin. Somefay, that this hero was Xanthippus, a man of no obscurereputation in warlike affairs: but others are of opinion,that he was Phocus the son of Ornytion, and the grand­son of Sisyphus. This hero they venerate every day; andafter they have slain the victims which they sacrifice tohim, they pour the blood through a hole into the se-,pulchre, and consume the entrails in the fame place.There is an eminence in Daulis, by which you mayascend to the summits of mount Parnassus. This road islonger, but not so difficult as that at Delphos, whichleads to the fame summits. CHAP.

With these explanations, the editor takes leave of a work,on which he has bestowed much time and toil, and which, hewould fain hope, may contribute in some humble measure tothe better understanding and appreciation by his youthfulcountrymen of an author, a language and a people, formedby nature beyond most, if not beyond all others, to be sever­ally the writer, the vehicle and the subject of history.

IN this Kevised Edition, the text and the notes have beencarefully collated with those of Ritter in his new edition (Bonnand Cambridge, 1848), and such corrections and additions, aswere deemed just and important, have been adopted from thissource. I cannot, however, by any means, accept the manygratuitous emendations and dogmatic assertions which disfig­ure and depreciate this otherwise excellent commentary. Othercorrections and improvements have also been made, whichhave been suggested by use of the book in classes, or to whichmy attention has been called, whether by private correspond­ence, or by notices and reviews in the public journals. I havebeen especially indebted to the critical acumen and accuratescholarship of my friend, Mr. Charles Short, of Roxbury, wri­ting in the Bibliotheca Sacra, for not a few valuable sugges«tions and amendments.

THU'Itll (Bovptoi: F.th. &oupifos, Thurinus),cnlled also by some Latin writers anil by PtolemyThukium (Qovpiov, Ptol.), a city of Magna Graecia,situated on the Tarentine gulf, within a short dis­tance of the site of Syharis, of which it may be con­sidered as having taken the place. It was one oftlu- latest of all the Creek colonies in this part ofItaly, not having been founded till nearly 70 yearsafter the fall of Syharis. The site of that city hadremained desolate for a period of 58 years after itsdestruction by the Crotom'ats [Sybaius]; when atlengthen B.C. 452, a number of the Sybarite exile* andtheir descendants made an attempt to establish them-sel es attain on the spot, under the guidance of someleaders of Thessalian origin ; and the new colony roseso rapidly to prosperity that it excited the jealousyof the Crotoniats, who, in consequence, expelled thenew set this a little more than 5 years after theestablishment of the colony. (Diod. xi. 90, xii. 10.)The fugitive Sybarites first appealed for support toSparta, but without success: their application tothe Athenians was more successful, and that peopledetermined to send out a fresh colony, at the sametime that they reinstated the settlers who had beenlately expelled from thence. A body of Atheniancolonists was accordingly sent out by Pericles, underthe command of Lampon and Xenocritus; but thenumber of Athenian citizens was small, the greaterpart of those who took part in the colony being col­lected from various parts of Greece. Among themwere two celebrated names,—Herodotus the historian,and the orator Lysias. both of whom appear to haveformed part of the original colony. (Diod. xii. 10;Strab. vi. p. 263; Dionys. Lys. p. 4*53; Vit. X. Oral.p. 835; lMut. Peric. 11, AVer. 5.) The new colonistsat first established themselves on the site of the de­serted Sybaris. but shortly afterwards removed (ap­parently in obedience to an oracle) to a spot at a shortdistance from thence, where there was a fountainnamed Thuria, from whence the new city derived itsname of Thurii. (Diod./.c; Strab I.e.) The foun­dation of Thurii is assigned by Diodorus to the year416 n. c.; but other authorities place it three yearslater, b. c. 443. and this seems to be tne best au­thenticated date (Clinton, F. H. vol. ii. p. 54.) Theprotection of the Athenian name probably securedthe rising colony from the assaults of the Crotoniats,at least we bear nothing of any obstacles to its pro­gress from that quarter; but it was early disturbedby dissensions between the descendants of the originalSybarite settlers and the new colonists, the formerlaying claim not only to honorary distinctions, but tothe exclusive possession of important political privi­leges. These disputes at length ended in a revolu­tion, and the Sybarites wi re finally expelled from thecity. They established themselves for a short timeupon the river Traens, but did not maintain theirfooting long, being dislodged and finally dispersedby the neighbouring barbarians. (Diod. xii. 11,22;Arist. Pol. v. 3.) The Thnrians meanwhile con­cluded a treaty of peace with Crotona, and the newcity rose rapidly to prosperity. Fresh colonistspoured in from all quarters, especially the Pelopon-nese; and though it continued to be generally re-gar led as an Athenian colony, the Athenians iu fact formed but a small element of the popda!i:c T*citizens were divided, as we learn in<n him,I into ten tribes, the names of wu:ci n&o:? e-i dicate their origin.

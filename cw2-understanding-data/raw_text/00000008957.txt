Their country was the old province ofRomnjve, which extended from the Cvcmnes, itseastern boundary,about 90 miles in a western direc­tion. The chief town was Rhode*. The moderndepartment of Aveyron comprehends a large part ofthe Rottergue, There were silver mines in thecountry of the Ruteni and their neighbours the(labali [Gauaij], and the flax of this country wasgood. The Arverni and Ruteni were defeated by Q.Fab ins Maximus, n. c. 121, but their country wasnot reduced to the form of a Roman province (Caes.Ii. G, i. 4;"i). In Caesar's time part of the Ruteniwere included in the Provincia under the name ofRuteni Provinciates (B. G. vii, 5, 7). Vercingetoruiin B.C. 52 sent Luclerius of the Cadurci into thecountry of the Ruteni to bring them over to theGallic confederation, which he did. Caesar, in orderto protect the Provincia <>n this side, placed tnxips inthe country of the Ruteni Provinciates, and amongthe Volcae Arecomici and Tolosatea. Pliny, whoenumerates the Rateni among the people of Aqui-tania, alto mentions Ruteni in the Narbonensis(iii. 4). but he means tlie town Segodunum [Sego-ih'Ncm]. The Ruteni Provinciates of course werenearer to tlie Tee tosa ires than the other liuteni, andwe may perhaps place them in that part of tliedepartments of Aveyron and Turn which is southof theTarnis (Turn). It may be conjectured thatpart of the liuteni were added to the Provincia,eitherafter the defeat of the Ruteni by Maxunus, or afterthe conquest of Tolosa by Caepio (b.c. 106.) [G.L.] RUTICLEI.

From the mention of the Tiber justafter, some writers have supposed that he mostmean another river of the name; but there is noreason to expect such strict geographical order froma poet, and tin- mention of the Marra a few lineslower down sufficiently shows that none such wasintended. Vibins Sequester (p. 17) who makes theRutuba fall into the Tiber, has obviously misunder­stood the passage of Luvan. [E. II. It.] RUTUBIS (IVIyb. ap. riin.v. 1; 'Pewito, Ptol.

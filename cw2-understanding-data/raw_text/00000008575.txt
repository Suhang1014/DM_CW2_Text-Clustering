There can be noquestion, however, that Aradus belonged to Phoe­nicia, So, too, at the southern extremity, the townof Dora was unquestionably Phoenician, whilstCuesarea, the first town S. of the Chorseus, be­longed to Palestine. Phoenicia, as thus defined, lies between lat. 32°38' and 34° 52' N., and long. 35—36° E. It formsa narrow slip of land about 120 miles in length,and seldom more, but frequently less, than 12 milesbroad. The range of Libanus, which skirts thegreater part ot" its eastern side, throws out spurswhich form promontories on the coast, the mostremarkable of which are Theu-prueopon (&c<jv-Ttpoooiifov} between the towns of Trieris and Botrys,and the Promontorium Album between Tyre andFcdippa. Further to the S. Mount Carmel formsanother bold promontory. The whole of Phoeniciapresents a succession of hills and valleys, and istraversed by numerous small rivers which descendfrom the mountains and render it well watered andfruitful. The coast-line trends in a south-westerlydirection; so that whilst its northern extremity liesnearly under long. 36°, its southern one is aboutunder 35°. Aradus, its most northerly town, lieson an island of the same name, between 2 and 3in les from the mainland, and nearly opposite to thesouthern extremity of Mount ISargvlus, On thecoast over against it lay An 1 aradus. From thisjjoint t<* Tripolis the coast forms an extensive bay,into which several rivers fall, the principal being theEleutherus (Nakr-el-Kcbtr), which Hows throughthe valley between Mount Bargylus and Libanus,To the N, of the Eleutherus lie the towns of Si my raand Marathus; to the S. the principal town beforearriving at Tripolis was Orthosia, close to the sea­shore. Tripolis stands on a promontory about halfa mile broad, and running a mile into the sea. Itis washed by a little river now called El-Kadtsha,"the holy." Tripolis derived its name from beingthe federal town of the three leading Phoeniciancities. Tyre, Sidon, and Aradus, each of which hailhen: its separate quarter. To the S. of Tripolis thecountry ii>es into chalk hills, which press so closelytin the sea as to leave no room for cultivation, amiscarcely even for a road, and which form the boldpromontory already mentioned of Theupro.vnpon.(Rtij-(,i-$fitknh.) The chief towns of this districtare Calamos and Trieris. To the S. of Theu-prosopon the hills recede a little from the sea, butat a distance of between 20 and 30 miles formanother lofty promontory called Climax (Jias WnltaSillan), from the circumstance that the steepnessof the cliH's rendered it necessary to cut stejw inthem. Along this tract several rivers descend intothe sea, the principal of which is the Adonis (A'aAr-tt-Ibrahim). The chief towns are Botrys, 7 milesS. of l heuprosopon, and Byblus, a little S. of theAdonis. Palai-byblus lay still further S., but its site].-, unknown. Aphaca, noted for its licentious wor­ship of Venus, was seated in the interior, at thesource of the river Adonis in Lihanus. The pro­montory of Climax formed the N. point of the bay,now called Kcsruan, the S. extremity of which, ata distance of about 12 miles, is formed by the head­land lias-en-Nahr-el-Kelb, on which the town ofBerytus formerly stood. At about the middle ofthis bay the river Lycus (Xiihr-el-Kelb) din bargesitself into the sea through a narrow chasm the nearly perpendicular cliffs of which tr* J00 in? Iheight.

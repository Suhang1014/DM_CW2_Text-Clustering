L.] URBANA COLONIA, mentioned by Pliny ouly(xiv. 6. s. 8), was a colony founded by Sulla in apart of the territory of Capua, adjoining the Faler-nus ager. From its name it would appear probablethat it was a colony of citizens from Borne itself, whowere settled by the dictator in tins fertile di.strict.It is doubtful whether there ever was a town of thename, as no ullusion is found to it as such, and thedistrict itself was reunited to that of Capua beforethe time of Pliny.

D.J URB1GENUS PAUL'S. [Helveth, Vol. I.p. 1041.1 URBINUM (Ovp€?vov), was the name of twocities or municipal towns of Umbria, situated withina short distance of each other, which were distin­guished by the epithets Jlortensc and Metaurense.(Plin. iii. 14. s. 19.) 1. Uhbinum Hoktense (Urbino), Apparentlythe more considerable of the two, and for that reasonfrequently called simply Urbinum, was situated on aliill between the valleys of the Metaurus and thePisaurus (FoyUa), rattier more than 20 miles fromthe Adriatic. It is mentioned by Pliny among themunicipal towns of Umbria, and is incidentally no­ticed by Tacitus as the place where Fabius Valens,the general of Vitellius, was put to death, in a.d.09, after he had fallen into the hands of the generalsof Vespasian. (Tac Hist. iii. 62.) Its municipalrank is confirmed by numerous inscriptions, whichprove it to have been a town of some importance.(Orell. Inscr. 3714; Gruter, Jitscr. p. 387. 8, p. 392.1, &c) Procopius also notices it during the GothicWare, and correctly describes it as situated on asteep and lofty hill; it was at that time a strongfortress, but was besieged and taken by lielisarius iua.d. 538. (Procop. B. G. ii. 19.) From this timeit seems to have continued to be a place of consider­ation, and in the middle ages became the seat of go­vernment of a race of independent dukes. It is stilla considerable city, and one of the capitals of thedelegation of Urbino and Pesaro, but has no remainsof antiquity, except the inscriptions almve noticed. 2. UnniNUM Metaurense (Urbania), was si­tuated, as its name imports, in the valley of theMetaurus. on the right bank of the river, about 6miles below S. Angela in Vado (Tifernum Metau­rense), and 9 from Urbino. Its municipal rank isattested bv an inscription, in which the inhabitantsare termed" Urvinates Mataurenses, as well as by Pliny(Gruter, Inscr. p. 463. 4; Plin. iii. 14. s. 19); butit seems never to have been a place of much import­ance. In the middle ages it fell into complete decay,and was replaced by a village called Castel Durante,which, in 1625, was enlarged and raised to the dig­nity of a city by Urban VIII., from whom it derivesits present name of Vrbania. (Cluver. Hal. p. 620;Rampoldi, Diz. Top. vol. iii. p. 127S.) [E. H. B.] URBS SALVIA (Ofy§a 2o\ouia, Ptol. iii. 1. §52: Eth. Urbis Salviensis or Urbisalviensis: Urbisag-Ha), a town of Picenum, mentioned by Pliny amongthe municipal towns of that district. (Plin. iii. 13. s. 18.) It was situated on a hill t~en>of the Flusor (Churnti), about 2 miles {no ;»right bank of that river, and 7 miles E. of lirai-num.

No mention of either nan* exesin any writer before the fall of the Eiistao Ejuwre.but it is probable that the Urbiventum (Oi^Mrrw)of Procopius, which figures in the Gothic Wan«ifortress of some importance, is the same \sba »the Urbs Vetus of P.

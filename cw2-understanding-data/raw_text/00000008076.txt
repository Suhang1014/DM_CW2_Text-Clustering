The surface of the island is mountainous. Theprincipal mountains wereOrdymnus in the W„Olym­pus in the S., and Lepethymnus in the N. Their ele­vations, as marked in the English Admiralty Charts,are respectively, 1780, 3080, and 2750 feet. Theexcellent climate and fine air of Lesbos are celebratedby [>ii)dorus Siculus (v. 82). and it is still reputedtu be the most healthy island in the Archipelago.(Purdy's Sailing Directory, p. 154.) Tacitus (Ann.ri. 3) calls it "insula nobilis et amoena." Agateswere found there (Plin. xxxvii. 54), and its quarriesproduced variegated marble (xxxvi. 5). The whole­some Lesbian wines (" innocentis pocula Lesbii,"Hut. Carm. i. 17, 21) were famous in the ancientworld; but of this a more particular account ispren under McriiYftCVA. The trade of the islandvii active and considerable; but here again wemast refer to what is said concerning its chief cityMvtilese. At the present day the figs of Lesbosare celebrated; but its chief exports are oil and(Tall-nuts. The population was estimated, in 1816,at 25,000 Greeks and 5000 Turks. Tradition says that the first inhabitants of Lesboswere Pelasgians: and Xanthus was their legendaryleader. Next came Ionians and others, under Ma-careus, who is said by Diodorus (v. 80) to haveintroduced written laws two generations before theTniian war. Last were the Aeolian settlers, underthe leadership of Lesbus, who appears in Strabounder the name Grails, and who is said to havemarried Methymna, the daughter of Macareus.Mrtilene was the elder daughter. This is certain,thai the early history of Lesbos is identical withthat of the Aeolians. Strabo regards it as theircentral seat (ax'°°y /xirrpoVoAir, xiii. pp. 616,Hi). In mercantile enterprise, in resistance to thePersians, and in intellectual eminence, the insularAs.lians teem to have been favourably contrastedwith their brethren on the continent. That whichHorace calls "Aeolium carmen" and "AeoliaeMejr (Carm. ii. 13. 24, iii. 30. 13) was due tothe senilis of Lesbos: and Niebuhr's expressionresrarding this island is, that it was "the pearl ofthe Aeolian race." (Lectures on Ancient FAknologyt*f Geography, vol. i. p. 218.) Lei-bos was not, like several other islands of theArchipelago, such as Cos, Chios and Samos, theterritory of one city. We read of six Aeolian citiesin Letbos, each of which had originally separatep^sesfiotjs and an independent government, andwhich were situated in the following geographicalorder. Methyxsa (now Molivo) was on the north,almost immediately opposite Assos, from which itwas separated by one of the previously mentionedtfraits. Somewhere in its neighbourhood wasArisba, which, however, was incorporated in theMrtbrmnaean territory before the time of Herodotus(i. 151). Near the western extremity of the islandwere A.vnssA and Erkssi'S. The former was alittle to the north of Cape Sigrium, and was situatedw a snail island, which in Pliny's time (ii. 91) wascrniiected with Lesbos itself. The latter was on thetroth of the promontory, and is still known undertb! name of Erissi, a modern village, near whichnuai hate been fonnd. At the head of Port Caloni w» Pyemia, which in Strabo's time had been swal- Ijwed op by the sea, with the exception of a suburb. (Strab. xiii. p. 618; see Plin. v. 31.) The name ofPera is still attached to this district according toI'ococke. On the eastern shore, facing the main­land, was Mytilene. Besides these places, wemust mention the following: — Hiera, doubtless atthe head of Port Olivier, said by Pliny to have beendestroyed before his day; Agamede, a village inthe neighbourhood of Pyrrha; Nape, in the plain ofMethymna; Aegiris, between Methymna andMytilene; and Polium, a site mentioned by Ste-phanus B. Most of these places are noticed moreparticularly under their respective names. All ofthem decayed, and became unimportant, in compa­rison with Methymna and Mytilene, which were si­tuated on good harbours opjtosite the mainland, andconvenient for the coasting-trade. The annals ofLesbos are so entirely made up of events affectingthose two cities, especially the latter, that we mustrefer to them for what does not bear upon the generalhistory of the island. From the manner in which Lesbos is mentionedboth in the Iliad and Odyssey (//. xxiv. 544, Od. iv.342), it is evident that its cities were populous andflourishing at a very early period. They had alsovery large possessions on the opposite const. Lesboswas not included in the conquests of Croesus.(Herod, i. 27.) The severe defeat of the Lesbiansby the Salmans under Polycrates (iii. 39) 6eemsonly to have been a temporary disaster. It is saidby Herodotus (i. 151) that at first they had nothingto fear, when Cyrus conquered the territories ofCroesus on the mainland: but afterwards, with otherislanders, they seem to have submitted voluntarilyto Harpagus(i. 169). The situation of this island onthe very confines of the great struggle between thePersians and the Greeks was so critical, that itsfortunes were seriously affected in every phase ofthe long conflict, from this period down to the peaceof Antalcidas and the campaigns of Alexander. The Lesbians joined the revolt of Aristagoras(Herod, vi. 5, 8), and one of the most memorableincidents in this part of its history is the consequenthunting down of its inhabitants, as well as those ofChios and Tenedos, by the Persians (Herod, vi. 31;Aesch. Pers. 881). Aftor the battles of Salamis andMycale they boldly identified themselves with theGreek cause. At first they attached themselves tothe Lacedaemonian interest: but before long theycame under the overpowering influence of the navalsupremacy of Athens. In the early part of thePeloponneBian War, the position of Lesbos was morefavourable than that of the other islands: for, likeCorcyra and Chios, it was not required to furnish amoney-tribute, but only a naval contingent (Thuc.ii. 9). But in the course of the war, Mytilene wasinduced to intrigue with the Lacedaemonians, and totake the lead in a great revolt from Athens. Theevents which fill so large a portion of the third bookof Thucydides — the speech of Cleon, the changeof mind on the part of the Athenians, and thenarrow escape of the Lesbians from entire massacreby the sending of a second ship to overtake the first —are perhaps the most memorable circumstances con­nected with the history of this island. The lands ofLesbos were divided among Athenian citizens (icAn-poDyoi), many of whom, however, according toBoeckh, returned to Athens, the rest remaining as agarrison. Methymna had taken no part in the revolt,and was exempted from the punishment After theSicilian expedition, the Lesbians again wavered intheir allegiance to Athens; but the result was unim­ M 3

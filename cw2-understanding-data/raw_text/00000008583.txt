Tbecity was at that time still under the government ofAndromachus, whose mild and equitable administra­tion is said to have presented a strong contrast withthat of the despots and tyrants of the other Siciliancities. lie welcomed Timoleon with open arms, andafforded him a secure resting place until he wasenabled to carry out his plans in other parts of Sicily.(Diod. I. c.; Plut. /. c.) It is certain that Andro­inachus was not deprived of the chief power, when:ill the other tyrants were expelled by Timoleon, butwas permitted to retain it undisturbed till bis death.(Marcellin. Vit. Thucyd.§ 27.) We hear, however,very lit tie of Tauroineniuin for some time after this.It is probable that it passed under the authority ofAgathocles, who drove the historian Timaeus intoexile; and some time after this it was subject to adomestic despot of the name of Tjndarion, who wascontemporary with Hicetas of Syracuse and Fhintiasof Agrigentum. (Diod. xxii. Exc. 11. p. 495.) Tyn-darion was one of those who concurred in invitingPyrrhus into Sicily (n.c. 278), and wbeu thatmonarch landed with bis army at Tauromenimu,joined him with all his forces, and supported him inhis march upon Syracuse. (Diod. c. pp. 495, 49G.)A few years later we find that Tauroineniuin hadfallen into tbe power of Hieron of Syracuse, and wasemployed by him as a stronghold in the war againstthe Maniert'mcs. {Ib. p. 497.) It was also one ofthe cities which was left under his dominion by thetreaty concluded with him by the Romans in B.C.203. (Diod. xxiii. p. 502.) This is doubtless thereason that its name is not again mentioned duringthe First Punic War. There is no doubt that Tauromeiiium continuedto form a part of the kingdom of Syracuse till thedeath of Hieron, and that it only passed under thegovernment of Home when the whule. island of Sicilywas reduced to a Roman province; but we havescarcely any account of the part it took during theSecond Punic W ar, though it would appear, from ahint in Appian {Sic. 5), that itsubniitted to Marcel-lus on favourable terms; and it is probable that itwas on that occasion it obtained the peculiarlyfavoured position it enjoyed under tbe Roman domi­nion. For we learn from Cicero that Tauromeninmwas one of the three cities in Sicily which enjoyedthe privileges of a ''eivilas foederata" or allied city,thus retaining a nominal independence, and was noteven subject, like Messana, to the obligation of fur­nishing ships of war when called upon. (Cic. Ycrr.ii. 00, iii. 0, v. 19.) Iiut the city suffered severecalamities during the Servile War in Sicily, b.c.134—132. having fallen into the hands of the in­surgent slaves, who, on account of the great strengthof its position, made it one of their chief posts, andwere able for a long time to defy the arms of theconsul Kupilius. They held out until they werereduced to the most fearful extremities by famine,when the citadel was at length betrayed into thehands of the consul by one of their leaders namedSarapion, and the whole of the survivors put to thesword. (Diod. xxxiv. Exc. Phot, p. 528; Oros. v. 9.)Tauromeninm again bore a conspicuous part duringthe wars of Sextus Tompeius in Sicily, and, from itsstrength as a fortress, was one of the principal pointsof the position which he took up in B.C. 36, for de­fence against Ootavian. It became the scene also ofa sea-tight between a part of the fleet of Octavian, commanded by the tiiamvir in person txiPompeias, which terminated in the defeat a. i tk ■:total destruction of the former. (Af-iur.fi.'. t.103, 105, 106 — 111, 116; Dion xh.

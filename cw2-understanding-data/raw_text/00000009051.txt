G8); a stone which burnt in water(Id. xxxiii. 30); and nitre, which was found nearPhilippi (Id. xxxi. 46). In addition to the.se, M.Viquesnel mentions fine marble, which is quarriedfrom the mountains of Lidja (p. 200); excellentiron, manufactured at Samakor (p. 209); alum,produced at Chaphane (p. 213) ; and potter's clay,in the district of Rhodope, used by the Turks in thefabrication of earthenware- (p. 319). He states alsothat Rhodope abounds in mineral waters (ii.)j andthat there are warm springs at Lidja (p. 212). A few miscellaneous notes will conclude this partof our subject. The narrow portion of Thrace between the Kuxine,Bosporus and Propontis, is sometimes called theDelta (to Ac'Ato, Xen. Anab. vii. 1. § 33, 5. § 1). Reference is several times made to violent naturalconvulsions, which destroyed various Tliracian cities.Thus Strabo (i. 59) says that it appeared that somecities were swallowed up by a flood in Lake Bisto-nis; and he (vii. p. 319), Pliny (iv. 18), and Mela(ii. 2) speak of the destruction of Bizone, on theKuxine, by earthquakes. Livy (xl. 22) describes the region between Mae-rliea and the llaeums as without inhabitants (solitu-dines). Herodotus (vii. 109) speaks of a lake near Pi>ty-rus (on the coast N. of Abdera), about 30 stadia incircumference, abounding in fish, and extremely salt. Thrace possessed two highroads, 11 both startingfrom Byzantium ; the one (called the King's road,from having been in [tart the march of Xerxes in hisinvasion of Greece, Liv. xxxix. 27; Herod, vii. 115),crossing the Hebrus and the Nestus, touching thenorthern coast of the Aegean sea at Neapolis, a littlesouth of Philippi, then crowing the Strymon at Am-phipolis, and stretching through Pella across InnerMacedonia and Illyria to Dyrrhachium. The otherroad took a more northerly course, passing along theupper valley of the Hebrus from Adrianople to Phi-lippopolis, then through Sardica {Sophia) and Nais-sus (jVmcA), to the Danube near Belgrade, being thehighroad now followed from Constantinople to Bel­grade." (Grote, vol. xii. p. 34, note.) Herodotus(V. c.) remarks, with evidetttsurpri.se, that the King'sroad had not, up to his time, been destroyed by theThracians, a circumstance which he seems to attri­bute to the almost religious respect with which theyregarded the " great king." It may be safely in­ferred that people who were considered to have donesomething wonderful in abstaining from breaking upa road, were not great makers or maintainers of high­ways ; and it is clear from Livy's account of themarch of Manlius (xxxviii. 40, 41) along this veryroad (afterwards called by the Romans, Via Egna-tia, q. i\), that, although it was the principal line ofcommunication between Euroj* and A.-da, it was atthat time (b. c. 18S) in a very bad condition.Prom this some conception may be formed of thedeplorable state in which the roads of the interiorand mountainous districts must have been, and inwhich, indeed, they i>ti) 1 remain. (Viquesnel, p. 312.)The Thracians no doubt were well aware that theirindependence would soon be lost, if there were aneasy access for disciplined armies to every part oftheir country. lSucIi paths as they possessed weresutlicieni for their own purposes of depredation, ofambush, and, when overpowered, of thght.

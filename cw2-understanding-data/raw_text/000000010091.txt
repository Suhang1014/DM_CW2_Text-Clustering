Apollo, by an oracle, made a grant of this land to Alcmaeonthe son of Amphiaraus, when a vagabond, after the murderof his mother, telling him, that " he never should be freed" from the terrors that haunted him, till he found a place for" his residence, which at the time he slew his mother had" never been seen by the sun, and then was not land ;" be足cause every other part of the earth was polluted by the par足ricide. After great perplexities, he at length, as it is said,discovered these rising heaps of sand at the mouth of theAchelous, and thought enough cast up to suffice for his sup足port, after the long course of wandering about to which hehad been necessitated ever since he murdered his mother.Fixing therefore his residence in the parts about the Oeniadae,he grew powerful, and left to the whole country the name ofAcarnania from his son Acarnas. This account of Alcmaeonwe have given exactly as we have received it from tradition. The Athenians and Phormio weighing from Acarnania,and touching again at Naupactus, very early in the springreturned to Athens. Thither they brought all the freemenwhom they had made prisoners in the late naval engage足ments (these were afterwards exchanged man for man) andthe ships taken from the enemy. And thus the winter ended, and with it the third year ofthe war, the history of which hath been compiled by Thucy-dides. Vol. 1 2 R

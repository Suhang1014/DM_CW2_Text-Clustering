ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. fleeing away from him; that he was disturbed,and fell on his face, and on his two hands,and that a certain person touched him, andat the same time bid him to rise, and seewhat would befall his countrymen after manygenerations. He also related, that when hestood up, he was shewn a great ram withmany horns growing out of his head; and thatthe last was nigher than the rest; that afterthis he looked to the west, and saw a he-goatcarried through the air from that quarter;that he rushed upon the ram with violence,and smote him twice with his horns, andoverthrew him to the ground, and trampledupon him; that afterward he saw a very treat horn growing out of the forehead of thee-goat; and that when it was broken offjfour horns grew up that were exposed toeach of the four winds; and he wrote thatout of them arose another lesser horn, which,as he said, waxed great; and that God shewedto him, that it should fight against his nation,and take their city by force, and bring thetemple worship to confusion, and forbid thesacrifices to be offered, for one thousand twohundred and ninety-six days.* Daniel wrotethat he saw these visions in the plain of Susa,and he hath informed us that God interpretedthe appearance of this vision after the fol­lowing manner:—He said, that the ram sig­nified the kingdom of the Medes and Persians,and the horns those kings that were to reignin them; and that the last horn signified thelast king; and that he should exceed all thekings in riches and glory; that the he-goatsignified that one should come and reignfrom the Greeks, who should twice fight withthe Persians, and overcome him in battle,and should receive his entire dominion; thatby the great horn, which sprang out of theforehead of the he-goat was meant the firstking; and that the springing up of four hornsupon its falling off} and the conversion ofevery one of them to the four quarters of theearth, signified the succours that should ariseafter the death of the first king; and the par­tition of the kingdom among them; and that * See Daniel viii. 1—14. they should be neither his children, nor ofhis kindred that should reign over the habit­able earth for many years; and that fromamong them there should arise a certain kingthat should overcome our nation and laws,and should take away the political govern­ment, and should spoil the temple, and forbidthe sacrifices to be offered, for three years.Accordingly it happened that our nationsuffered these things under Antiochus Epi-phanes, according to Daniel's vision; andwhat he wrote many years before they cameto pass. In the same manner Daniel wroteconcerning the Roman government, and thatour country should be made desolate by them.All these things did this man leave in writing,as God had shewed them to him. Insomuchthat such as read his prophecies, and seehow they have been fulfilled, may justlywonder at the honour wherewith God ho­noured Daniel; and may thence discoverhow the Epicureans are in an error, who castProvidence out of human life; and do notbelieve that God takes care of the affairs ofthe world; nor that the universe is governedand continued in being by that blessed andimmortal nature; but say that the world iscarried along of its own accord, without aruler and a curator, which, were it destituteof a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, itwould be like ships without pilots, which wesee destroyed by the winds; or like chariotswithout drivers, which are overturned: sowould the world be dashed to pieces by beingcarried without a Providence, and so perishand come to nought. So that by the afore­mentioned predictions of Daniel those menseem to err from the truth, who determinethat God exercises no Providence over humanaffairs. For if that were the case, that theworld went on by mechanical necessity, weshould not see that all things would come topass according to his prophecy. Now as tomyself I have so described these matters as Ihave found them and read them: but if anyone be inclined to another opinion aboutthem, let him enjoy his sentiments withoutany blame from me.

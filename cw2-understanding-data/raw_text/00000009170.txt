D.] OBRIMAS, a river of Phrygia, an eastern tribu­tary of the Maeander, had its sources, according toLivy (xxxviii. 15), on the eastern side of MountCadmus, near the town of Ahporidos, and flowed inthe neighbourhood of Apamea Cibotus (Plin. t. 29.)This is all the direct information we possess aboutit; but from Livy's account of the expedition ofManlius, who had pitched his camp there, when hewas visited by Seleucus from Apamea, we may gathersome further particulars, which enable us to identifythe Obriinas with the Sandukli Chai, Manlius hadmarched direct from Sagalassus, and must have ledbis army through the plains of Dombai, \ assing iuthe rear of Apamea. Thus Seleucus would easilyhear of the consul being in his neighbourhood, and,in his desire to propitiate him, would have startedafter him and overtaken him the next day (posterodie.) Manlius, moreover, at the sources of theObrimas required guides, because he found himselfhemmed in by mountains and unable to find his wayto the plain of Metropolis. All this agrees perfectlywell with the supposition that the ancient Obriinasis the modern Sandukli Chai (Hamilton. Researches,ii. p. 172, &c.). Franz (Funf Inschriften, p. 37),on the other hand, supposes the Kodsha Chai tocorrespond with the Obrimas. Arundel) {Itiscov. inAsia Atin. i. p. 231), again, believes that Livy hasconfounded the sources of the Marsyas and Maeanderwith those of the Obriinas. [L. S.J OBRINGA ('Ofy.7j.af).

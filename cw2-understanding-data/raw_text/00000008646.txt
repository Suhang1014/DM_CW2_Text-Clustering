D.] NAPETl'NUS SINUS (4 Nowt)tT»oi koXwos)was the name given by some writers to the gulf onthe W. coast of Brattium more commonly known asthe Terinaeus Sinus, and now called the Gulf of St.Eufemia. We have no account of the origin of thename, which is cited from Antiochus of Syracuseboth by Strabo and Dionysius. (Strab. vi. p. 255;Dionys. i. 35.) Aristotle calls the same gulf theLametine Gulf (6 AaurjTiioi k6\itos, Arist. Pol.vii. 10), from a town of the name of Lamctium orLametini; and in like manner it has been generallyassumed that there was a town of the name of Nnpc-tium, situated on its shores. But wo have no otherevideuce of this; an inscription, which has beenfrequently cited to show that there existed a town ofthe name as late as the time of Trajan, is almostcertainly spurious.

[Dacia, Vol. I. p. 744, b.]NAR (4 Hap, Strab.: A'era), a considerable riverof Central Italy, and one of the principal tributariesof the Tiber. It rises in the lofty group of theApennines known as the Monti dtlla Sibilla (theMons Fiscellus of Pliny), on the confines of Um-bria and Picenum, from whence it has a course ofabout 40 miles to its confluence with the Tiber,which it enters 5 miles above Ocriculum, alterflowing under the walls of Interamna and Narnia.(Strab. v. pp. 227, 235; Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Lucan.i. 475; Vib. Seq. p. 15.) About 5 miles above theformer city, it receives the tributary stream of theVklisus; a river as large as itself, and whichbrings down the accumulated waters of the LacusVelini, with those of the valleys that open out atReate. The Nar and Velinus together thus drain thewhole western declivity of the Central Apenninesthrough a space of above 60 miles. The Nar isremarkable fur its white and sulphureous waters,which arc alluded to by Enuius and Virgil as wellas Pliny. (Eunius, ^4nn. vii. Fr. 19; Virg. Am.vii. 517; Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.) It is singular thatthe last writer has confounded the Nar with theVelinus, and speaks of the former as draining thoLacus Velini, into which it falls near Reate. BothCicero and Tacitus, on the contrary, correctly repre­sent the waters of the lake as curried off into theNar, which is now effected by an artificial cutforming the celebrated Casrade of the lY/mo, itFalls of Tern*. This channel was first opened byM'. Curius, about u. c. 272. but there must alwayshave been some natural outlet for the waters of theYclino. (Plin. I c; Cic ad AM. iv. 15; TacAnn, i. 79.) The Nar was reckoned in ancienttimes navigable for small vessels; and Tacitusspeaks of Piso, the murderer of Gcnnanieus, asembarking at Nuniia, and descending from tluuceby the Nar and the Tiber to Rome.

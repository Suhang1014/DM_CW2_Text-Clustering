The branch which flows on the Gallichank is broader and less rapid: this is the Vahalis{Waal), which Hows into the Mosa. (Hist v. 23.)[BATAVom'M I.Nsri.A.] He knows only two out­lets of the Rhine, and one of them is through tlieMosa. The Rhine, as he calls the eastern branch,is the boundary between Gallia and Germania. Eastof this eastern branch he places the Frtsii (/Inn.iv. 72); and herein he agrees with Pliny, whoplaces them between the Middle Hhine and theKlevum. Accordingly the Khenus of Tacitus isthe Khenus of Mela and Pliny. This third branch ot the Rhine seems to he that■which Tacitus calls the work of Drusus (Ann. ii.ti), and which Seutonius (Claudius, c. 1) mentionswithout saying where it was: '"Drusus trans Rhenumfossas novi et immensi operis ef fecit, quae nunc adhucDrusinae vocantur." Gcnnanicus in his expeditionagainsl the northern Germans (Tac. Ann, ii. 6), or­dered his fleet to assemble at the Batavorum Insula,whence it sailed through the Fossa Drusiana, andthe lakes into the Ocean and to the river Ami.-ia(£"//«). This course was probably taken to avoidthe navigation alone; the sea-coast of Holland. Ona former occasion Gcnnanicus had taken the samecourse (Ann. i. 60), and his father Drusus haddone the ?-ame. Ptolemy (ii. 0. § 4), who wrote after Tacitus andPliny, is acquainted with three outlets of the Rhine,lie places first the outlet of the Mosa in 24° 40'long., 53° 20' lat. He then comes to the Bataviand to Lngdunum, which town he places in 2t»° 30'long., 53° 20' lat. The western mouth of the Rhineis in 2tiJ 4.'/ Ion?.. 5.'»° 20' lat. The mid.He mouthis in 27° long.,53°30' lat.; and the eastern in 28°long., 54° lat. His absolute numbers are incorrect,and they may be relatively incorrect also. Hiswestern outlet is a little ea-t of Lugdunum, andthis should he the Old Rhine or Rhine Proi>er.The middle month i^ further east, and the easternmi.mil further east still. The eastern mouth maybe the }>>■•/ but it is difficult to say what Ptolemy'smiddle mouth is. Gospel in supines that Ptolemy'swestern mouth may have been about Zawiwoord.II'- further supposes that the Middle Mouth ac-cording to Ins measures was about the latitude oflinkkum, about 4 leagues above Zandwoord, andhe adds that this mouth was not known to thosewriters who preceded Ptolemy, and we may con­jecture that it was little used, and was the firstof the cutlets that ceased to be navigable. '1 hethird mouth he supposes to correspond to the, pa:*-sage of the Vlie. But nothing can be more vagueand unsatisfactory than this explanation, foundedon Ptolemy's measurements and pure conjecture.Si much as this is plain. Ptolemy does not reckonthe Mosa as one of the outlets of the Rhine, as theRoman writers do; and he makes three outlets be­sides the outlet of the Mosa. This country of swamps,rivers, and forests throughwhich the Lower Rhine flowed has certainly under­gone great changes since the Roman period, owingto the Moods of the Rhine and the inundations ofthe sea. and it is very difficult, perhaps impossible,to tnako the ancient descriptions agree with themodem localities. Still it was a fixed opinion thatthe Rhine divided into two great brandies, as Caesarsays, and this was the division of the Rhine from the Waal at Panwrdrn.. or wlifTfrer it trxrbeen in former times. One of the creat rct*ithat w hich we call the Moot that fl.m b*Jidam: the other was the Rhine Proper tin*. e:.iasea near Leidm, and it was the strwri mmnrrrten to Ltidtn that formed the boan-iw" kGallia and Germania. (Servian, ad ,4'vid727.) Ptolemy places all his three net A- alia, and it is the eastern mouth «hi;h bt Ithe boundary between Roman Gall'u uiiG~almania (ii. 11. § 1). If his eastern a#si»«'-/, he makes this river from Anim \outlet of the Yssel the eastern limit <i IGallia in his time. This may be so, bit inot so that Pliny and Tacitus understood todarj. Whatever chances may lave tjksin the Delta of the Rhine, D'AbvuVs '*is just, when he says tlut we can «f"«ancient condition of the places suficw^ *•it agree with the statements of the arxyr: i The floods of the Rhine have been k?3 Ilimits by embankments of earth hWeseL, in tlie Prussian province of ftwAextend along the Rhine and its bnnebofclThe Romans began these works.

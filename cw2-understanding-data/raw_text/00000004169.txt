As to that great critic, Photius, in the ninth century,who is supposed not to have had this testimony in his copyof Josephus, or else to have esteemed it spurious, because inhis extracts out of Josephus's Antiquities it is not expresslymentioned; this is a strange thing indeed! that a sectionwhich had been cited out of Josephus's copies all alongbefore the days of Photius, as well as it has been all alongcited out of them since his days, should be supposed not tohe in his copy, because he does not directly mention it incertain short and imperfect extracts, no way particularlyrelating to such matters. Those who lay a stress on thissilence of Photius seem little to have attended to the natureand brevity of those extracts. They contain little or nothing,as he in effect professes at their entrance, but what concernsAntipater, Herod the Great, and his brethren and family,with their exploits, till the days of Agrippa^wn. and Cumanus,the governor of Judea, fifteen years after the death of ourSaviour, without one word of Pilate, or what happened underhis government, which yet was the only proper place inwhich this testimony could come to be mentioned. However,since Photius seems, therefore, as we have seen, to suspectthe treatise ascribed by some to Josephus, of the Universe,because it speaks very high things of the eternal generationand divinity of Christ, this looks very like his knowledgeand belief of somewhat really in the same Josephus, whichspake in a lower manner of him, which could be hardly anyother passage than this testimony before us.

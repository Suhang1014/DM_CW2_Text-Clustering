He adduces insupport of this hypothesis the existence of a pooddeal of broken pottery there, and of a tew caves inthe cliffs below. Volsinii appears to have been one of the mostpowerful cities of Etruria, and was doubtless one ofthe 12 which formed the Etruscan confederation, asVolsinii is designated by Livy (x. 37) and ValeriusMaxim us (ix. 1. extern. 2) as one of the '* capitaEtruriae." It is described by Juvenal (iii. 191) asseated among well-wooded hills. We do not hear of Volsinii in history till after thefall of Veil. It is possible that the success of theKoman arms may have excited the alarm and jea­lousy of the Volsinienses, as their situation mightrender them the next victims of Roman ambition.At all events, the Volsinienses, in conjunction withthe Sal pi nates, taking advantage of a famine andpestilence which had desolated Rome, made incur­sions into the Roman territory in B.C. 391. Butthey were easily beaten: 8000 of them were madeprisoners; and they were clad to purchase a twentyyours' truce on condition of restoring the bootythey had taken, and furnishing the pay of the Romanarmy for a twelvemonth. (Liv. v. 31, 3*2.) We do not again hear of Volsinii till the yearn. c. 310, when, in common with the rest of theEtruscan cities, except Arretium, they took part inthe siege of Sutrium, a city in alliance with Rome.(Liv. ix. 32.) This war was terminated by the de­feat of the Etruscans at lake Vadimo, the first fatalshock to their power. (/&. 39.) Three years after­wards we find the consul P. Deems Mus capturingseveral of the Volsinian fortresses. {Ib. 41.) In295, L. Postumius Megellus ravaged their territoryand defeated them under the walls of their own city,slaying 2800 of them; in consequence of which they,together with Perusia and Arretium, were glad topurchase a forty years' peace by the payment of aheavy fine. (Id. x. 37.) Not more than fourteenyears, however, had elapsed, when, with their alliesthe Vulcientes, they again took up arms againstR«>me. But this attempt ended apparently in theirfinal subjugation in B.C. 280. (Liv.Fp. xi.; Fast.Com.) Pliny (xxxiv. 7. s. 1G) retails an absurdstory, taken from a Greek writer called MetrodorusScepsius, that the object of the Romans in capturingVolsinii was to make themselves masters of 2000statues which it contained. The story, however,suffices to show that the Volshrians had attained toa great pitch of wealth, luxury, and art. This isconfirmed by Valerius Maxim us (/. c\), who alsoadds that this luxury was the cause of their ruin,by making them so indolent and effeminate thatthey at length suffered the management of theircommonwealth to be usurped by slaves. From thisdegrading tyranny they were rescued by the Ro­mans. (Flor. i. 21 ; Zonaras, /. c; A.Victor, Kir.llhstr. 36 ; Oros. iv. 5.) The Romans, when they took Volsinii, razed thetown, and compelled the inhabitants, as we havealready intimated, to migrate to another spot. (Zo-'tiaras, c.)

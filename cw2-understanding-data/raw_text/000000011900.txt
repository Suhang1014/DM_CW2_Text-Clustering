[Book IV. mum in weight and price was fixed; the quantity of silverplate was likewise restricted by law, and lastly general maxi­mum rates were prescribed for the expenses of ordinary and 161. festal meals; these, for example, were fixed in 593 at 10 and 81. 100 sesterces (Is. Id. and 15s. lOd.) in 673 at 30 and 300sesterces (4s. 7$d. and £2 7s.) respectively. Unfortunatelytruth requires us to add, that of all the Roman nobles notmore than three—-and these not including the legislators• themselves—are said to have complied with these imposinglaws; and in the case of these three it was the law of theStoa, and not that of the state, that curtailed the bill of fare.Silver plate. It is worth while to dwell for a moment on the luxury thatwent on increasing in defiance of these laws as respectssilver plate. In the sixth century silver plate for the tablewas, with the exception of the traditionary silver salt-dish, ararity; the Carthaginian ambassadors jested over the cir­cumstance, that at every house to which they were invitedthey had encountered the same silver plate (ii. 21).

To judge of the sums expended onthese, we must recollect that the workmanship was paid forat enormous rates; for instance, Gaius Gracchus paid forchoice articles of silver fifteen times, and Lucius Crassus, 9.5. consul in 659, eighteen times the value of the metal, and thelatter gave for a pair of cups by a noted silversmith 100,000sesterces (£1050). So it was in proportion everywhere.Marriage. How it fared with marriage and the rearing of children,is shown by the Gracchan agrarian laws, which first placeda premium thereon (P. 90). Divorce, formerly in Romealmost unheard of, was now a daily occurrence; while in theoldest Roman marriage the husband had purchased hiswife, it might have been proposed to the noble Romans ofthe present times that, with the view of bringing the nameinto accordance with the reality, they should introducemarriage for hire.. Even a man like Metellus Maeedonicus,who for his honourable domestic life and his numerous hostof children was the admiration of his contemporaries, when ^

Thereare traces of painting of the 13th century, showingthat then, if not previously, it was a Christianchurch. A little further on we come to an inscrip­tion which records the levelling of the Clivus Tibur-tinus in the time of Constantius and Constans. Themime of the latter is purposely effaced, no doubt bytlie order of Magnentius. This monument was dis­covered in 1736, and re-erected by order of the ma­gistrates uf Tibtur at the same spot w here it wasfound. The delightful country in the vicinity of Tiburcaused many villas to be erected there during thelatter period of the Republic and under the firstCaesars, as we see from the writings of Catullus,Horace, Propertius, Statius, and other pcets. Ofthese villas, however, of which we shall mention onlythe more interesting, there are but few remains, andscarcely any that can be identified with certainty.The most striking are those commonly called thevilla of Maecenas on the SW. side of the town, nearthe Cascatelle. Ligorio was the 6rst who calledthis building the ulla of Maecenas; but there is noauthority for the assumption. It was probablyfounded on a wrong conception of a passace inHorace (Otl. iii. 29. 6, seq.), which is also quotedhv Mr. Cramer (Italy, vol. ii. p. 60) under a misap­prehension that it contains an allusion to a residencepossessed by Maecenas at Tibur, instead of to hisI own-house on the Ksquiliiie. The plan of thisbuilding published by Marquez and Uggeri is correct.It was founded on gigantic suhstructions, the magni­tude of which may be best observed on the N. side,or that towards the valley of the Anio. It is animmense quadrilateral edifice, f>37j feet long, and450 broad, surrounded on three sides by sumptuousporticoes. The fourth side, or that which lookstowards Rome, which is one of the long sides, had atheatre in the middle of it, with a hall or saloon oneach side. The porticoes are arched, and adornedon the side towards the area with half columns uf thel>oric order. Behind is a series of chambers. Anoblong tumulus now marks the site ot the house, or.a.-coi'ding to Nibby, who regards it as the temple ofHercules, of the Cella. The pillars were of traver­tine, and of a beautiful Ionic order. One of themstill existed on the ruins as late as 1S12. This im­mense building intercepted the ancient road, furwhich, as appears from an inscription preserved inthe Vatican, a vault or tunnel was constructed, partot which is still extant. Hence it gave name to thePttrta Scura, or Obscura, mentioned in the Bull ofBenedict, which it continued to bear at least as lateas the 15th century. To our apprehension, the plan here laid down israther that of a palace or villa, than of a temple,nor do we perceive the resemblance, insisted on byNibby, to the temple of Fortune at Praeneste. It isnot probable that the chief fane of Hercules, thejiatron deity of 'Jil-tir. should have been erectedoutside tlie town, nor would it have been a convenientspot for Augustus to administer justice, as we havementioned that he did in his frequent retirements toTibur, in the porticoes of the temple of Hercules.Tlie precincts of the Forum would have been moreadapted to such a purpose, but if that emperor somuch frequented Tibur, evidently the favourite amongall his country retreats (Suet. I.e.), he must havehud a suitable residence for his reception. Alight not this villa have been his pa law?

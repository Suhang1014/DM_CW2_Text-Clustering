Isis and Sebapis, from which the Region derivedits name, but tlie history of tlie temple is unknown.The same remark applies to the Moneta men­tioned in this Region, which seems to have beenthe imperial mint. (Preller, Reg. p. 124.) It ismentioned in inscriptions of tlie lime of Trajan.(Marini, Attt, <jc. p. 488.) The Summum Cho-kagu m is inexplicable. The Lacus Pastokumor Pastoris was a fountain near the Colosseum,as appears from the Acta Sanctorum (in Etue-bio). The Do.mus Bkctti Phaesentis probablylay on the Esquiline.

A Porticus Clau­dia stood at the extremity of Nero's golden house,not far from the colossus of that emperor:— "Claudia dirlusas ubi porticos explicat umbrasUltima pars aulae deficient is erat." (Mart, de Spec. 2.) It is mentioned by the Anonym us Einsiedlensis andin the Mirabilia under the name of "PalatiumClaudii," between the Colosseum and S. Pietro inVincoli. The Ludcs Magncs was a gladiatorialschool apparently near the Via di S. Giovanni.(Canina, Indie, p. 108.) The Schola Ql'AEstorumet Caplatori'M or Capclatokum seems to havebeen an office for the scribes or clerks of the quaes­tors, as the Schola Xantha on the Capitoline was forthose of the curule aediles. The Capulatores werethose officers who had charge of the capides or capu-lae, that is, the bowls with handles used in sacrifices(Van*. L.L. v. § 121); but where this schola mayhave been cannot be said. The Castra Misena-tium were the city station for what we may call themarines, or soldiers attached to the fleet and navalstation at Misenmn, established by Augustus. (Tac.Ann. iv. 5: Suet. Aug. 49.) This camp appearsto have been situated near the church of S. Vito andVia MtvuJana, where also there was an aedicnla ofNeptune. (Canina, Indicaz, p. 110.) The BalneumDaphnidis, perhaps alluded to by Martial (iii. 5. 6),was probably near tlie Subura and Carinae. Lastlythe Lacus Orphki, or fountain of Orpheus, seems tohave lain near the church of S. Lucia, which borethe epithet in Or/to, or, as the Anonymous calls it,in Orthea. It is described in the lines of Martial,in which he desires Thalia to carry his book toPliny (x. 19. 4, acq.):— "I, pcrfer, brevis est labor peractaeAltum vincere tramitem Suburae.Illic Orpliea protenus videbisUdi vert ice lubricum theatri,Mirantesque feras avemque regisKaptum tjuae Phryga pertulit Tonanti.Illic parva tui domus PedonisCaelata est aquilae minore penna." From this description it would appear that thefountain was in a circular basin — for such seems tobe the meaning of" udutn theatrum/' because astatue of Orpheus playing on the lyre stwul high inthe midst of the baMn, wet and shining with spray,and surrounded by the fascinated beasts as anaudience. (Becker, Jlandb. p. 559, note.) TheMtiuitioii of the fountain near the church mentionedis very clearly indicated in these line*. As Martiallived on the bouthern extremity of the Quirinal theway frum his house to that spot would of course liethrough the Subura. At the top of the street lead­ ing through it, which, as we have seen, tmiBt bi**been the Vicus Cyprins, a short bat steep vm.brought the pedestrian to the top of the LV.d:*.where the first object that met his ej« L»fountain in question.

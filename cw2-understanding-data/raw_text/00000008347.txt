SPARTA. great magnificence, and the spoils of the Persianwars were employed in tlie erection of a beautifulstoa in the Agora, with figures of" Persians in whitemarble upon the columns, among which Pausaniasadmired the statues of Mardonius and Artemisia(hi. 11. § 3). After the Persian wars Athens be­came more and more the centre of Greek art; butSparta continued to possess, even in the time ofPausnnias, a larger number of monuments than most-'titer Grecian cities. Sparta continued unfortified during the wholeperiod of autonomous Grecian history; and it wasfirst surrounded with walls in the Macedonian pe-lind. We learn from Polybius(ix. 21) that its wallswere 48 stadia in circumference, and that it wasmuch larger than Megalopolis, which was 50 stadiain circuit Its superiority to Megalopolis in sizemust have been owing to its form, which was cir­cular. (Polyb. v. '22.) Leake remarks that, " as theside towards the Kurotas measured about two mileswith the windings of the outline, the computation ofPolybius sufficiently agrees with actual appearances,though the form of tne city seems rather to havebeen semicircular than circular." (Morca, vol. i.p. 180.) Its limits to the eastward, at the time ofthe invasion of Philip (b. c. 218), are defined byPolvbius, who j-ays (v. 22) that there was a distanceof a stadium and a half between the foot of the cliffsof Ml. Menelaium and the nearest part of the city.h\\y al-o describes the Euro!as as flowing close totin* walls (xxxiv. 28, xxxv. 29). When DemetriusPoliorcetes made an attempt upon Sparta in B. 0.296, some temporary fortifications were thrown up;and the same was done when Pyrrhus attacked thecity in B.C. 272. (Pans. i. 13. § 6, vii. 8. § 5.)lint Sparta was first regularly fortified by a walland ditch by the tyrant Nabis in b. c 195 (Liv.xxxiv. 27; Pans. vii. 8. § 5); though even thiswall did not surround the whole city, but only thelevel parts, which were more exposed to an eii'-my'sattack. (Liv. xxxiv. 38.) Livy, in his account oftheattatkof Sparta by Philopoemen in B.C. 192,alludes to two of the gates, one leading to Pharae,and the other to Mount Barbosthencs. (Liv. xxxv.30.) After the capture of the city by Philopoemen,tli.' walls were destroyed by the Achaean League(Taos. vii. 8. § 5); but they were shortly after­wards restored by order of the Unmans, when thelatter took the Spartans under their protection inoppofition to the Achaeans. (Paus. vii. 9. § 5.)Its walls and nates were still standing when Pau-;ani is visited Sparta in the second century of theChristian era, but not a trace of them now remains.When Alaric took Sparta in A, i>. 396, it was nolonger fortified, nor protected by arms or men(Zosiin. v. 6); but it continued to be inhabited in thethirteenth century, as we learn from the " Chronicleof the Morea." It was then always called Lace-daemon, and was confined to the heights around thetheatre. The walls which surrounded it at thattime may still be traced, and have been mentionedabove. It is to the medieval Lacedaeraon that theruins of the churches belong, of which no less than[-ix are noticed by the French Commission. Atterthe conquest of Peloponnesus by the Franks in thethirteenth century, William de Villehardouin built astrong fortress upon the hill of Mixithra usuallypronounced Mistrd, a little more than two mileswest of Sparta, at the foot of Mt. Taygetus. Theinhabitants of the medieval Lacedaemon soon aban­doned their town and took re fug* within the fortress of Mistrd, which long confirmed to be tie eiae yjttin the valley of the Eurotas.

XII.] TITUS WALLS UP THE CITY. 225 only part tho whole wall that was to be built among them,nor did only one legion strive with another, but the lesserdivisions of the army did the same; insomuch that each sol足dier was ambitious to please his decurion, each decurion hiscenturion, each centurion his tribune, and the ambition ofthe tribunes was to please their superior commanders; whileCaesar himself took notice of and rewarded the like conten足tion in those commanders ; for he went round about the worksmany times every day, and took a view of what was done.Titus began the wall from the camp of the Assyrians, wherehis own camp was pitched, and drew it down to the lowerparts of Cenopolis ; thence it went along the valley of Cedronto the Mount of Olives; it then bent towards the south, andencompassed the mountain as far as the rock called Periste-rion, and that other hill which lies next it, and is over thevalley which reaches to Siloam; whence it bended again tothe west, and went down to the valley of the fountain, be足yond which it went up again at the monument of Ananus thehigh-priest, and encompassing that mountain where Pompeyhad formerly pitched his camp, it returned back to tho northside of the city, and was carried on as far as a certain villagecalled the House of the Erebinthi: after which it encompassedHerod's monument, and there, on the cast, was joined toTitus's own camp, where it began. Now, the length of thiswall was forty furlongs, one only abated. Now, at this wallwithout were erected thirteen places to keep garrison in,whose circumferences put together amounted to ten furlongs ;the whole was completed in three days: so that what wouldnaturally have required some months was done in so short aninterval as is incredible. When Titus had, therefore, encom足passed the city with this wall, and put garrisons into properplaces, he went round the wall at the first watch of the night,and observed how the guard was kept; the second watch heallotted to Alexander; the commanders of legions took thethird watch. They also cast lots among themselves who shouldbe upon the watch in the night-time, and who should go allnight long round the spaces that were interposed between thegarrisons.

OCR Output ISSUS. 71 ISSUS. s i hi tasted that he cams to Issus first, where heshamefully treated the sick of the Macedonians whohad been left there. The next day lie moved fromIssus to pursue Alexander (Arrian; Curtius, iii. 8);that is, he moved towards the Pylae, and he came tothe baiika of the river Pinarus, where he halted.Is.-us was, therefore, north of the Pinarus, and somelittle distance from it, Kiepert's map of AsiaMinor marks a pass in the range of the SyrianAmanus, which is north of the pass that leads overthe same mountains from the east to Baiae (Bayai),sad nearly due east of the head of the gulf of Issus.He calls it Pylae Amanides, by which he meansthe Pylae Antanicae of Arrian, not the Amanides offctrabo; and he takes it to be the pass by whichDarius crossed the Syrian Amanus and came downupon the gulf. This may have been his route, andit would bring him to Issus at the head of the gulf,which he came to before turning south to the Pinarus(Ikli TtcJtai). It is certain that Darius crossedby some pass which brought him to Issus before hereached the Pinarus. Yet Kiepert has placed Issussouth of the Pinarus, or rather between the twobranches of this river, which he represents as unitingnear the coast. Kiepert also marks a road whichpasses over the junction of the two branches of theAmanus [Auaxus, Vol. I. p. 114] and runs toMartuh, which he supposes to be Germauicia. ThisU the dotted road marked as running north from thehead of the gulf of Issus in the plan [Vol. I. p. 115];bat even if there be such a road, it was not the roadvH Darius, which must have been the pass above men­tioned, in the latitude of the head of the gulf ofIseus; which is not marked in the above plan, butought to be. This pass is probably the AmanicaePylae of Ptolemy, which he places 5' further souththan Jtsus, and 1C east of Issus. Alexander, hearing that the Persians were in hisrear, turned back to the Pylae, which he reached atmtduight, and halted till daybreak, when he movedon. (Arrian, Anab. ii. 8.) So long as the roadwas narrow, he led his army in column, but as thepass widened, he extended his column into line, parttowards the mountain and part on the left towardsthe sea. When he came to the wide part («opfx&jota),be arranged his army in order of battle, whichArrian describes very particularly. Darius wasfated on the north aide of the Pinarus. It is plain,lp'tn this description, that Alexander did not marchvery fir from the Pylae before he reached the widerpart of the valley, and the river. As the sea wason lua left, and the mountains on his right, the riverwas a stream which ran down from the SyrianAmanos; and it can be no other than the DeliTtckai, which is about 13 miles north of the Camus(Merkei), direct distance. Polybius (xii. 17), whocrmd-esCallUthenes's description of the battle, (states,on his authority, that Darius descended into Ciliciathrough the Pylae Amanides, and encamped on thePinarus, at a place where the distance between themountains and the sea was not more than 14 stadia;and that the river ran across this place into the sea,and that in its course through the level part "itbad abrupt and difficult eminences (Arf^ouj)." Thisi* explained by what Arrian says of the banks ofthe river being steep in many parts on the north«d«. (Anab. ii. 10.) Callisthenes further said, that*hen Alexander, after having passed the defile (to"»"), heard of Darius being in Cilicia, he was1"0 stadia from him, and, accordingly, he marchedb*ck through the defile. It is not clear, from the extract in Polybius, whether the 100 stadia are tobe reckoned to Issus or to the Pinarus. Accordingto Arrian, when Alexander heard of Darius beingbehind him, he sent some men in a galley back toIssus, to see if it was so; and it is most consistentwith the narrative- to suppose that the men sawthe Persians at Issus before they had advanced tothe river; but this is not quite certain. The Per­sian army was visible, being near the coast, as itwould be, if it were seen at Issus. Strabo (p. 676), following the historians of Alex­ander, adds nothing to what Arrian has got fromthem. Alexander, he -says, led his infantry fromSoli along the coast and through the Mallotis toIssus and the forces of Darius; an expression whiclimight mislead, if we had no other narrative. Healso says, after Mallus is Aegae, a small town witha harbour, then the Amanides Pylae [AmanidesPylae], where there is a harbour; and after Aegaeis Issus, a small town with a harbour, and the riverPinarus, where the fight was between Alexanderand Darius. Accordingly he places Issus north of,the Pinarus. Cicero, during his proconsulship ofCilicia, led his forces against the mountaineers ofthe Amanus, and he was saluted as imperator atIssus, "where," he says, "as I have often heardfrom you, Clitarchus told you that Darius was de­feated by Alexander." There is nothing to be gotfrom this. (Ad Fain, ii. 10.) In another passage,he says that he occupied for a few days the samecamp that Alexander had occupied at Issus againstDarius. (Ad Alt v. 20.) And again (ad Fam.xiv. 20), lie says that, " he encamped for four daysat the roots of the Amanus, at the Arae AlexandriaIf this is the same fact that he mentions in hisletter to Atticus, the Arae were at Issus, and Issuswas near the foot of the Amanus. The battle between Septimius Severus and Nigerwas fought (a. l>. 194) somewhere about Issus; butnothing can be collected from the description ofHerodian (iii. 12), except that the battle was notfought on the same ground as Alexander's, thoughit was fought on the gulf of Issus. Steplmnus (s. v.'Ioffor) describes it as "a city between Syria andCilicia, where Alexander defeated Darius, which wascalled, for this reason, Nicopolis by him; and there isthe bay of Issus; and there, also, is a river namedPinarus." Strabo, after speaking of Issus, men­tions, on the Issjc gulf, Rhosus, and Myriandrus, andAlexandria, and Nicopolis, and Mopsuestia, in whichdescription he proceeds from the Syrian side of thegulf, and terminates with Mopsuestia on the Py-ramuB. According to this enumeration, Nicopoliswould be between Alexandria (Scanderoon) andMopsuestia; and it may be near Issus, or it maynot. Ptolemy (v. 8. § 7, 15. § 2) places Nicojiolisexactly one degree north of Alexandria and 50' northof Issus. He places Issus and Khosus in the samelongitude, and Nicopolis, Alexandria, and Myriandrus10' further east than Issus. The absolute truth ofhis numbers is immaterial. A map constructedaccording to Ptolemy would place Issus at the headof the gulf, and Nicopolis inland. Nicopolis is oneof the cities which he enumerates among the inlandcities of Cilicia Proper. Issus, then, being at the head of the gulf, andTarsus being a fixed point in the march of Cyrus,we may now see how the matter stands with Xeno-phon's distances. Cyrus marched 10 parasangsfrom Tarsus to the river Psaru8(Sarus), SUiun, andcrossed at a place where it was 300 feet wide F 4

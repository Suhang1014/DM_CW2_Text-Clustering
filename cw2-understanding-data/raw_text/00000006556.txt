The Lacedæmonians, in the same winter, joined bytheir allies, those of Corinth excepted, and marchinginto Argia, ravaged a small part of that territory, andcarried off the corn, having brought carriages for thatpurpose. They also removed the Argive exiles to Or-nea, and left them a small detachment from their mainarmy for the security of their persons. A temporarytruce being also made, during which the Orneatæ andArgives were to abstain from all hostilities against oneanother, they drew off the army to their respectivehomes. However, not long after this, the Athenians arrivedwith thirty sail of ships and six hundred heavy-armed.The Argives, in conjunction with the Athenians, tookthe field with all their strength, and besieged those inGrnea for the space of a day. But, as at night the be­siegers removed to a distance in order for repose, thoseof Ornea made their escape. On the day following,the Argives, when sensible of their escape, levelled Or­nea with the ground, and then withdrew. And after­wards the Athenians re-embarked for Athens. The Athenians also threw in by sea a party of horse-'men into Methone, a frontier-town on Macedonia."With these, consisting of their own citizens and suchMacedonians as had refuged among them, they harras-sed the country belonging to Perdiccas. But the Lace­dæmonians sent a summons of aid for Perdiccas to theChalcideans of Thrace, who kept terms with the Athe­nians by truces renewed every tenth day: These howe­ver refused to march. Thus ended the winter, and withit the sixteenth year of the war, of which Thucydideshath compiled the history. YEAR

Itai viii. 380).must have been si touted in the district of the Pon­tine Marshes, and was probably merely the name ofsome portion of the swamps included under thatmore general designation. The line of the Appian Way was carried in aperfectly straight line through the Pontine Marshesfrom the station Sub Lanuvio, at the fi>ot of theAlb.in Hills, to within a short distance of Tarracina.The stations along its course and the distances aredifferently given in the Itineraries; but they may allhe readily determined with the assistance of inscrip­tions and Roman milestones still existing. At thebeginning of the marshes, or rather in the leveltract immediately adjoining them, was the station ofTints Taukknak, distant 17 miles from Aricia, atpoint where a branch road from Antium fell intothe Appian Way. The site of this was fixed by theAbbe' Chaupy and other writers at a place calledIa Castellf, 2 miles on the Roman side of Cisterma;but there seems no reason to reject the distancesgiven in the Antoninc Itinerary, which would placeit 5 miles further from Home, or 3 miles beyondCisterna, where some ruins still remain, referred by |Chaupy to the station Ad Sponsas of the JerusalemItinerary, but which wuuld suit equally well forthose of Tres Tabernae. [Tit us Tabbbkab.]Six miles from this spot, and just 39 miles fromIi'ome (as shown by a milestone still remainingthere), is a place still called Torre tU Treptmti,marking the site of TRBPOMTIirM, the spot fromwhence the canal of the Dccennovium commenced,and from which therefore the 19 miles from whichit derived its name were measured. Four milesfurther on considerable remains mark the site ofFORUM Ami, which in the Augustan age was abusy and thriving town; but in the fourth centuryhad sunk to a mere Mntatio or post station. TheAntonine Itinerary gives the distance from Rome toForum App'ii at 43 miles, which is exactly correct;from thence to Tarracina it reckons 18 miles; theJerusalem Itinerary makes the distance 19 miles,and give* an intermediate station called Ad Medias(Paludes), which was 9 miles from Forum Appiiand 10 from Tarracina. The site of this is stillmarked by a spot called Torre di Mesa, where astriking Roman monument still remains; but thereal distance from Forum Appii is only 8 miles,which coincides with the Antonine Itinerary, {/tin.Ant. p. 107; Jtin. Hitr. p. 611.) The whole ofthis part of the road has been carefully examinedand described by the Abbe' Chaupy {Decowcrte dein Mcdton d'Horace, vol. iii. pp. 382—452); andthe distances discussed and corrected by Westphal,{Rom. Kampat/ne, pp. 67—70). [E.

Ant. pp. 236, 257; Not.Imp.) It is commonly believed that its site is nowmarked by the village of Pfunzen, which in themiddle ages bore the name of Pen tana; but Mnchar{Soricum. i. p. 285) identities it with Emudorfnear Kraibtirf/.

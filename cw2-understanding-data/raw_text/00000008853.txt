The castle occupies a hill pro-ice ting from the last falls of the mountain ofKhassiA; but the only traces of tlie ancient citywhich Leake could discover were some small remainsof Hellenic masonry, forming part of the wall of thecastle, and some squared blocks of stone of the sameaces dispersed in different parts of the town. (Leake,Northern Greece, vol. i. p. 425, seq., vol. iv. p. 287.) TRICCIA'NA, a place in PannonU, in tlie valleycalled Cariniana (ft. Ant. p. 267). It is probablythe same as the Gurtiana noticed in the Pent. Table,as the difference in the statements about the dis­tances amounts only to 2 miles. [L. S.J TRICESIMAE, in Gallia, one of the places men­tioned by Ammianus Marcel linus (xviii. 2) in thelist of those places along the Khenish frontierwhich Julian repaired. Ammianus mentions Tri-eesimae between Quadriburgiuin and Novesium. [QlJADRIBOROIUM.] [G. L.] TRICESIMUM, AD, in Gallia. D'Anville ob­serves that the ancient Itins. contain many positionswith similar names, which names of places are de­rived from the distances which they indicate from theprincipal towns; for the distances within the de­pendent territory were measured from the principaltowns. This Tricesimum is measured from Narbo(Narbnnve), as the Jerusalem Itin. shows, on theroad to Toulouse, through Carcassonne. Trebeson the canal of Languedoc may represent the name;and Tricesimum mav be near that place. [G. L.]TRICHO'NIS LACUS. [Aktolia, p. 64, a.]TKICHO'NIUM (Tpixdnov: Etk. Tpixwuvs), atown of Aetolia, from which the lake Trichoma de­rived its name. [Respecting the lake, see Vol. I. p. 64,a.] Its position is uncertain. Leake places it S. ofthe lake at a place called Gavala, and Kiepert, inhis map K. of the lake. Rut since Strabo mentionsit along with Stratus as situated in a fertile plain, itought probably to be placed N. of the lake (Strab. x. p.450; Pol. v. 7; Steph. Ii. k. p.). It was evidently aplace of importance, and several natives of this townare mentioned in history. (Pol. iv. 3, v. 13, xvii. 10;Pans. ii. 37. § 3; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. i.p. 155.) TRICOLOR!.

Hannibal in his march fromthe Rhone to the Alps passed into the country oftheTricorii, as Livy says [Tkicastwi]. Strabo(iv.pp. 185, 203) says in one passage that above theCavares are "the VocontU and Tricorii and Iconiiand Moduli," from which we learn tliat lie consideredthe Tricorii as neighbours of tlie Vocontii; and inanother passage ho says, "after the Vocontii are theIconii and Tricorii, and next to them the Meduli,who occupy the highest summits of the Alps."Some geographers concluile that tlie Tricorii must beon the Jtrac, a branch of the [sire, in the southernpart of the diocese of Grenoble, But if the Tricoriiwere in the valley of the 7>rw, we do not thereforeadmit that Cannibal's march to the Alps wasthrough that valley.

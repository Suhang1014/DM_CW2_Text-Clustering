Their ter­ritory was thus included in the region known to theGreeks by the name of Iapygia, as well as in thedistrict called by the Romans Calabria. Straboremarks that the peninsula in question, which heconsiders as bounded by a line drawn across fromTarentum to Brundusium, was variously called Mes-sapia, Iapygia, Calabria, and Salentina; but thatsome writers established a distinction between thenames. (Strab. vi. p. 282.) There seems no doubtthat the names were frequently applied irregularlyand vaguely, but that there were in fact two distincttribes or races inhabiting the peninsula, the Salra-tines and the Calabrians (Strab. vi. p. 277). of whomthe latter were commonly known to the Greeks aathe Messapians [Cauaihha]. Both were, how­ever, in all probability kindred races belonging to thaigreat family of the Pelasgian stock. Tradition 1sented the Salentines as of Cretan origin,according to the habitual form of suchascribed them to a Cretan colony nnder Idafter the Trojan War. (Strab. vi. p. 2S2:Am. iii. 400; Fast. t. v.

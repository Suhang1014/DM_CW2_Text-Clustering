Either the Roman landlord was expelled by hisstrong and insolent guest; or the annual payment, athird of the produce, was exchanged by a more equitabletransaction for an adequate proportion of landed property.Under these foreign masters, the business of agriculture,in the cultivation of corn, vines, and olives, was exercisedwith degenerate skill and industry by the labour of theslaves and natives. But the occupations of a pastoral lifewere more pleasing to the idleness of the barbarians. Inthe rich meadows of Venetia, they restored and improvedthe breed of horses for which that province had oncebeen illustrious ;u and the Italians beheld with asto­nishment a foreign race of oxen or buffaloes." The de­population of Lombardy, and the increase of forests, af­forded an ample range for the pleasures of the chace.yThat marvellous art which teaches the birds of the air toacknowledge the voice, and execute the commands, oftheir master, had been unknown to the ingenuity of theGreeks and Romans.2 Scandinavia and Scythia produce t Paul, lib. 2. c. 31, 32. lib. 3. c. 16. The laws of Rotharis, promulgaied A. D.643. do not contain the smallest vestige of this payment of thirds; but they pre­serve many curious circumstances of the state of Italy and the manners of the Lom-hards. 11 The studs of Dionysius of Syracuse, and his frequent victories in the Olympicgames, had diffused among the Greeks the fame of the Venetian horses ; but the breedwas extinct in the time of Strabo.

The buffaloes, whose native climate appears to beAfrica and India, are unknowu to Europe, except in Italy, where they are numerousand useful. The ancients were ignorant of these animals, unless Aristotle (Hist.Animal, lib. 2. c. 1. p. 58. Paris 1783.) has described them as the wild oxen of Ara-chosia. See Buffon. Hist. Naturelle, tom. 11. and Supplement, tom. 6; Hist.

Yet I must not conceal the suspicion that Paul, bya vulgar error, may have applied the name of buhalus to the aurochs, or wild bull, ofancient Germany. y Consult the twenty-first Dissertation of Muratori. 1 Their ignorance is proved by the silence even of those who professedly treat ofthe arts of hunting and the history of animals. Aristotle, (Hist. Animal, lib. 9. o. 36.tom. 1. p. 586. and the notes of his last editor, M. Camus, tom. 2. p. 314.) Pliny,(Hist. Natur. lib. 10. c. 10.) iElian, (de Natur. Animal, lib. 2. c. 42.) and perhapsHomer, (Odyss. 22. 302—306.) describe with astonishment a tacit league and com­mon chace between the hawks and the Thracian fowlers.

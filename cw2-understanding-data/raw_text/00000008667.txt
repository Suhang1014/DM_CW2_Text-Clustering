According to the former, they were anIndian nation (vi. 21 ; cf. Diod. xvii. 105), whowore the same arms and dress as those people,but differed from them in manners and institutions(Ind. c. 23).

[Barbana.] ORME'NIUM ('Opuevtov), a town of Thcssaly,mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships along withHypcreia and Asterium as belonging to Kurvpylus(Horn. II. ii. 734). It was said to have been foundedby Ormenus, the grandson of Aeolus, and was thebirthplace of Phoenix. (Demetr. Seepsius, ap. Strah.ix. p. 438, seq.) Strabo identifies this town witha place in Magnesia named Orminium, situated atthe foot of lit Pel ion, at the di-tance of 27 htadiafrom Demetrias, on the road passing through loleoa,which was 7 stadia frum Demetrias and 20 fromOrminium. (Strab. /. e.) Leake, however, observesthat the Ormenium of Homer can hardly have beenthe same as the Orminium of Strabo, since it appearsfrom the situation of Asterium that Kurvpylus ruledover the plains of Thessahotis, which are watered bythe Apidanus and Knipeus.

'Opvtdrr}s), a town inthe Argeia, mentioned in the Iliad (ii. 571), whichis said to have derived its name from Orneus, theson of Erechtheus. Orneae retained its ancient Cy-nurian inhabitants, when Argos was conquered bythe Dorians. It continued independent of Argos fora long time; but it was finally conquered by theArgives. who removed the Omcatae to their owncity. (Paus. ii. 25. § 6, viii. 27. § 1.) Thucy-dides mentions (v. 67) the Orneatae and Cleon.ieias allies (tTu/i/uaX01) of the Argives in B.C. 418;and the same historian relates (vi. 7) that Orneaewas destroyed by the Argives in b. c. 416. (Comp.Diod. xii. 81.) It might therefore be inferred thatthe destruction of Orneae by the Argives in b. c.416 is the event referred to by Pausanias. ButMiiJler concludes from a well-known passage of Hero­dotus (viii. 73) that Orneae had been conquered byArgos long before; that its inhabitants were reducedto the condition of Perioeci; and that all the Perioeciin the Argeia were called Orneatae from this place.But the Orneatae mentioned by Thucydides couldnot have been Perioeci, since they are called allies;and the passage of Herodotus does not require, andin fact hardly admits of, Muller's interpretation.■ The Cynurians," says Herodotus (/. <?.), "havebecome Doricized by the Argives and by time, beingOrneatae and Perioeci."

Itrived its Dame probably from its form, being situ-d on an elevated platform, as it were a table aboveilea; though the town of Trapezus in Arcadia'.'tided to be the motber-city of Trapezus in Pon-i (Pans. viiL 27. § 4). Trapezus was already airabing town when Xenophon arrived there on memorable retreat; and he and his men wereit hospitably treated by the Trapezuntians. (Xen.•i. v. J. § 10.) At that time the Colchians * *till in poaaession of the territory, but it after-<i* was occupied by the Macrones. The real great-& of Trapezus, however, seems to have commencedler the dominion of the Romans. Pliny (vi. 4)a it a free city, a distinction which it had pro-ly obtained from Pamper daring his war againsturiciates. In the reign of Hadrian, when Arrianted it, it was the most important city on the southt «f the Koxine, and Trajan had before made itcapital of Pontus Cappadocicus, and provided it- a larger and better harbour.

Per. 087 ), it continued to be in such excel-ciAuilion, that in the reign of Justinian it re­nt but few repairs. (Procop. de Aed. iii. 7.)n the Notitia Imperii (c. 27) we learn thatarxoa was the station of the first Pontian legionits stafT. Some centuries later a branch of thenal house of the Comneni declared themselvesundent of the Greek Empire, and made Tra-j the seat of their principality. This small principality maintained its independence even forsome time after the fall of Constantinople; hutbeing too weak to resist the overwhelming power ofthe Turks, it was obliged, in A. l). 1460, to submitto Mohammed II., and has ever since that time beena Turkish town. (Chalcond. ix. p. 263, foil.; Doc.45; comp. Gibbon, Decline, c. xlviii. foil.) Thoport of Trapezus, called Daphnus, was fonned bythe acropolis, which was built on a rock runningout into the sea. (Anon. Ptripl. P. E. p. 13.) Thocity of Trebizond is stHI one of the most flourishingcommercial cities of Asia Minor, but it contains noancient remains of any interest, as most of thembelong to the period of the Lower Empire. (Toumc-fort, Voyage au Tyrant, iii., lettre 17, p. 79, foil.;Fontanier, Voyage* dam f Orient, p. 17—23;Hamilton's Researches, i. p. 240.) The coins ofTrapezus all belong to the imperial period, and ex­tend from the reign of Trajan to that of Philip.(Eckhel, i. 2. p. 358; Sestini, p. 60.)' [L.S.] TRA'PEZU'S (ToowefoSj, -oSmt: Etk. Tpos-f-foOiriot), a town of Arcadia in the district Parrhasia,a little to the left of the river Alpheius, is said to havederived its name from its founder Trapeze us, the sonof Lycaon, or from trapeza (rpd*t(a), h a table,"because Zeus here overturned the table on whichLycaon offered him human food. (Pans, viii. 3. §§2,3; Apollod. iii. 8. § 1.) It was the royal residenceof Hippothous, who transferred the seat of govern­ment from Tegea to Trapezus. On the foundationof Megalopolis, in n. r. 371, the inhabitants of Tra­pezus refused to remove to the new city; and havingthus incurred the anger of the other Arcadians, theyquitted Peloponnesus, and took refuge in Trapezuson the Pontus Euxeinus, where they were receivedas a kindred people. The statues of some of theirgods were removed to Megalopolis, where they wereseen by Pausanias. Trapezus stood above the mo­dem Mavrid.

It is the largest of all thelakes of Etruria, being above 10 miles in length by8 in breadth: and diners from all the other con­siderable lakes of that country in not being ofvolcanic origin. It is merely formed in a depressedbasin, surrounded on all sides by hills of moderateelevation, and having no natural outlet. The hillson the X. side of the lake, which extend fromCrotona to Perusia, are considerably more elevatedthan those that form the other sides of the basin,but even these scarcely rise to the dignity of moun­tains. The lake itself is of small depth, nowhereexceeding 30 feet, and its banks are almost every­where low, flat, and covered with reeds.

It seems to have leen inf early linw a powerful and important city, asart cam* to the tribe of the Sarsinates CSapai-„, put). wbo were one of the most considerableit I'raurian tribes. Indeed some authors speaktaea as if they were not included in the Urn-all, but fiirmed a separate tribe withrot national character. Thus Polybius,jrur the farces of the Italian nations,iu of the Umbriana and Sarsinates, and Flautua, in one passage, makes a similar distinction.' (Pnl. ii.24; Plant. Motte.lL iii. 2. 83.) The Fasti Capito-lini, also, in recording the conquest of the Sarsinates,speak of the two consuls as triumphing " de Sarsi-natibus," without any mention of the Umbrians;but the Epitome of Livy, in relating the same event,classes them generally among the Umbrians. (Liv.Epit. xv.; Fast. Capit.) The probable conclusion isthat they were a tribe of the Umbrian race; butwith a separate political organisation. We have noparticulars of the war which ended in their subjec­tion, which did not take place till B. c. 2*56, so thatthey were one of the last of the Italian states thatsubmitted to the Roman yoke. From this timeSarsina was certainly included in Umbria in theRoman sense of the term, and became an ordinarymunicipal town, apparently not of much importance.(Strab. v. p. 227; Plin. iii. 14. s. 19.) It derivedits chief celebrity from its being the birthplace ofthe celebrated comic poet Plautus, who was borathere about B. c 254, very shortly after the Romanconquest. (Hieron. Chron. ad 01. 145; Fest. ». v.Plotiu, p. 238.) Its territory contained extensivemountain pastures, — whence it is called by SiliusItalicus " dives lactis" (Sil. Ital. viii. 461),—as wellas forests, which abounded in dormice, so muchprized by the Romans. (Martial, iii. 58. 35.) Va­rious inscriptions attest the municipal rank of Sar-sina under the Roman Empire (Orell. Inscr. 4404;Gruter, Inter, p. 522. 8, p. 1095. 2); but its nameis not a^ain found in history. In the middle agesit sunk into complete decay, but was revived in the13th century, and is now a small town of 3000 in­habitants, which retains the ancient site as well asname. [E. H.

Peut., whereit is called Arauena, whence Aquae Arauenae; It.Ant. p 202, where its name is Sacoena). It is bysome believed to be the modern Batlyan. [L. S.] SARUNE'TES.the name of an Alpine people (I'lin.iii. 20. s. 24) in the valley near the sources of theRhine. There seems no reason to doubt the correct­ness of the name, and it may be preserved in Sargant,which is north of Chur, and between Chw and theLake of Constant. In a passage of Caesar (B.G. iv.10) he mentions the Nantuates as a people in theupper part of the Rhine, above the Helvetji. Thoname Nantuates [Nabtuatks] is corrupt; and it ispossible that the name Sarunetes should be in itsplace. [G. L.] SARUS (Sapor), one of the principal rivers in thosouth-east of Asia Minor, having its sources in MountTaurus in Cataonia. It first flows in a houth-eastern direction through Cappadocia by the town ofComana; it then passes tlmnieh Cilicia in a south­western direction, and, after flowing by the town ofAdana, empties itself into the Cilician sea, on thosouth of Tarsus, after dividing itself into severalbranches. (Liv. xxziii. 41.) According to Xenoplmn(Anab. i.4. § 1) its breadth at its mouth was 3 pletbraor 300 feet; and Frocopius (de Aedif. v. 4) i-avsit was a navigable river. (Comp.

(Xen. Hell. i. 1.§21.) Some time after this, however, he gainedpossession of the place through the treachery ofsome of the townspeople, and, having levied a con­tribution npon its inhabitants, left a garrison in it.(lb. 3. § 10; l'lut. Alcib. 30.) Selymbria is men­tioned by Demosthenes (/. c.) in B. c. 351, as in alli­ance with the Athenians; and it wis no doubt atthat time a member of the Byzantine confederacy.According to a letter of Philip, quoted in the ora­tion d> Corona (p. 251, It), it was blockaded by himabout B. c. 343; but Professor Newman considersthat this mention of Selymbria is one of the numerousproofs that the documents inserted in that speechare not authentic. {Class.

Strab. xvii. p. 786), who says that theyoccupied aa island above Meroe; that their nameimplies u immigrants;" that they descerided fromthe Aegyptian war-caste, who, in the reign of Psain-mitichus (b. c. 658), abnadoned their natiro land;and that tbey were governed by a queen, althoughthey were also dependent on the sovereigns of Meroe.Artemidorus, also quoted by Strabo (xvi. p. 770),says on the contrary, that they were the ruling orderin Meroe: these accounts, however, may be recon­ciled by the supposition that Eratosthenes and Arte­midorus described them at different periods. If theSembritae were the Aegyptian refugees, they werealso the Automoloi CAauix) noticed by Herodotus(ii. 30). l'liny (/. c.) speaks of four islands of tlieSembritae, each containing one or more towns. Thesewere therefore not islands in the Nile, or in any ofits principal tributaries, the Astapus, or Astaboras,but tracts between rivers, mesopotamian districtslike Men* itself, which in the language of Nubiaare still denominated " islands." The capital of theSembritae was, according to Pliny, Seinbobis. Itstood on the left bank of the river, 20 days' jour­ney above Meroe". Pliny names also, among other oftheir principal towns, Sai in Arabia, — i. e. on theright bank of the Nile, for he assumes that river asthe boundary between Lybia and Arabia, — Esar or 3<j

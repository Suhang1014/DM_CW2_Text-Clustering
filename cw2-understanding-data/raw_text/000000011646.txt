XII.] NATIONALITY, RELIGION, AND EDUCATION. 425 character of Ostia, Puteoli, and Brundisium, where withforeign wares foreign manners also first found admissionand became thence more widely diffused. The immediate result of this complete revolution in the Mixture ofrelations of nationality was certainly far from pleasing, peoples.Italy swarmed with Greeks, Syrians, Phoenicians, Jews,Egyptians, while the provinces swarmed with Romans;sharply defined national peculiarities everywhere came intomutual contact, and were visibly worn off; it seemed as ifnothing was to be left behind but the general impress ofutilitarianism. What the Latin character gained in extent,it lost in freshness; especially in Rome itself, where themiddle class disappeared the soonest and most entirely,and nothing was left but the grandees and the beggars,both in an equal measure cosmopolitan. Cicero assuresus that about 660 the general culture in the Latin towns 90.was higher than in Rome; and this is confirmed by the litera­ture of this period, whose pleasantest, healthiest, and mostcharacteristic products, such as the national comedy andthe Lucilian satire, were the native growth of Latium or ofthe Latin colonies.

Here is a difficulty: the last isa well-known place, but the distance is evidentlymuch too small: and the various attempts made toidentify the intermediate positions rest on no sufficientdata. The alteration of Ad Adrum to Ad Anamli is no sign in the MSS. to bear it out. It seems,on the whole, most likely that the route intended isthat of the great road through Talticera la Htnl,fiahjoz, and Elan*. From Kbora, it proceedsthus:—Salacia, 44 M.

The country S. of this mndwas traversed by others, connecting Ebora withPax Jii.ia, nnd both with the Anas and the Scoast; namely: — 6. (Itin.

P.(ftrjn), is so intricate as to prove an error in theItinerary, which commentators have sought in vainto amend. 7. The direct road from Esiris to PaxJt'LIA is given thus (Itin.

From Oli-bipo a great road ran parallel to the coast, up tothe mouth of the Durius and Bracaha Al'oi.'kta,thus (Itin. Ant. pp. 420—422): Jkhabkiua,30 M. P. (rid. mp.); Scalabis, 32 M. P.

S.] LUTETIA PAMSIO'RUM (Aou*<rr«io, Pt.J.ii. 8. § 13: AovKOTottia, Strabo. p. 194). the cityof the Parisii, a Gallic people on the Seine, Luleiiais mentioned by Caesar (li. G. vi. 3), who held ameeting of the Gallic states there in the spring ofB. c. 53. He calls it Lutetia Parisiorum ; and inhis narrative of the operatioas of Labienus in B- c52, be says (B. G. vii. 57) that Lutetia is on anisland in the Seqiuina (Seine). Strabo copies thisdescription from Caesar. Vibius Sequester (p. IIed. Oberlin) also describes Lutecia, as be writes it,as being on an Island. The Parisii were the neighbours of the Sefionex,There had been some kind of political union brtweeathe Parisii and the Scnnncs before Caesar's UaJliecampaigns (B. G. vi. 3). but at the time whenCaesar mentions them, they seem to have oe«-nseparate states. When Vercingetorix (n. c. 52) n»eagainst the Homans, the S-nones, l'ari-sii. and otliTsjoined him immediately; and the Parisii sent 8OU0men to oppose Caesar at Alesia (B. G. vii. 4, 75).Though a part of the little territory of the Pan-iiwas north of the Seine, we must osiejado frfniCaesar's narrative that they were a Celtic people.The diocese of Paris repre.-*nts llie ten'itory ot' theParisii. Lutetia, like many other Gallic towns, finallytook the name of the people, ajid was railed Civita*Parisiorum, whence the modern name of Parim./.osimus (iii. 9) calls it Parisiutn. It appears fi ■ ithe Notit. Dign. that the Homans had a fleet atParis ; and from the words in the Notitia. " Prar-t'ectus classis Andcritianonun Parisiis," D'Anti.l*conjectures that the name "Anderitiani" implies ai place Anderitium, which he further supposes to be| Andriti, immediately below the jmu'.i.ji of thoStine and Oite. An inscription dug up in 1711among other ancient monuments in the church of| .Voire I)ame at Parit, contained the words " KanUeParisiaci:" and I)e Valuis observes that as tl»people of Paris had always a fleet before their eyes,they may from this circumstance have taken tl^ship which appears in the arms of the city.

That the Xavalia were inthe Campus Martins may also be inferred fromLivy (xlv. 42): "Naves regiae captae de Mace-donibus inusitatae ante magnitudinis in CatnpoMartio subductae sunt"; and from Plutarch's ac­count of the return of tbe younger Cato fromCyprus, in which he relates that although the ma­gistrates and senate, as well as a great part of theRoman population, were ranged along both banks ofthe Tiber in order to greet him, yet he did not stopthe course of his vessels till he arrived at theNavalia (Cat Min. 39); a circumstance whichshows that this arsenal must have lain towardsthe upper part of the stream's course throughthe city. Hence, though we cannot define theboundary between the Janieulum and the Vatican, jnor consequently the exact situation of the Prata;Quinctia, yet the site fixed upon by Becker for the'Navalia, namely, between the Piazza. Xarona and 1f'orOj diRipitta, seems sufficiently probable. I'relleris disposed to place them rather lower down thestream, but without any adequate reason (Regionen,Ann. p. 242). It was Caesar who began the great changes inthe Campus Martins to which we have beforealluded. He had at one time meditated the giganticplan of diverting the course of the 'liber from theMilvian bridge to the Vatican hill, by which theAger Vaticanus would have been converted into anew Campus Martins, and the ancient one appro­priated to building; but this project was never car­ried into execution. (Cic. ad Ait. xiii. .33.) Theonly building which he really began in the Campuswas the Skfta JruA. Jt has been said, whentreating of the Porta Flumentana, that a spot nearthe Circus Flaminins was appropriated to the hold­ing of the Coinitia Centuriata. In early times itwas enclosed with a rude kind of fence or boundary,probably of hurdles: whence, from its resemblanceto a sheep-fold, it obtained the name of Ovile, andsubsequently of Septa. (Liv. xxvi. 22; Juv. vi. 528;Serv, ad Virg. Ac. i. 34.) For this simple andprimitive fence Caesar substituted a marble building(Septa marmorea), which was to be surrounded witha portico a mile square, and to be connected with;the Villa Publico, (Cic. ad AH. iv. 16.) It wasprobably not much advanced at tbe time of Caesar'sassassination; since we find that it was continuedby the triumvir Lepidus, and finally dedicated byAgrippa (l>ion Cass. liii. 23); hut whether it was |completed on tbe magnificent plan described by \Cicero cannot be said. Its situation may be deter- jmined by a parage in Frontinus. in which he says Ithat the arches of the Aqua Virgo ended in theCampus Martins in front of the Septa. (Aq. 22.)These arches, which, as we have seen before, beganunder the gardens of Lucullus on the Pincian, wereconducted to the baths of Agrippa. Donati men­tions that remains of them were discovered in Ins [time in trout of the church of S. fyiMzit) (near the jCMgio Romano), (De L'rb. R. iii. 18.) Thiscoincides with remains of the portico of the Septa!existing under the Palazzo Dovia and church of*S". Maria in Via Lata in the Corto (Canina, Indie. -400); and we may therefore conclude that the SeptaJulia stood at this spot. The portico must have 1enclosed a large open space where the assemblieswere held, and in which gladiatorial shows, and on I one occasion even a naurnaeh'u, were fslu-.^t(Suet. Aug. 43, Col. 18, A'er. 12; Dion Cms it.8, lis. 10.) There was of eour>e a s>or£?*Ki3 «■rostra, for haranguing the people.

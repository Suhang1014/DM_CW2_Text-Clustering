The Winter following, Evarchus the Acarnanian, whohad a great desire to recover Astacus, prevailed with the Co足rinthians to carry him thither, with a fleet of forty ships,and a force of fifteen hundred heavy-armed, and endeavourto re-establish him. He himself also hired some auxiliariesfor the same purpose. This armament was commanded byEuphymadas son of Aristonymus, Timoxenus son of Timo-crates, and Eumachus son of Chrysis ; who sailing thitherexecuted their business. They had a mind to endeavour thereduction of some others of the maritime towns of Acarna-nia, but miscarrying in every attempt they made, they re足turned home. But in their passage touching at Cephallene,and debarking upon the lands of the Cranians, they weretreacherously inveigled into a conference, where the Cra足nians falling suddenly upon them, kill some of their men.It was not without difficulty, that they drew the others safelyoff, and gained their own ports. But the same Winter, the Athenians, in conformity tothe established custom of their country, solemnized a publicfuneral for those who had been first killed in this war, in the manner as follows; The bones of the slain are brought to a tabernacle erectedfor the purpose three days before, and all are at liberty todeck out the remains of their friends at their own discretion.But when the grand procession is made, the cypress-coffinsare drawn on carriages, one for every tribe, in each of whichare separately contained the bones of all who belonged tothat tribe. One sumptuous bier is carried along empty forthose that are lost, whose bodies could not be found amongstthe slain. All who are willing, both citizens and strangers,attend the solemnity ; and the women who were related tothe deceased, stand near the sepulchre groaning and la足menting. They deposit the remains in the public sepulchre.

The city of Jerusalem was fortified with three walls,on such parts as were not encompassed with unpassable val­leys ; for in such places it hath but one wall. The city wasbuilt upon two hills, which are opposite to one another, andhave a valley to divide them asunder; at which valley thecorresponding rows of houses on both hills end. Of thesehills that which contains the upper city is much higher, andin length more direct. Accordingly, it was called the Cita­del by king David; ho was the father of that Solomon whobuilt this temple :it the first; but it is by us called the Up­per Market-place. But the other hill, which was calledAcra, and sustains the lower city, is of the shape of a moonwhen she is horned: over against this there was a third hill,but naturally lower than Acra, and parted formerly from theother by a broad valley. However, in those times when theAsamoneans reigned, they filled up that valley with earth,and had a mind to join the city to the temple. They thentook off part of the height of Acra, and reduced it to be ofless elevation than it was before, that the temple might besuperior to it. Now the valley of the cheesemongers, as itwas called, and was that which we told you before dis­tinguished the hill of the upper city from that of the lower,extended as far as Siloam ; for that is the name of a fountainwhich hath sweet water in it, and this in great plenty also.But on the outsides these hills arc surrounded by deep val-lcvs, and, by reason of the precipices to them belonging onboth sides, they are every where unpassable. 2. Now of these three walls the old one was hard to betaken, both by reason of the valleys, and of that hill on whichIt was built, and which was above them. But besides thatgreat advantage, as to the place where they were situated,it was also built very strong; because David and Solomon,and the following kings, were very zealous about this work.

Rhod.177, 675; Anon. Peripl. P. E. p. 3.) Accord-to Ptolemy (v. 1. § 15) it was also called Da­tura, and obtained its name of Thynias from therai, who inhabited the opposite coast. The islanda port and a naval station belonging to Hera-• (Nrylax, p. 34; Arrian, i c); and Mela (it 7) is probably mistaken in believing that the islandcontained a town of the same name. (Comp. Strab.xii. p. 543, where it is called Thynia; Marxian, p.69; Stcph. B. e. v.; Orph. Argon. 717, where itbears the name Thyneis.) The modern name of theisland is Kirpek. [L.

It is of a semicircular form,nearly 7 miles in circumference, and rises from thesea to the height of 700 feet. There are manyapertures and clefts in the rocks, the abodes of in­numerable pigeons, and from the window-like formof these holes the whole promontory has received thsname of Thyrides. Strabo describes it as a Aow&nt*(rr|^»ftj, "a precipitous cape beaten by the winds,"distant 130 stadia from Taenarum (reckoning fromthe northern point of Thyrides) ; Pauaanias, as apromontory (axpa), situated 70 stadia from Taena­rum (reckoning from the southern point of the pro­montory X Pauaanias likewise calls it a promontoryof Taenarum, using the latter word in its widestsense, to signify the whole peninsula of Mant Ac­cording to Strabo, the Messenian gulf terminated atthis promontory. Pliny (iv. 12. a 56) mentionsthree islands of the name of Thyrides in the Asinaeangulf.

Cicero tells us (ml Fan. xvi. 5) that insailing from Alyzia to Leucas, he touched at Tby-rium, where he remained two hours; and from thisstatement, as well as from the history of the eventsin which Thyrium is mentioned, wo may infer thatit was situated on or near the Ionian sea, and thatit was the first town on the coast S. of the canal

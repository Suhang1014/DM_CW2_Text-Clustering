Ilieros. p.568) was a port or castle (Castra, Plin. v. 9. s. 10)on the borders of Aegypt and Aethiopia, and alter­nately attached to either kingdom. Parembole wassituated between Syenc and Taphis, on tlie left bankof the Nile, lat. 23° 40' N. In Roman times it wasnut' <if the principal fortresses of the southern ex­tremity of tlie empire, and was usually occupied byu legion. On the recession of the Roman boundaryin Diocletian's reign, Parembole was handed over tothe Nubae, and was frequently assailed by theItlemmyes from the opposite bank of the river.(1'rocop. B. Pers. i. 19.) The ruins of its templesmay still be seen at the village of Ihbot or Debou.From the square enclosure of brick found there itwould seem to have ken a penal settlement forcriminals as well as a regular station for soldiers.(Rosellin.

Ant. p. 271; Tab. Pent.-. Anon. Rav.iv. 31.) From the mention of the name by Ste-phanus of Byzantium («. r.) it is probable that itexisted as an Istriau town previous to the Romansettlement there. Pliny calls it an " oppidum civinmRomarmrutn," anil it would seem that it was alreadyone of the most considerable town-, in the province,though it did not then enjoy the rank of a colony.But we learn from inscriptions that it subsequentlyattained this rank under Trajan, and bore thetitles of Colonia Ulpia Parentiurn (Orcll. Inner.72. 3729; Zumpt, dt (.'ohm. p. 402.) In commonwith the other cities of Istna, its most flourishing period belongs to the close of the Western E'nfin.The modern city of Partnzo is a small place, totretains its episcopal see, which dates fwiwearly period.

Herodotus, who visited Thasos, saysthat the most remarkable mines were those workedby the Phoenicians on the eastern side of the islandbetween Aenyra and Coenyra opposite Samotlirace,where a large mountain had been overturned insearch of the gold. (Herod, vi. 47.) The Thasiansappear to have been the only Greeks who workedthe valuable mines in Thrace, tilt Histiaens, theMilesian, settled npon tlie Strymon and built thetown of Myremus, about n. c. 511. (Herod, v. 11,23.) Alter the capture of Miletus (it. c. 494). His-tiaeus made an unsuccessful attempt to subdueThasos (Herod, vi. 28), but the growing power ofthe Thasians excited the suspicions of Dareins,who commanded them in B.C. 492 to pull downtheir fortifications and remove their ships of war toAbdera,—an order which they did not venture todisobey. (Herod, vi. 4b\) When Xerxes marchedthroiiL'h Thrace on his way to Greece, the Thasians,on account of their possessions on tlie mainland,had to provide for the lVr>i:m army as it marchedthrough their territories, the ca>t of which amountedto 400 talents (92.600/.). (Herod, vii. 118.) Afterthe defeat of the Persians, Thasos became a memberof the confederacy of Delos; but disputes having:iiisen between the Thasians and Athenians re­specting the mines upon the mainland, a warenvied, ami the Athenians sent a powerful forceagainst the island under the command of Cimon,n. c. 4G">. After defeating the Thasians at sea,the Athenians disembarked, and laid .siege to thecity both by land and sea. The Thasians held outttMiv than tw<» years, and only surrendered in thethird year. They were compelled to raze their for­tifications; to surrender their ships of war; to giveup their continental possessions; and to pay an im­mediate contribution in money, in addition to theirannual tribute. (Time. i. 100, 101 j Diod. xi. 70;Pint. Cim. 14.) In B.C. 411 the democracy inTliasos was overthrown, and an oligarchical go­vern ment established by 1'eisander and the FourHundred at Athens; but as soon as the oligarchyhad got possession of the power they revolted fromAthens, and received a Lacedaemonian garrison andharmost. (Thuc. viii. 04.) Much internal dis­sension followed, till at length in B.C. 408 a partyof the citizens, headed by Ecphantus, expelled theLacedaemonian harmost Eteonicus with his gar­rison and admitted Thrasybulus, the Athenian com­mander. (Xen. Hell. i. i. 12, 32, i. 4. § 9;llein. c.Lept p. 474.) After the battle of Aegos-potamos, Thasos passed into the hands of the Lace-daemonians; but it was subsequently again de­pendent upon Athens, as we see from the disputesbetween Philip and the Athenians. (Dem. tie Union.p. 80; Philipp. Epiat. p. 159.) In the Roman wars inGreece Thasos submitted to Philip V. (Polvb. xv.24), but it received its freedom from the Komansafter the battle of Cynoscenhalae, B.C. 197 (Polyb.xviii, 27, 31; Liv. xxxiii. 30, 3.r»), and continuedto be a tree {libera) town in the time of Pliny(iv. 12. s. 23). The city of Tliasos was situated in the northernpart of the island, and possessed two ports, of whichone was closed. (Seylax, p. 27; Pto!. iii.

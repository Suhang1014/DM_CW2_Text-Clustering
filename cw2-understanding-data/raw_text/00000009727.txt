INTRODUCTION. 7 It is farther my opinion, that the assemblage of that ar­mament by Agamemnon was not owing so much to the at­tendance of the suitors of Helen in pursuance of the oathsthey had sworn to Tyndarus, as to his own superior power.4t is related by those who received from their ancestors themost certain memorials of the Peloponnesian affairs, thatPelops, arriving there from Asia with abundance of wealth,soon gained so great an influence over those needy people,that, though a foreigner, he had the honour to have theCountry called after his own name ; and that the power thusgained by him was successively enlarged by his posterity.Eurystheus indeed, whose mother was the sister of Atreus,perished in Attica by means of the Heraclida e ; and Euryst­heus, when he departed on that expedition, left the govern­ment of Mycenae and his kingdom, because of his affinity,in the care of Atreus, who then resided with him, havingfled from his father upon the murder of Chrysippus.

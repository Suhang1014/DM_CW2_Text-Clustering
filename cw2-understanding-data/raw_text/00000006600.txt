Various accounts are vented about this step inor can it certainly be known with what view he re­paired to Aspendus, or why, when there, he did notbring up the fleet. That a Phœnician fleet, confidingof one hundred forty-seven sail was now come up toAspendus, is allowed on all sides; but, why they didnot come forwards, is variously conjectured. Somethink he went out of sight merely to carry on his oldscheme of wearing away the Peloponnesians ; and, inconsequence of this, Tamas paid in their subsistencewhich he was ordered to pay, not better but even worsethan Tissaphernes. Others fay it was, that, since he save large sums by dismissing them there, as he neverhad sincerely designed to make use of their service.Others, again, attribute it to a desire to quiet the cla­mours against him at Lacedæmon, and to get himselfrepresented there as one abounding in good faith, andwho is actually gone to bring up a fleet fairly and ho­nestly fitted out for service. But, in my opinion, the true solution of the mysteryis this: He would not bring them up, merely to wearout and to balance the strength of the Grecians, that,during his absence and this studied prolongation, thelatter might be running into ruin and, farther, for thefake of balancing, to join with neither party, for fearof making them too strong; for, had he once determi­ned to join heartily in the war, the consequence was cer­tain beyond a doubt. Had he brought them up to jointhe Lacedæmonians, he must in all probability have gi­ven them the victory, since already their naval strengthwas rather equal than inferior to that of their opponents.But, that their ruin alone was designed by him is plainfrom the excuse he made for not bringing up that fleet:He pretended they were fewer in number than the kingbad ordered to be assembled: yet, if this were so, hemight have ingratiated himself more abundantly withthe kingy if he made a great saving of money for his mas* Phœnicians to Aspendus, he might A a 2 ter,

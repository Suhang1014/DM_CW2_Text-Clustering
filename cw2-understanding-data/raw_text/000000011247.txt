OCR Output THE HISTORY if I could, would I venture to pronounce an opi­nion; for I am aware that the matter is both remotein antiquity, and has been already treated by manyothers j the lateft writers always fuppofing them-felves capable, either of throwing fome new light onthe fubject, or, by the fuperiority of their talentsfor composition, of excelling the more inelegantwriters who preceded them. However that maybe, I mall, at all events, derive no fmall fatisfac-tion from the reflection that my beft endeavoursnave been exerted in tranfmitting to pofterity theatchievments of the greateft people in the world;and if, amidft fuch a multitude of writers, my namefbould not emerge from nbfcurity, I fhall confolemyfelf by confidering the diftinguimed reputation andeminent merit of thofe who ftand in my way in thepurfuit of fame. It may be farther obferved, tha;fuch a fubjecr. muft require a work of immenie ex­tent, as our refearches muft be carried back througha fpace of more than feven hundred years j that theftate has, from very fmall beginnings, gradually in-crcafed to fuch a magnitude, that it is now diftreffedby its own bulk; and befides, that there is every reafonto apprehend that the generality or readers will receivebut little pleafure from the accounts of its firft origin,or of the times immediately fucceeding, but will beimpatient to arrive at thefe modern times, in whichthe powers of this overgrown ftate have beenlong employed in working their own deftruction.On the other hand, I fhall efteem this as fomereward of my labour, that, fo long at leaf t as I fhallluve my thoughts totally occupied in inveftigatingthe tranfac~lions of fuch diftant times, without beingcmbarrafied by any of thofe unpleafing confidera-tions, which, though they might not have power towarp a writer's mind from the truth, would yet beflifficient to create uneafinefs, I fhall withdraw my-fe.lf from the light of the many evils to which ourcyes, in this age, have been fo long accuftomed. • As

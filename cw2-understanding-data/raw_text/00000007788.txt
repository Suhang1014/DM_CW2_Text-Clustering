Plinyterms it a navigable river (" uavigiorum capax"),and Rutilins describes it as forming at its moutha tranquil and secure port. (Plin.iii. 5. s. 8;Rutil. Jtin. i. 337—340.) It flows near the modemcity of Gro&seto, and within a few miles of theruinsof Rusellae. The name of Umbro is considered tobe connected with the Umbrians, who held thispart of Italy previous to its conquest by the Etrus­cans : and according to Pliny, the coast district ex­tending from its mouth to Telamon, was still knownas the " tractus Umbriae." (Plin. /. c.) [E. H. Ii.] UNELLI or VENELI (OveVeAoi). one of the Ar-moric or maritime states of Gallia. (B. G. ii. 34, iii.11.) Caesar mentions them with the Veneti, Osismi,Cunosolitae, and other maritime states, The Upelliand the rest submitted to P. Crassus in B.C. 57; butin B.C. 5G it was necessary to send a force again intothe country of the UnelH, Curiosolitae, and Lexovii.Q. liturius Sabinus had the command of the threelegions who were to keep the UnelH and their neigh-bouts quiet. The commander of the Unelli was Viri-dovix, and he was also at the head of all the forcesof the states which had joined the Unelli, amongwhom were the Aulerci Eburovicea ami the Lexovii.The force oi Viridovi* was very large, and he wasjoined by desj*_-rate men from all parts of Gallia,robbers and those who were too idle totiil the ground.The Roman general entrenched himself in his camp,and made the Galli believe that he was afraid andwas intending to slip away by night. The trickdeceived the Galli, and they attacked the Romancamp, which was well placed on an eminence w ith asloping ascent to it about a mile in length. On theGalli reaching the Roman camp exhausted by arapid march up the hill and encumbered with thefascines which they carried for tilling up the ditch,the Romans tallied out by two gates and punishedthe enemy well for their temerity. They slaughteredan immense number of the Galli, and the cavalrypursuing the remainder let few escape. This clever(cut of arms is told clearly in the Commentaries. The L'uelli s«*nt a contingent of 6000 men toattack Caesar at the siege of Alesia. (#. G. vii.75.) Ptolemy (ii, 8. § 2) names Crociatonum thecapi;al of the Veneli.

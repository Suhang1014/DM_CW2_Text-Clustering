( Time. vi. 105.)Ju the Macedonian period Prasiae, with other La-conian towns on this coast, passed into the hands ofthe Arrives (Polvb. iv. 36); whence St mho calls itone of the Arrive towns (viii. p. 3G8), though inanother passage he says that it belonged at anearlier ]>eriod to the Lacedaemonians (viii. p. 374).It was restored to Eaconia by Augustus, who madeit one of the K knit hero-Lucnui an towns.

The name lias even been trans-*™<l to Europe, for the Tauriau Chersonesus in«r:u»ja and the Tanriaci in the Xorican AlpsijAar to owe their name to the same origin. Weunoc winder therefore when we find that Erato- ■ tran (ap. Strab. xv. 689) and Strabo (ii. pp. 68,U, i. p. 490) apply the name to the whole range I mountains extending from the Mediterranean toeastern ocean, although their connection is often n4<-x This extent of mountains is, according toEnW( calculation (si. p. 490), 45,000 stadia inIpfc, and 3000 in breadth. But in the narrower II common acceptation Mount Taurus is theKVI of mountains in Asia Minor which begins at>j«- Sacrum or Chelidonium on the coast of Eycia, ■ .fL for this reason is called by Mela (i 15) anday (v. 28) Pronionlorium Tauri.

The ono proceeds north-eastward underthe name of Antitaurus ('ArrfraupoT), and surpassesthe other in height. It rnns through Cappadocia.where it forms Mount Argaeus ('Ap7oios), andArmenia, where it is called Mons Capotes, andthrough the Montes Moschici it is connected with theCaucasus, while a more southerly branch, under thenames of Abus and -Min is or Ma-sis, runs throughArmenia towards the Caspian sea. The secondbranch, which separates itself on the frontiers ofCilicia and Lycaonia, retains the name of Taurus,and proceeds from Cilicia, where it forms the PortaeCiliciae, and sends forth Mons Amanus in a southerndirection, while the main branch proceeds throughCappadocia. After being broken through by theEuphrates, it again sends forth a southern branchunder the name of Mons Masius.

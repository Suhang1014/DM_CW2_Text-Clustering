At the head of a narrowglen, which leads to the principal pate, stand theruins of the temple of Nemesis upon a large arti­ficial platform, supported by a wall of pure whitemarble. But we find upon this platform, whichfunned the rtptvos or sacred enclosure, the remainsof ttro temples, which are almost contiguous, andnearly though not quite parallel to each other. Thelarger building was a peripteral hexastyle, 71 feetlong and .'l.'i broad, with 12 columns on the side,and with a pronaus, cella, and posticum in theusual manner. The smaller temple was 31 feetlung by 21 feet broad, and consisted only of a cella,with a portico containing two Doric columns i»ant is. Among the ruins of the larger temple aresome fragments of a colossal statue, correspondingin size with that of the Kbamnusian Nemesis; butthese fragments were made of Attic, marble, and notof Parian stone as stated by Pausanias. It is, how­ever, not improbable, as Leake has remarked, thatthe story of the block of stone brought by the Per­sians was a vulvar fable, or an invention of thepriests of Nemesia by which Pausanias was deceived.Among the ruins of the smaller temple was founda fragment, wanting the head and shoulders, of astatue of the human si/.e in the archaic style of theAeginetan school. This statue is now in the liritishMuseum. Judging from this statue, as well asfrom the diminutive size and ruder architecture ofthe smaller temple, the latter apjtfars to have beenthe more ancient of the two. Hence it has beeninferred that the smaller temple was anterior to thePersian War, and was destroyed by the Persiansjust before the battle of .Marathon; and that thelarger temple was erected in honour of the goddess,who had taken vengeance upon the insolence of thebarbarians for outraging her worship. In front ofthe smaller temple are two chairs (^»oVoi) of whitemarble, upon one of which is the inscription Nfjuctrej'S.uaTparot avtdrjutv, and upon the other 06,ui5<^.wrrrparos avf07}KfV, which has led some to supposethat the smaller temple was dedicated to Themis.Hut it is more probable that both temples were dedi­cated to Xemcsis, and that the smaller temple wasii! ruins before the larger was erected. A difficulty,however, arises about the time of the destruction ofthe smaller temple, from the. fact that the forms ofthe letters and the long vowels in the inscriptionsupon the chairs clearly show that those inscriptionsbelong to aii era 1 >ng subsequent to the battle ofMarathon. Wordsworth considers it ridiculous tosuppose that these chairs were dedicated in this templeafter its destruction, and hence conjectures that thetemple was destroyed towards the close of the Pelo-ponne>ian War by t he Persian allies of Sparta,(Leake, fhmi of Attica, p. 105, seq.. 2nd ed.,North rn Greece, vol, ii. p. 434, seq.; Wordsworth.Athem and Attica, p. 34, seq.; Unedited Anti­quities of Attica, c. vi. p. 41, seq.) 2.

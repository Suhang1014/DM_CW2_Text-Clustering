TheGreek version of the voyage of Hanno gives thefollowing statement;— "On the third day afterour departure from the Chariot of the Gods (Qtwvuxvp*), having sailed l»y tho>e streams of fire(previously described), we arrived at a bay calledthe Southern Hon», at the bottom of which layan island like the former, having a lake, and inthis lake another island, full of savage people, thegreater part of whom were women, whose bodieswere hairy, and whom our interpreters called Go-rillae. Though we pursued the men, we could notseize any of them; hut all fled from OS, escapingover the precipices, and defending themselves withstones. Three women were, however, taken ; butthey attacked their conductors with their teeth andhands, and could not be prevailed upon to accom­pany us. Having killed them, wc Bayed them, andbrought their skins with us to Carthage. We didnot sail further on, our provisions failing us." Asimilar story is told by Eudoxus of Cyzicus, asquoted by Mela (iii. 9; comp. l'lin. v. 1.) Thesefires do not prove volcanic action, as it must be re­collected that the common custom in those countries—as, for instance, among the Mamiingns, as reportedby Mungo Park—of setting fire at certain seasonsto the forests and dry grass, might have given riseto the statements of tho Carthaginian navigator. Inour own times, the island of Amsterdam was setdown as volcanic from the same mistake. (Dauheny.Volcanoes, p. 440.) The " Chariot of the Gixls"lias been identified with Sagres; the distance ofthree days' sail agrees very well with S/itrboro, tothe S. of Sierra Leone, while Man no's bland co­incides with that called Maeasdeu in the charts, thepeculiarity of which is, that it has on its S. shore,«ir sea face, a lake of pure fresh water of consider­able extent, just within high-water mark; and in­side of, and close to it, another still larger, salt.(Jonm. Ceog. Soc. vol. ii. p. 89.) The Gorillae,no doubt, belonged to the family of the nntliropoidapes; the Mamiingns still call the u Orang-Outan"by the name " Toorilla," which, as Kings (ap. Mi'tl-Ur, I.e.), the latest editor of Hanno, observes, might the form it bears easily assume the form it bears in the Gwfctext.

And since thesepeople knew that their friendship was very disagreeable toHerod, as tending to do him a mischief, they contrived thattheir meetings should not be discovered ; so they pretendedto hate one another, and to abuse one another when time ser­ved, and especially when Herod was present, or when anyone was there that would tell him ; but still their intimacywas firmer than ever, when they were private. And this was-the course they took ; but they could not conceal from Salomeneither their first contrivance, when they set about these theirintentions, nor when they had made some progress in them ;but she searched out every thing ; and, aggravating the rela­tions to her brother, declared to him, " As well their secret" assemblies and compotations, as their counsels taken in a" clandestine manner, which, if they were not in order to" destroy him, they might well enough have been open and" public.

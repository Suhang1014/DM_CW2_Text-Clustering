Imay therefore be allowed to say, that I have carefully examinedall the original materials that could illustrate the subject whichI had undertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the extensivedesign which has been flcetched out in the preface, I might per­haps conclude it with a critical account of the authors consultedduring the progress of the whole work j and however such anattempt might incur the censure of ostentation, I am persuaded,that it would be susceptible of entertainment as well as information. At present I shall content myself with a single observation. TheBiographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine,composed, or rather compiled, the lives of the emperors, fromHadrian to the sons of Carus, are usually mentioned under thenames of Ælius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, Ælius Lampridius,Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiscus.But there is so much perplexity in the titles of the MSS; and so manydisputes have arisen among the critics (fee Fabricius Biblioth. Latin.I. iii. c. 6.) concerning their number, their names, and their re­spective property, that for the most part I have quoted them with­out distinction, under the general and well known title of theAugustan History.

VII and his Sicarii got possession of the fortress by treachery.These fruits were also fresh and full ripe, and no way inferiorto such fruits newly laid in, although they were little short of ahundred yearsl from the laying in these provisions [by Herod]till the place was taken by the Romans; nay, indeed, whenthe Romans got possession of those fruits that were left, theyfound them not corrupted all that while; nor should we bemistaken if we supposed that the air was here the cause oftheir enduring so long, this fortress being so high, and so freefrom the mixture of all terrene and muddy particles of matter.There was also found here a large quantity of all sorts of wea­pons of war, which had been treasured up by that king, andwere sufficient for ten thousand men: there was cast iron, andbrass, and tin, which show that he had taken much pains tohave all things here ready for the greatest occasions: for thereport goes how Herod thus prepared this fortress on his ownaccount, as a refuge against two kinds of danger; the one,for fear of the multitude of the Jews, lest they should deposehim, and restore their former kings to the government: theother danger was greater and more terrible, which arose fromCleopatra, queen of Egypt, who did not conceal her inten­tions, but spake often to Antony, and desired him to cut offHerod, and entreated him to bestow the kingdom of Judcaupon her.

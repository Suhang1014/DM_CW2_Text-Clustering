Pliny calls it tlie Maxeras (vi.It i IS). It is not certain with which modemil b to be identified, and geographers havepiven it to the Tedjin, the Babul, or the'••ram. If Airunianos, who speaks of it in con-«■ m. with the Oxus, could be depended on, ittprcar most probable that it was either thei*s*«r the Gmyan. The people dwelling alongnw were called Maxerae.

(Relnnd,Palaestina. pp. 891, 892.) [G. W.] MAXU'LA (Mo{otAo, Ptol. iv. 3. § 7), a Roman"colonia" (Maxulla, Plin. v. 3), about the exactdistance of which from Carthage there is a consi­derable discrepancy in the Itineraries (Anton. Jtin.;Peul. Tab.). From an expression of Victor Vitensis(de Persecut. Vandal, i. 5. § 6), who calls it " Li-gula," "a tongue of land," its position was probably onthe coast, between R'ades and llammam-eUEvf,where there are the remains of a Roman road. The Coast-describer (Stadiasm.') speaks of theharbour and town of Maxyla as 20 stadia fromCrapis, or the modern Garbcs: this was probablydifferent from the former, and is the modem J/rwa,where there are the remains of a town and harbour(Shaw, Trav. p. 157; Barth, Wanderwigen, p. 128.)As connected with the gentile epithet Maxyes orMazyes, it is likely that there were several places ofthis name. Ptolemy (iv. 3. § 34) has MaxuiaVetus (Md{oi>Aa riaAaia), and the AntonineItinerary a station which it describes as MaxulaPrates, 20 11. P. from Carthage. It is found inthe Notitia, and was famous in the annals of Mar-tyrology (Augustin, Serin, c. lxxxiii; Morcelli,Africa Christiana, vol. i. p. 220.) [E. B. J.] MAXYES (Ma^ufi, Herod, iv. 191, where thename should be Mafuts ; see Mauretania, p. 297,a.), a Libyan tribe, and a branch of the nomad Au-senses. Herodotus (I. c.) places them on the "otherside," i. e. the W. bank, of the river Triton: reclaimedfrom nomad life, they were "tillersof the earth, andaccustomed to live in houses." They still, however,retained some relics of their former customs, as"they suffer the hair on the right side of theirheads to grow, but shave the left; they paint theirbodies with red-lead :" remains of this custom ofwearing the hair are still preserved among theTuaryks, their modem descendants. (Hornemann,Trav. p. 109.) They were probably the samepeople as those mentioned by Justin (xviii. 7), andcalled Maxvtaki, whose king is said to have beenHiarbas (Virg. Aen. iv. 36,196, 326), and to havedesired Dido for his wife. (Heeren, African Nations,vol. i. p. 34, trans.; Rennell, Geog. of Herod, vol. ii.p. 303.) [E. B. J.] MAZACA. [Caesareia, Vol. I. p. 469, b.] MAZAE1 (Ma^oTot), a Pannoniau tribe, occu­pying the southernmost part of Pannonia, on thefrontiers of Dalniatia, whence Dion Cassius (Iv.32) calls them a Dalmatian people. They wereconquered and severely treated by Gcrmanicu*.(Strab. vii. p. 314 j Plin. iii. 26; Ptol. ii. 16.§ 8.) [L. S.] MAZARA (Ma'fapo, Diod.; Mafaprf, Steph. Ii.:Mazzara), a town on the SW. coast of Sicily, situ­ated at the mouth of a river of the same name, be­tween Selinus and Lilybaeum. It was in earlytimes an inconsiderable place, And is first noticed byDiodorus in B. c. 409, as an emporium at themouth of the river Mazarus. (Diod. xiii. 54.) Itwas evidently at this time a dependency of Selinns,and was taken by the Carthaginian general Han­nibal, during his advance upon that city. (Diod./. c.) Stcphanus of Byzantium calls it " a fort ofthe Selinuntincs" (tppobpiov XtKiyovvriuv, Steph.B. s. v.), and it is mentioned again in the FirstPunic War as a fortress which was wrested by theRomans from the Carthaginians. (Diod. xxiii. 9.p. 503.)

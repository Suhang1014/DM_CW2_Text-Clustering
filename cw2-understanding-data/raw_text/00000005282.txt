The judicious criticism of Mr.Moyle perceived, and maintained against his uncleDr. Prideaux, the antiquity of the Persian prophet.See his work, vol. ii. [8] That ancient kKom was called the Zend.The language of the commentary, the Pehlvi, thoughmuch more modern, has ceased many ages ago to bea living tongue. This fact alone ;if it was receivedas authentic) sufficiently warrants the antiquity ofthose writings, which M. d'Anquetil has broughtinto Europe, and translated into French. [9] Hyde deReligione veterum Persarum, c. 21. [10] I have principally drawn this account fromthe Zendavesta of M. d Anquetil, and the Sadder,subjoined to Dr. Hyde's treatise. It mull, however,be confessed, that the studied obscuricy os a prophet,the figurative style of the east, and the deceitfulmedium of a French or Latin version, may havebetrayed us into error and heresy, in this abridg­ment of Persian theology. [11] The modern Perfees (and in some dcgre«the Sadder) exalt Ormufd into the first and omni­potent cause, whilst they degrade Akriman into aninferior but rebellious spirit. Their desire of pleas­ing the Mahometans may have contributed to refinetheir theological system. [iz] Herodotus, I. i. c. 131. But Dr. Prideauxthinks, with reason, that the use of temples wasafterwards permitted in the Magian religion. [13] Hyde de Relig. Perf. c. 8. Notwithstand­ing all their distinctions and protestations, whichseem sincere enough, their tyrants the Mahometans,have constantly stigmatised them, as idolatrous vvor-fliippers of the fire. [14] See the Sadder, the smallest part os whichconsists of moral precepts. The ceremonies en­joined are infinite and trifling. Fifteen genuflex­ions, prayers, &c were required whenever the de­vout Persian cut his nails or made water; or as oftenas he put on the sacred girdle. Sadder Art.14. 50. 60.

He informsus (as far as we may credit him) of two curious par­ticulars; 1. that the Magi derived some of theirmost secret doctrines from the Indhn Brachmans;and, 2. that they were a tribe or family, as wejl asorder. [19] The divine institution of tythes exhibits asingular instance of conformity between the law ofZoroaster- and that of Moses. Those who cannototherwise account for it, may suppose, if they please,that the Magi os the latter times inserted so usefulan interpolation into the writings of their prophet. (20] Sadder, Art. 8.

OCR Output THE DECLINE AND FALL chap. certain intelligence that the emperor of the West hadxx' fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of trans­ports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone, heTheodosius was suddenly informed that the great Theodosius, recovers Africa, with a small band of veterans, had landed near Igil-a.d. 373. gilisj or Gigeri, on the African coast; and the timidusurper sank under the ascendant of virtue and mili­tary genius. Though Firmus possessed arms andtreasures, his despair of victory immediately reducedhim to the use of those arts which, in the same coun­try, and in a similar situation, had formerly beenpractised by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted todeceive, by an. apparent submission, the vigilance ofthe Roman general ; to seduce the fidelity of his troops;and to protract the duration of the war, by succes­sively engaging the independent tribes of Africa toespouse his quarrel, or to protect his flight. Theo­dosius imitated the example, and obtained the success,of his predecessor Metellus. When Firmus, in thecharacter of a suppliant, accused his own rashness,and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor,the lieutenant of Valentinian received and dismissedhim with a friendly embrace; but he diligently re­quired the useful and substantial pledges of a sincererepentance; nor could he be persuaded, by the as­surances of peace, to suspend, for an instant, theoperations of an active war. A dark conspiracy wasdetected by the penetration of Theodosius; and hesatisfied, without much reluctance, the public indig­nation, which he had secretly excited. Several ofthe guilty accomplices of Firmus were abandoned,according to ancient custom, to the tumult of a mili­tary execution; many more, by the amputation ofboth their hands, continued to exhibit an instructivespectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels wasaccompanied with fear; and the fear of the Romansoldiers was mingled with respectful admiration.

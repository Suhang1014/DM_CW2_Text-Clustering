Measures were also taken in the senate, on amotion made by Quintus Fabius Maximus, to recon­cile them to each other; for there subsisted betweenthem an avowed enmity, which, on the side of Livms,was the more inveterate, as, during his misfortunes,he had felt himself treated with contempt by the other.He was therefore the more obstinately implacable, andinsisted, that ' there was no need of any reconcilia­tion: for they would conduct all business with thegreater diligence and activity, while each should beafraid, lest a colleague, who was his enemy, mightfind means of exalting his own character at the other'sexpense.' Nevertheless, the influence of the senateprevailed on them to lay aside their animosity, andto act with harmony and unanimity in the administra­tion of the government. The provinces allotted tothem were not, as in former years, a joint command inthe same districts, but quite separate, in the remotestextremities of Italy: to one, Bruttium and Lucania,where he was to act against Hannibal; to the other,Gaul, where he was to oppose Hasdrubal, who was nowsaid to be approachingto the Alps. It was ordered thatthe consul to whose lot Gaul fell should of the twoarmies (one of which was in Gaul, and the other inEtruria,) choose whichever he thought proper, and jointo it the city legions; and that he to whom the pro­vince of Bruttium fell should, after enlisting new le­gions for the city, take his choice of the armies com­manded by the consuls of the preceding year; andthat the army left by the consul should be given toQuintus Fulvius, proconsul, and that he should con­tinue in command for the year. To Cains Hostilius,to whom they had assigned the province of Tarentum,in exchange for Etruria, they now gave Capua instead.One legion was ordered for him,—that which Fulviushad commanded the year before.

Barygazenus (Gulf ofCambay), not far from tho town of Beroach. In thePrripl. M. Erythr. (Gtoyr.

[Naqf.iri.]NANTUATES, a people who bordered on theAllobroges, who in Caesar's time were includedwithin the limits of the Provincia. Caesar (/?. G.iii. 1) at the close of the campaign of B.C. 57 sentServius Galba with some troops into the country ofthe "Nantuates Veragri and Scduni, who extendfrom the borders of the Allobroges, the LacusLemannus and the river Khone to the summits ofthe Alps." The position of the Seduni in the valleyof the Khone about Sitten or Sum, and of theVeragri lower down at Martigny or Martinack,being ascertained, we must place the Nantuates inthe Chablais, on the south side of the I*eman lake,a position which is conformable to Cac-ars text.Strabo (iv. p. 204) who probably got his informationfrom Caesar's work, speaks "of the Veragri, Nan-tuatae, and the Leman lake;" from which wemight infer that the Nantuates were near the lake.An inscription in honour of Augustus, which ac­cording to Guii-henon's testimony was found atMaurice, which is in the Yalais lower down thanMartigny, contains the words " Nantuates patrono;"and if the inscription belongs to the s|«t where it isfound, it is some evidence that the Nantuates werein the lower part of the Yaliis. But if the Nan­tuates were neighbours of the Allobroges, they musthave extended westward along the south hank ofthe lake into the Chabltiis. The Chablais is thaipart of Savoy which lies along the Leinua lake between the Arre and the Yalait. It is wit rertaiihow far the Allobroges extended along the L»tn«alake east of Geneva, which town was in thairteiritory. It has been observed that the wordA'ont in the Celtic language signifies '• ninnicgwater;" and it is said that in the dialect of Savoy,every little mountain stream is called XeaU, andthat there are many streams of this name. A'aalis also a Welsh word for stream. There is another passage in Caesar, where thename Nantuates occurs in the common texts (B. G.iv. 10), which has caused great difficulty. He saysthat the Khenns rises in the country of the Lrpwituwho occupy the Alps, and that it flows by a locgdistance (longo spatio) through the country of theNantuates, Helvetii, and others. Walckenarr afF.nr.i(Giog. cfe. vol. i. p. 558) that the best and liegreater part of the MSS. of Caesar have Yatuatiam;but this is not true. The readines in this pa--e*reare Nantuatium, Natuanlium, Vatuantium, Jtaa-tuantium, and some other varieties. (Caesar, ed.Schneid.) Strabo (iv. p. 192) says tint the Aetusiae(AiVomtTai) inhabit the first part of the coarse ofthe Hhine, and that the somces of the river arein their country near Mount Adulas. Caaaubonchanged Aetuatac into Nantuatae to make it agreewith Caesar's text, and Cluver clianged it intoHelvetii. Both changes are opposed to sound criti­cism. The name in Caesar's text is not certain,and in Strabo it may be wrong, but nothing isplainer than that these people, whatever is theirname, are in the valley of the Rhine. Oberlin inhis edition of Caesar lias put the name ** Sarune-tium" in place of "Nantuatium;" but the Sa-runetes of Pliny were in the valley of Sargims.Groskurd (Transl. Strab. vol. i. p. 192) has adoptedthe alteration "Helvetii" in his translation; andvery injudiciously, for the Helvetii were not in thehigh Alps. Ukcrt (Gallien, p. 349) would abaalter Strabo's Aetuatae into Nantuatae to fit thecommon text of Caesar ; and he gives his rxpUr-atjunof the position of the Nantuatae, which is a verybad explanation. The Nantuates occur among theAlpine peoples who are mentioned in the Trophy ofAugustus (Plin. iii. 20). and they are placed that:"Lepontii, Uberi. Nantuates, Seduni, Veragri," fromwhich, if we can conclude anything, we may con­clude that these Nantuates are the Nantuates uf tb«hover Yalais. [G. I..] NAPAEI.

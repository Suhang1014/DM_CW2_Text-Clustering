Pliny and Tacitus(Ann, xii. 27, Germ. c. 2S) also describe theVangionea as Germans and settled on tlie left bankof the Rhine, where they are placed by Ptolemy (ii.9. § 17); but Ptolemy makes a mistake in placing theNemetes north of the Vanpiones, and making theVangiones the neighbours of the Tribocci, from whomin fact the Vanpiones were separated by tiie Nemetes.in the war of Civilis (Tacit. Hist. iv. 70), Tutorstrengthened tlie force of the Treviri by leviesraised among tlie Vangionea, Caracates [Caka-CATEs], anil Tribocci. The territory of the Van-giones seems to have been taken from that of theMediomatrici. Their chief town was Borbetomagus( Worms). [Borbetomagus.] [G. L.] VA'NNIA (Ohavvlc^ Ptol. iii.

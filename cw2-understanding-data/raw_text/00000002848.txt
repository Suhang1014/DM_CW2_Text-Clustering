And those leperswho had departed from Samaria, and were gone to the campof the Syrians, of whom we made mention a little before, whenthey were in the camp, saw nothing but great quietness and si­lence : accordingly they entered into it, and went hastily into oneof their tents, and when they saw nobody there they eat anddrank, and carried garments and a great quantity of gold, andhid it out of the camp ; after which they went into another tent,and carried off what was in it, as they did at the former, andthis did they for several times, without the least interruptionfrom any body.

ROMAN HISTORY. 317 birth nor your families, but to your. admission into theorder of senators, an honour, to which you were eitherpromoted by the kings, or after their expulsion, by thesuffrages of the people. Why do not you lay yourwise heads together, to preserve ihe pretended purityof your blood, by chnsing neither wives among us your足selves, nor permitting your female line to marry anyman, but a Patrician? No Plebeian will force a Patri足cian lady. That is an orbit in which a Patrician canonly move. Nobody will force you to enter into amarriage contract, unless it be agreeable to yourselves.But to prohibit it by law, and to make the marriage ofa Plebeian with a Patrician felony, is affronting us inthe highest degree. Why have you not passed thesame interdiction with respect to the rich and the poor?At all times, and in every nation upon earth, it has beenleft to the choice of parties, to settle upon the family,into which a woman should be disposed of in marriage,and upon that, out of which they should take a \vife;but this liberty you restrain by the sanction of a lawthe most insulting in the world, that you may make abreach in .civil society, and split one community intotwo. Why do not you also forbid the Plebeians tolive in the neighbourhood of the Patricians, to walk inthe same streets with them, to eat at the same table,or to assemble with them in the forum? And what isthe difference pray, in all these things, in the mar足riage of a Patrician with a Plebeian, or of a Plebeianwith a senator's daughter? Would the privileges ofthe orders be invaded or infringed by an instance ofthis kind? Not at all. For the children will alwaysbe of the rank with the father. In short we have noother view in moving this affair, but to be treated asmen and citizens; and the man who will set up his faceto oppose so just a requisition, can have no other mo足tive, but to make us appear in the light of scoundrelsand vagabonds.

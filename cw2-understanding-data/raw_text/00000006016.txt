OCR Output FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS. 375 done ample justice to all who died with glory; to Epi-charis, the enfranchised slave, who displayed her con­stancy, in defiance of the keenest torture; to Seneca,■who left an example of unshaken virtue ; to SubriusFlavius, whose last words to Nero were, " I hated you" when you became a coachman, a comedian, and an" incendiary," to Sulpicius Asper, the centurion; and,above all, to Lucan himself, who died with undauntedcourage, repeating a passage from his own poem. Letit also be remembered, that when Lucan's father suffereddeath in the following year, Tacitus says, that the sonreflected the highest honour on the father; grande adju-onentum claritudinis. The writer who has treated Lucanwith so much candour, would neither adopt noi* invent acalumny, to brand his name in the page of history. Butto conclude this long note : It is by no means probable,that Tacitus, who wrote in the reign of Trajan, notmuch more than thirty years after the death of Lucan,■would hazard a glaring falsehood in the face of his con­temporaries ; and it is less probable, that Mr. Hayley, atthe distance of more than n 30 years, should be betterinformed than the great historian, who lived at the verytime of the transaction.

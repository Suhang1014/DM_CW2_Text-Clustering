The eagerness of the troops, who pressedhim to nominate his colleague, was justified by thedangerous situation of public affairs; and Valentinianhimself was conscious, that the abilities of the mostactive mind were unequal to the defence of the di­stant frontiers of an invaded monarchy.

The East; and, V.The Danube; will impress a more distinct image ofthe military state of the empire under the reigns ofValentinian and Valens.

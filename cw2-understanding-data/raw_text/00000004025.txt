VIII.] TAKING OF THE UPPER CITT. 289 mans, when they had taken such great pains about weakerwalls, get by good fortune what they could never have gottenby their engines ; for three of these towers were too strongfor all mechanical engines whatsoever, concerning which wehave treated above. 5. So they now left these towers of themselves, or, rather,they were ejected out of them by God himself, and fled im­mediately to that valley which was under Siloam, where theyagain recovered themselves out of the dread they were in fora while, and ran violently against that part of the Romanwall which lay on that side; but as their courage was toomuch depressed to make their attacks with suflicient force,and their power was now broken with fear and affliction, theywere repulsed by the guards, and, dispersing themselves atdistances from each other, went down into the subterraneancaverns. So the Romans being now become masters of thewalls, they both placed their ensigns upon the towers, andmade joyful acclamations for the victory they had gained, ashaving found the end of this war much lighter than its be­ginning: for when they had gotten upon the last wall, with­out any bloodshed, they could hardly believe what they foundto be true; but seeing nobody to oppose them, they stood indoubt what such an unusual solitude could mean. But whenthey went in numbers into the lanes of the city, with theirswords drawn, they slew those whom they overtook withoutmercy, and set fire to the houses whither the Jews were fled,and burnt every soul in them, and laid waste a great manyof the rest; and when they were come to the houses to plun­der them, they found in them entire families of dead men,and the tipper rooms full of putrid corpses, that is, of such a3died by the famine; they then stood in horror at this sight,and went out without touching any thing. But although theyhad this commiseration, for such as were destroyed in thatmanner, yet had they not the same for those that wore stillalive, but they ran every one through whom they met with,and obstructed the very lanes with their dead bodies, andmade the whole city run down with blood, to such a degree,indeed, that the fire of many of the houses was quenchedIV. — 25

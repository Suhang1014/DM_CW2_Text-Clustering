Polybius's account of Philip's first invasion ofAetolia, which resulted in the capture of Therraum,supplies us with the chief information respectingthe towns in the central plain of Aetolia. Philipset out from Limnaea, on the south-eastern comerof the Anibraciot gulf, crossed the Achelous betweenStratus and Conope, and inarched with all speedtowards Thennum, leaving on his left Stratus Agri-niuin, and Thesticnses (0e<rn*?i), and on his rightConope. Lysimachia, Trichonium, and Phoeteum.He thus arrived at Metapa, on the lake Trichonis,and from thence marched to Thermus by the roiidalready mentioned, passing by Pampliia in his way.He returned by tlie same road as far as Metapa,hut from the latter place lie marched in one day toa place called Acrae, where ho encamped, and onthe next day to Conope. After remaining a day atConope, he marched up the Achelous, and crossed itnear Stratus. Tlie remains of tlie walls of Thennum showthat the city was about 2\ miles in circumference.It was in the form of a triangle on the slope ofa pyramidal hill, bordered ou either side by a tor­rent flowing in a deep ravine. The only remainsof a public edifice within the walls consist of asquare, pyramidal, shapeless mass of .stones. (Leake,Northern Greece^ vol. i. p. 120, &c.)THERVINGI.

(Strab.ix. p. 40«.J; Paus. ix. 20. § G; Steph. B. s. v.)Thespiae was said to have derived its name from'1 hespia, a daughter of Asopus, or from Thespius,a son ut Kicchtheus, who migrated from Alliens,(l'aus. I. c, \ Diod. iv. 29.) The city is mentionedin the catalogue of Homer. (//. ii. 41*8.) Thespiae,like Plataea, was une of the Boeotian cities inimicalto Tliebes, which circumstance affected its wholehistory. Thus Thespiae and Plataea were the onlytwo Boeotian cities that refused to give earth andwater to tlie heralds of Xerxes. (Herod, vii. 132.)Seven hundred Thespians joined Leouidas at Ther­mopylae; and they remained to perish with the 300Spartans, when the other Greeks retired. (Herod. vii. 202, 222.) Their city was burnt by Xerxes,when iie overrau liocotia, and the inhabitants with­drew to Peloponnesus (Herod, viii. 50.) Thesurvivors, to the number of 1800, fought at thebattle of l'lataea in the following year, but theywere reduced to such distress that they had noheavy armour. (Herod, is. 30.) After the expul-bion of the Persians from Greece, Thespiae wasrebuilt, and the inhabitants recruited their numbersby the admission of strangers as citizens. (Herod. viii. 75.) At the battle of Delium (b. c. 424)the Thespians fought on the left wing against theAthenians, and were almost all slain at their post.(Time. iv. *J3, seq.) In the following year (u. c.423;, the Thebans destroyed the walls of Thespiae,on tlie charge of AtticUin, the Thespians beingunable to offer any resistance in consequence of theliuavy loss they had sustained while lighting uponlit.- side of the Thebans.

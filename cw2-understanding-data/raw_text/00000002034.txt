After this popular con­cession, Justinian proceeded to the hippodrome to con­fess his own errors, and to accept the repentance of hisgrateful subjects; but they distrusted his assurances,though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the holygospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their distrust, re­treated with precipitation to the strong fortress of thepalace. The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputedto a secret and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion wasentertained, that the insurgents, more especially thegreen faction, had been supplied with arms and moneyby Hypatius and Pompey, two patricians, who could nei­ther forget with honour, nor remember with safety, thatthey were the nephews of the emperor Anastasius.Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and pardoned, by thejealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as loyalservants before the throne; and, during five days of thetumult, they were detained as important hostages; till atlength, the fears of Justinian prevailing over his pru­dence, he viewed the two brothers in the light of spies,perhaps of assassins, and sternly commanded them to de­part from the palace. After a fruitless representation,that obedience might lead to involuntary treason, theyretired to their houses, and in the morning of the sixthday, Hypatius was surrounded and seized by the people,who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the tearsof his wife, transported their favourite to the forum ofConstantine, and, instead of a diadem, placed a rich collaron his head.

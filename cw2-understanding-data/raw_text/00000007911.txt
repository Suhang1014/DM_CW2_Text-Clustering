According to Dionysius it was one of thecities founded by the Aborigines soon after theirsettlement in Latium (Dionys. i. 16), a proof atleast that it was regarded as a place of great anti-ijuity. Livy also reckons it as one of the cities ofthe Prisci Latini (i. 33). which may perhaps pointId the same result, while Diodorus includes it in hislist of the colonies of Alba. (Diod. vii. ap, Euseb.Arm. p. 185.) It was attacked by the Romanking Ancus Marcius, who took the city, and trans­lated the inhabitants to Koine, where he settledthem on the Aventine, together with those of Poli-Ittrium and Ficana. (Liv. i 33; Dionys. iii. 38,43.)Tellenae, however, does not seem, like the other twoplaces just mentioned, to have been hereby reducedto insignificance; for its name appears again in B.C.493 among the confederate cities of the Latin League(Dionys. v. CI); and though this is the last mentionthat we find of it in history, it is noticed both byStrabo and Dionysius as a place still in existence intheir time. (Dionys. i. 16; Strab. v. p. 231.) It isprobable, however, that it had nt that time falleninto complete decay, like Antemnae and Collatia; asit. is only mentioned by Pliny among the once cele­brated cities of Latium, which had left no traces oftheir existence in his day (Din. iii. 5. s. 9), andfrom this time its name wholly disappears. Thenotices of Tellenae afford scarcely any clue to itsposition; though the circumstance that it continuedto be inhabited, however slightly, down to the daysof Augustus, would afford lis more hope of beingable to identify its site than is the case with Poli­torium, Apiolae, and other places, which ceased toexist at a very early period. It is this reason thatlias led Nibby to identify the ruins of an ancientcity at La Gtostra, as those of Tellenae, rattier thanPolitorium, as supposed by Gell. [Politorium.]The site in question is a narrow ridge, bounded bytwo ravines of no great depth, but with abrupt andprecipitous banks, in places artificially scarped, andstill presenting extensive remains of the ancientwalls, constructed in an irregular style of massivequadrangular blocks of tnfo. No doubt can existthat these indicate the site of an ancient city, butwhether of Politorium or Tellenae, it is impossibleto determine; though the remains of a Roman villa,which indicate that the spot must have been in­habited in the early ages of the Empire, give someadditional probability to the latter attribution. LaGhstra is situated on the right of the Via Appia,about 2 miles from a farm-house called Fiorano,immediately adjoining the line of the ancient high­road. It is distant It) miles from Rome, and 3from Le Frattocckie, on the Via Appia. adjoiningiii'-ruins of liovillae. (Hell, T<>p. of Rome* pp. 280— 2S3; Nibby, Dintonti, vol. i:i. pp. 140—153.) Whether the proverfii.il expression of " tricae Tel­lenae" has any reference to the ancient city ofLatium or not, can hardly be determined, the originand meaning of the phrase being involved in com­plete obscurity.

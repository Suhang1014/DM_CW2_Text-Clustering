The account given by Serviusof tins statue lets been the subject of much dis­cussion, into which the limits of this article willnot permit us to cuter. The whole question lias beenexhausted by Creuzer. {Stud. ii. p. 282, seq.; cf.JSavigny, Gesck. d<s Rum. RecJUs, i. 52.) Near the rostra were also the statues (if the TurkuSibyls (Plin. xxxiv. II), which are apparentlythe same as the three Wlotptu or Fates, mentionedby Procopius. (/>. Goth. i. 25.) These also werelit the head of the forum, towards the temple ofJanus, a position which points to the same result asthe Duilian column with respect to the situation ofthe coinitium. Livy's description of a great fire which brokeout about the forum B.c. 211 afVords some topo­graphical particulars: "Intermpit hos sermonesnode, quae pridie Qulnquatrus fuit, pluribus simullocis circa forum incendium ortum. Eodera tem­pore septem Tabernae, quae posten quinque, etargentariae, quae nunc Novae appellantur, nrsere.Comprehensa r>istea privata aedificia, ncque enimturn basilicae erant: comprehensae Lautumiae, fo-rumque piseatorium, et atrium regium. Aedis Vestaevis defensa est" (xxvi. 27). As the fire, wilfullyoccasioned, broke out in several places, and as theCuria Hostilia does not seem to have been en­dangered, we may perhaps conclude that the SeptemTabernae here mentioned were on the 8. side of theforum. The argentariae afterwards called Novaewere undoubtedly on the N. side, and, for the reasonjust given, they perhaps lay to the K. of the curia,as the fire seems to have spread to the eastward.It was on the N. side that the greatest damage wasdone, as the tire here spread to the Lautumiue andf orum Piseatorium. The Septem Tabernae appearto have been the property of the state, as they wererebuilt by the censors at the public expense, togetherwith tin' fish-market and Atrium Regium (" Loca-verunt inde refieienda quae circa forum incendioconsumpta erant, septan, tabernas, marellum, atriumregitim," Id xxvii. 11). This passage would seemto >how that the reading quintptc (tabernae) in thatpreviously cited is corrupt. Muretus has observedthat one codex has "quae postea rrf.,*1 which inother* was contracted into v., and thus taken for anumeral, (Becker, Handb. p. 297, notes). Hencewe may infer that the Veteres Tabernae on the S.side ot the forum were seven in number, and fromthe word po.-tett applied to them, whilst nunc isus»'d of the Novae, it might perhaps be inferredthat the distinctive appellation of Veteres did notconic into use till after this accident. It also appears from this passage, that there wereno basiliiae at Home at this period. It was notlong afterwards, however, namely it. c. 184, thatthe first ofthe.se buildinjrs was founded by M. Por-cius Cato in his censorship, and called after himB vsii.ica PoticiA. In order to procure the requisiteground, Cato purchased the houses of Maenius andI it ins in the Lautumiae, and four tabernae, (Liv.xxxix 44.) Hence we may infer that the Laulu-niiae lay close at the back of the forum; which alsoappears from the circumstance that Maenius. when1"' sold his house, reserved for himself one of itscolumns, with a balcony on the top, in order that heand his posterity might lie able to view from it thegladiatorial shows on the for am.

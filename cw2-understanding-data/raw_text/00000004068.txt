V. the machines was very hot, while the one side tried hard toset them on fire, and the other side to prevent it; on bothsides there was a confused cry made, and many of those inthe fore-front of the battle were slain. However, the Jewswere now too hard for the Romans, by the furious assaultsthey made like madmen; and the fire caught hold of theworks, and both all those works and the engines themselveshad been in danger of being burnt, had not many of thoseselect soldiers that came from Alexandria opposed themselvesto prevent it, and had they not behaved themselves withgreater courage than they themselves supposed they couldhave done: for they outdid those in this fight that had greaterreputation than themselves before. This was the state ofthings till Caear took the stoutest of his horsemen, and at­tacked the enemy, when he himself slew twelve of those thatwere in the fore-front of the Jews; which death of these men,when the rest of the multitude saw, they gave way, and hepursued them, and drove them all into the city, and savedthe works from the fire. Now it happened at this fight thata certain Jew was taken alive, who, by Titus's order, wascrucified before the wall, to see whether the rest of themwould be affrighted, and abate of their obstinacy. But afterthe Jews were retired, John, who was commander of theIdumeans, and was talking to a certain soldier of his acquaint­ance beforo tho wall, was wounded by a dart shot at him byan Arabian, and died immediately, leaving the greatest la­mentation to the Jews and sorrow to the seditious: for howas a man of great eminence both for his actions and hisconduct also.

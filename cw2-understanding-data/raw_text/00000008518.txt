Thus, itis mentioned in the war of b. c. 406 as one of theirprincipal naval stations (Diod. xiii. 88); and againin B.C. 397 it was one of the lew cities which re­mained faithful to the Carthaginians at the time ofthe siege of Motya, (Id. xiv. 48.) In b. <■. 383 itis u-jain noticed as the head-quarters of the Cartha­ginians in the island (Id. xv. 17); and it is certainthat it was never taken, either by Dionysius or bythe still more powerful Agathoclos. Hut in u. c.276, Pyrrhus, after having subdued all the othercities in Sicily held by the Carthaginians, exceptLilybaeum and Panormus, attacked and made him­self master of the latter city also. (Id. xxii. 10. p.49S.) It, however, soon fell again into the bands ofthe Carthaginians, who held it at the outbreak of theFirst Punic War. it. c. 264. It was at this time themost important city of their dominions in the island,and generally made the head-quarters both of theirarmies and fleets; hut was nevertheless taken withhut little difficulty by the Roman consuls AtiliusCalat'inus and Cn. Cornelius Scipio in b. c. 254.(Polyb. i. 21, 24, 38; Zonar. viii. 14; Diod. xxiii.18 p. 505.) After this it became one of the prin­cipal naval stations of the Romans throughout theremainder of the war, and for the same reason be­came a point of the utmost importance for their stra­tegic operations. (Diod. xxiii. 19, 2l,xxiv. 1; Polyb.i. 39, 55, &c.) It was immediately under the wallsid' Panormus that the Carthaginians under Hasdrubalwere defeated by L. Caccilius Metellus in B. t\ 250,in one of the most decisive battles of the whole war.(Polyb. i. 40; Zonar. viii. 14; Oros. iv. 9.) It washere also that the Romans had to maintain a long-continued struggle with Hamilcnr Barca, who hadseized on the remarkable isolated mountain calledKrcta, forming a kind of natural fortress only abouta mile and a half from Panormus [Ercta], andsucceeded in maintaining himself there for the ^p.^ccof three years, notwithstanding all the efforts of theRomans to dislodge him. They were in consequencecompelled to maintain an intrenched camp in frontof Panormus, at a distance of only five stadia fromthe foot of the mountain, throughout this protractedcontest. (Polyb. i. 5G, 57.) After the Roman conquest of Sicily, Panormusbecame a municipal town, but enjoyed a privilegedcondition, retaining its nominal freedom, and immu­nity from the ordinary burdens imposed on othertowns of the province. (Cic. Verr. iii. 6.) It wasin consequence a flourishing and populous town, andthe place where the courts of law were held for thewhole surrounding district. (Id. ib. ii. 26, v. 7.)Cicero notices it at this time as one of the principalmaritime and commercial citi<-s of the island. (/&.v. 27.) In the settlement of the affairs of Sicilywhich seems to have followed the war with S-xtnsPompeius, Panormus lost its liberty, but received aRoman colony (Strab. vi. p. 272), whence we findit bearing in in;>eriptions the title of" Colonia Au­gusta Panormitanorum." It would seem from DionCassius that it received this colony in b. c. 20; andcoins, as well as the testimony ol Strabo, prove in­contestable' that it became a colony under Augustus.It is strange, therefore, that Pliny, who notices allthe other colonies founded by that emperor inSicily, has omitted all mention of Panormus as such,and rank-* it merely as an ordinary municipal town.(Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Dion Cass. liv. 7; Kckhel, vol.i. p. 232; Orell, fnscr. 948, 3760.) It Nub^e-quently received an accession of military colonists under Vespasian, and a<;ain under Hainan.Cohm. p. 211; Zumpt, de Coltm. p. 410.) N.im-rous inscriptions prove that it continued tf> v.r illnurishing provincial town throughout theof the Roman empire ; and its name is rejrtWmentioned in the Itineraries (/tin. Ant pp. Sfl .j Tab.

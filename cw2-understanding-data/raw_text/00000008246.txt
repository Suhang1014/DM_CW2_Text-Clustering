TRASIMENUS LACls siderable town was situated on its sliore.-i: Perusia,from which it derives its modem name of tlie LogoHi Perugia, stands on a lofty hill alumt 10 miles tothe K. of it; Clnsium is .situated about 9 miles totli*; SW. and Cortona between 6 and 7 to the NW.The highroad from Arretium to Perusia followedthe northern shore of tlie lake for a considerabledistance. Tlie lake Trasimenus derives its chief celebrityfrom the great victory obtained upon its shores byHannibal over the Roman consul, C. Flaminius,it. c. 217, one of the greatest defeats sustained bythe Roman arms during the whole course ot theirhistory. The circumstances of this battle are moreclearly related and more readily understood withreference to the actual localities than those of anyof the other great battles of Hannibal The Car­thaginian general, after crossing the Apennines,and effecting his toilsome inarch through themarshes of Ktruria, had encamped in the neigh­bourhood of Faesuiae (Pol. iii. 80, S'2). Flamimuswas at this time posted with his army at Arretium,and Hannibal, whose object was to draw him intoa general battle, moved along the upper valley ofthe Arnus, and passing within a short distance ofthe consul's camp, advanced along the road towardsHome (i. e. by Perusia), laying waste the countryas he advanced. Flamimus on this hastily brokeup his camp, and followed the Carthaginian army.Hannibal had already passed the city of Cortona onhis lett, and was advancing along the K. shore ofthe lake, which lay on his right hand, when, learn­ing that Flaininius was following him, he deter­mined to halt and await his attack, taking advan­tage of the strong position which offered itself tohim. (Pol. iii. 82; Liv. xxii. 4.) The hills whichextend from Cortona to the lake, called by Livy theu inontes Cortonenses," and now known as the MonteGuakmdro, descend completely to the bank of thelake, or at least to the marshes that border it, at apoint near tlie NW. angle of the lake, now markedby a village and a. round tower called Boryhttto.This spur of the hills completely separates the basinof the lake from the plains below Cortona, and it isnot until after surmounting it that the traveller bythe modern road comes in sight of the lake, .is wellas of the small plain or valley, shut in between itsN. shore and the GuaUmdro, which was the actualscene of the catastrophe. "Arrived ut the highestpoint of the road, tlie traveller has a partial view ofthe fatal plain, which opens fully upon him as he de­scends the GuaUindro. He soon rinds himself in avale, enclosed to the loft, and in front, and behindhim by the Gualandro hills, bending round in asegment larger than a semicircle, and running downat each cud to the lake, which obliques to the riijhtand forms the chord of this mountain arc. Tlieposition cannot bo guessed at from the plains ofCortona, nor appears to be so completely enclosed,unless to one who is fairly within the* hills. Itthen indeed appears a place made as it were onpurpose lor a snare, 'locus intidiis natus.' (Liv.xxii. 4.) Borghttto is then found to stand in anarrow marshy pass close to the hill and to the lake,whilst there is no other outlet at the opposite turnof the mountains tban throuuh tlie little town ofPasttynano, which is pushed iuto the water by thefoot of a high rocky acclivity. There is a woodyeminence branching down from the mountains intothe upper end of the plain nearer to the site ofrassi'jnano, and ou this stands a village called Torre" (more properly Ttntrv).

X.] THE SULLAN CONSTITUTION. 365 volved on the two consuls the collective functions of the su- pratorianpreme magistracy, so there still devolved on them all those function*official duties for which distinct functionaries had not been by ^(on thelaw established. This latter course had been adopted with the s™1Ca°administration of justice in the capital, in which the consulsaccording to a rule inviolably adhered to might not interfere,and with the transmarine provinces then existing—Sicily, Sar­dinia, and the two Spains—in which, while the consul mightno doubt exercise his imperium, he did so only exceptionally.In the ordinary course of things, accordingly, the six fieldsof special jurisdiction—the two judicial appomtments in thecapital and the four transmarine provinces—were appor­tioned among the six praetors, while there devolved on thetwo consuls by virtue of their general powers the ma­nagement of the non-judicial business of the capital andthe military command in the continental possessions.Now as this general authority was doubly provided for, theone consul in reality remained at the disposal of the govern­ment, and in ordinary times accordingly those eight supremeannual magistrates fully, and in fact amply, sufficed. For ex­traordinary cases moreover power was reserved on the onehand to conjoin the non-military functions, and on theother hand to prolong the military powers beyond the term oftheir expiry (prorogare).

For thatcase on the contrary a remedy was provided by the rule thatthere was no interregnum in the military imperium, so that, al­though it had its legal term, it yet continued after the arrivalof that term de jure until a successor appeared and relievedhis predecessor of the command; or—which is the samething—the commanding consul or praetor after the expiry ofhis term of office, if a successor did not appear, might con­tinue to act and was bound to do so in the consul's orpraetor's stead. The influence of the senate on this ap­portionment of functions consisted in its having by use andwont the power of either giving effect to the ordinary rule,so that the six praetors allotted among themselves the sixspecial departments and the consuls managed the conti­nental non-judicial business, or prescribing some deviation f

Its Hebrew name, Tadnior, or Thad-mor, denotes, like its Greek one, a city of palms;and this appellation is preserved by the Arabs, whostill call it Tedmor. Tadmor was built, or moreprobably enlarged, by Solomon in the tenth centuryB. c. (1 Kins/8, ix. 18; 2 Chron. viii. 4), and itsidentity with Palmyra is shown in the passage ofJoseph us before cited. It \>> seated in a pleasantand fruitful oasis of the great Syrian desert, and iswell watered by several small streams; but the rivermentioned by Ptolemy is nowhere to be found. Itssituation is tine, under a ridge of hills towards theW., and a little above the level of an extensive plain,which it commands on the E. (Wood, Jiuins ofPtdmyra^ p. 5), at a distance of about 140 milesENE. of Damascus. It is not mentioned by Xeno-plion, who must have passed near it, nor in theaccounts of the conquests of Alexander the Great.The first historical notice that we find of it is inAppian, who tells us that M. Antony, under pretenceof punishing its equivocal conduct, but in reality toenrich his troops with the plunder of a thrivingcommercial city, directed his march towards it, butwas frustrated of his object by the inhabitantsremoving their goods to the other side of the Eu­phrates. (B. Civ. v. c. 9.) This account showsthat it must have been a town of considerable wealth;and indeed its advantageous situation must havelong rendered it an entrepot for the traffic betweenthe east and Damascus and the Phoenician cities onthe Mediterranean. Yet its name is not mentionedcither bv Strabo or Mela. Under the first Romanemperors it was an independent city; and its situationon the borders of the Koman and Parthian empiresgave it a political importance, which it teems tohave preserved by a well-judged course of policy,though naturally exposed to much danger in the |quarrels of two such formidable neighbours.

Thus Sicily even from theCarthaginian period formed a distinct customs-district, onthe frontier of which a tax of 5 per cent, on the value waslevied from all imports or exports ; thus on the frontiersof Asia there was levied in consequence of the Sempronianlaw (P. 115) a similar tax of 2-J per cent.; in like mannerthe province of Narbo, exclusively the domain of the Romancolony, was organized as a Roman customs-district.

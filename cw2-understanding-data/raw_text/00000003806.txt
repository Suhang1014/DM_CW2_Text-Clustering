V. think that the Romans would never venture to come into thocity any more; and that, if they kept within it themselves,they should not be any more conquered. For God had blindedtheir minds for the transgressions they had been guilty of,nor could they see how much greater forces the Romans hadthan those that were now expelled, no more than they coulddiscern how a famine was creeping upon them; for hithertothey had fed themselves out of tho public miseries, and drankthe blood of the city. But now poverty had for a long timeseized upon the better part, and a great many had alreadydied for want of necessaries ; although the seditious, indeed,supposed the destruction of the people to be an easement tothemselves, for they desired that none others might be preÂ­served but such as were against a peace with the Romans, andwere resolved to live in opposition to them; and they werepleased when the multitude of those of a contrary opinion wereconsumed, as being then freed from a heavy burden. Andthis was their disposition of mind with regard to those thatwere within the city, while they covered themselves with theirarmor, and prevented the Romans when they were trying toget into the city again, and made a wall of their own bodiesover against that part of tho wall that was cast down. Thusdid they valiantly defend themselves for three days; but onthe fourth day they could not support themselves against thevehement assaults of Titus, but were compelled by force to flywhither they had fled before ; so he quietly possessed himselfagain of that wall, and demolished it entirely. And when hehad put a garrison into the towers that were on the south partsof the city, he contrived how he might assault the third wall.

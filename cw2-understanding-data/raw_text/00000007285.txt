OCR Output THE LIFE OF -FLAVJDS JOSEFHUS. 197 persons before named gave their advice, that the city should thencontinue in their allegiance to the Romans, and to the king. ButPistus, who was guided by his son Justus, did not acquiesce inthat resolution ; otherwise he was himself naturally of a goodand virtuous character. But the second faction was composedof the most ignoble persons, and was determined for war. Butas for Justus, the son of Pistus, who was the head of the thirdfaction, although he pretended to be doubtful about going to war,yet was he really desirous of innovation, as supposing that heshould gain power to himself by the change of affairs. He there­fore came into the midst of them, and endeavoured to inform themultitude, That " the city Tiberias had ever been a city of" Galilee, and that in the days of Herod the tetrarch, who had" built it, it had obtained the principal place, and that he had or-" dered that the city Sepphoris should be subordinate to the city" Tiberias ; that they had not lost this pre-eminence even under."

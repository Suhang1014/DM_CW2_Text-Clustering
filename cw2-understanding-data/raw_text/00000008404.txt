On the western side of the townthere is a rapid torrent, impassable during the greaterpart of the winter, and which, rushim; down fromthe mountains, makes the city exceedingly strongand inaccessible, in consequence of the size of theravine which it lias gradually formed. On the east­ern side Hows the Krymanthus,a lar^e and impetuousriver, concerning which there are so many stories.As the western torrent joins the Krymanthus on thesouthern side of the city, its three sides are sur­rounded by rivers, and rendered secure in the mannerde«icribed. On the remaining hide towards the northa strong bill hangs over, surrounded by a wall, andserving the purjio.se of a well-placed citadel. Thetown itself also is provided with walls, remarkablefor their size and construction.'' (Polyb. iv. 70.)From this description it is evident that the Eryman-thus on the eastern side of the city is the river ofSupitfo; and that the western torrent, which we learnfrom l*au>anias (viii. 24. § 3) bore the name of Aro-anius, is the river of Ght rmotzt'ma. About 300 feetbelow the junction of these rivers the united streamis joined by a third, smaller than the other two,called the river of Lopts'i or Sk*ipi} which rises onthe frontiers of Cleitor, near Seirae. From thesethree rivers the place is now called Trtpotamo.The banks of the Krymanthus and the Aroantu^ areprecipitous, but not very high; and between themand the steep summit of the hill upon which thetown stood there is a small space of level or gently-rising ground. The summit is a sharp ridge, sendingforth two roots, one of which descends nearly to theiinqle of junction of the two streams, the otheralmost to the bank of the Krymanthus at the easternextremity of the city. (Leake, Mono, vol. ii.p. 242.) Philip, in Ids attack upon Psophis, crossed thebridge over the Krymanthus, which was probably inthe same position as the modern bridge, and thendrew up his men in the narrow space between theriver and the walls. While the Macedonians wereattempting to scale the walls in three separate parties,the Kleians made a sally from a gate in the up]»erpart of the town. They were, however, driven backby the Cretans in Philip's army, who followed thefugitives into the town. Kuripidas and the garrisonthen retreated into the citadel, and shortly afterwardssurrendered to Philip. (Polyb. iv. 71, 72.) Pausanias saw at Psophis a ruined temple ofAphro-dite Erycina, heroa of Proinuehus and Kchepliron,the tomb of Alcmaeon, and near the Krymanthus atemple sacred to that stream. (Pans. viii. 24. § 7.)Leake aho noticed a part of a theatre, not mentionedby Pausania*, on the side of the hill towards theAroanius. Nine hundred feet above the junction ofthe two rivers, and near the walls on the bank of theKrymanthus, Leake also found some remains of apublic building, 00 feet in length, below which thereis a source of water in the bank. lie conjecturesthat they may be the remains of the temple of Kry­manthus. Psophis was about 2 miles in circumference. Thetown-walls followed the crest, of the ridge to thenorthward and the bank above the two rivers on theopposite side ; and they are traceable nearly through­out the entire circuit of the place. On the north­eastern side of the town, which is the only part notprotected by the two rivers or by the precipices atthe back of the hill, there was a double inelosure.Leake could not trace the inclosure of the citadel.

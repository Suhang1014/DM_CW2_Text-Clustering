I.] THE TOWER OP ANTON IA. 289 this fall of their wall was unexpected by them, and they hadmade no provision in that case, yet did they pull up theircourage, because the tower of Antonia itself was still standing;as was the unexpected joy of the Romans at this fall of thewall soon quenched by the sight they had of another wall,which John and his party had built within it. However, theattack of this second wall appeared to be easier than that ofthe former, because it seemed a thing of greater facility to getup to it through the parts of the former wall that were nowthrown down.

I therefore think that such exhortationsought then only to be made use of when affairs are in a dan­gerous condition, and yet are worthy of being attempted byevery one themselves: accordingly, I am fully of the sameopinion with you, that it is a difficult task to go up this wall;but that it is proper for those that desire reputation for theirvalor to struggle with difficulties in such cases, will then ap­pear, when I have particularly showed that it is a brave thingto die with glory, and that the courage here necessary shallnot go unrewarded in those that first begin the attempt. Andlet my first argument to move you to it be taken from whatprobably some would think reasonable to dissuade you, I meanthe constancy and patience of these Jews, even under their

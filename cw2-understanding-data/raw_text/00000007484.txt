ANTIQJJITIES OF THE JEWS. 51 went up into the temple; he had also acclamations and praisesgiven him, which way foever he went, every one striving withthe rest who should appear to use the loudest acclamations. Sohe ascended an high elevation made for him, and took his seat,in a throne made of gold, and spake kindly to the multitude, anddeclared, " with what joy he received their acclamations, and" the marks of the good will they shewed to him ; and returned" them thanks that they did not remember the injuries his fa-'' ther had done them, to his disadvantage ; and promised them" he would endeavour not to be behindhand with them in re-" warding their alacrity in his service, after a suitable manner ;" but that he should abstain at present from the name of king," and that he should have the honour of that dignity, if Caesar" should confirm and settle that testament which his father had" made ; and that it was on this account, that when the army" would have put the diadem on him at Jericho, he would not«' accept of that honour, which is usually so much desired, be-" cause it was not yet evident that he who was to be principally" concerned in bestowing it, would give it him ; although, by" his acceptance of the government, he should not want the abi-" lity of rewarding their kindness to him ; and that it should be" his endeavour, as to all things wherein they were concerned," to prove in every respect better than his father." Where­upon the multitude, as it is usual with them, supposed that thefirst days of those that enter upon such governments, declare theintentions of those that accept them ; and so by how much Ar-chelaus spake the more gently and civilly to them, by so muchdid they more highly commend him, and made application tohim for the grant of what they desired. Some made a clamourthat he would ease them of some of their annual payments ; butothers desired him to release those that were put into prison byHerod, who were many, and had been put there at severaltimes; others of them required that he would take away thosetaxes which had been severely laid upon what was publicly soldand bought. So Archelaus contradicted them in nothing, sincehe pretended to do all things so as to get the good will of themultitude to him, as looking upon that good will to be a grcttStep towards his preservation of the government. Hereupon hewent and offered sacrifice to God, and then betook hiniielf to£east with his friends. C H A P,

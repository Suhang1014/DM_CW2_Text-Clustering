TAPROBAXE by the Aethiopians, and, after a time, with one othercompanion, placed in a boat and left to his fate.After a long voyage, he came to an island, rich inall kinds of natural productions and 5000 stadiaround (<TTpoyyv\r} p,ev vitapxovoT) Ty trx^part).lambulus stayed thrre seven years, and thence wentto Pali both m, where tie was well received by theking, who is said to have been <pi\4\\tjv (I)iad. ii. 55,&c). That the details of this voyage are fabulous noone can doubt, yet the narrative is probably foundedon tact, and points to an early intercourse between the■hares of Eastern Africa and India. The fullest and by far the most interesting accountof Ceylon, is that preserved by Cosmas Indicopteus-tes, which was published by Montfaucon {Coll.Nov. Pair. ii. p. 336). Cosmas, who flourished inthe reign of Justinian, about a.d. 535, states thatlie obtained his information from a Greek named So­natina, whom he met at Adulis. According to thiswriter, the Taprobane of the Greeks is the Sielediba ofthe Hindus, an island lying beyond the Pepper Coast,or Malabar, and having near it a great number ofsmall islands (i. e. the Maldives). He reckons itaboui 900 miles in length and breadth, a measurehe deduces from a native measure called Gaudia(still said to be known in the island, and the sameas the Tamil tialiguai, Vincent, ii. p. 506). Therewere, at the time he received his information, twokings in the island, one the possessor of the Hyacinth(1. e. ot the mountain districts which abound in pre­cious stones), and the other of the plain country andcoast, where in later times the Arabians, Portu­guese, Dutch, and English, have in succession esta­blished factories. A Christian church, he adds,was established there lmhT)ixQ\)VTwv Tltpowv Xpia-Tiafuf, with a priest and deacon ordained in Per­sia. There is no doubt that these were Nestorians,whose Catholicos resided at Ctesiphon, and who, onthe Malabar coast, are often called Christians of St.Thomas. He determines the position of Sielediba,by stating that it is as far from it to China, as fromthe Persian Gulf to the island (p. 138). Again,he says, which is less correct, that Sielediba is fivedays' sail from the continent ; and that on the con­tinent is a place named Marallo {Marawar .?), whichproduces the pearl oysters; and adds, that the kingof Ceylon sells elephants for their height; and thatin India elephants are trained for war, while inAfrica they are captured for their ivory. Horsesimported from Persia pay no tax. It is remark­able that this notice of the elephants is in strictaccordance with that of Aelian, who asserts thatthey were bred in Ceylon and transported inlarge native vessels to the opposite continent, andsold to the king of Calingae {Hist. An. xxvi.18). Pliny {I.e.), on the authority of Onesicri-tus, affirms that larger and more warlike elephantsare reared in this island than anywhere else in India,and that the hunting of them was a constant sport: andPtolemy places under the Alalca M. {Adams Peak)his 4\«pdvT<»)v vo,ualt in the exact position in whichthey were, till lately, most abundant (viL 4. § 8).Tin* testimony of all modern travellers on the subjectof the Ceylon elephant is, that those bearing greattusks, and therefore valuable for their ivory, are ex­tremely rare in the island.

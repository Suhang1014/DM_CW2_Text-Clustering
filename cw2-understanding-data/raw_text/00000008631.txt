The scholiast on Horace (Epod. i. 30)descrihes Cicero's as being "ad latera superiora" ofthe Tuscnlan hill; anil if this authority may bo re­lied on, it disposes of the claims of Grotta Ferrata.The plural " latera " also determines us in favour ofthe W. side of the town, or Villa RtifineWt, wherethe hill lias two ridges. At this spot some valuableremains were discovered in 1741, especially a beau­tiful mosaic, now in the Museo I'io Clementina.The villa belonged originally to Sulla (Plin. xxii. 6.s. C.). It was, as wc have said, close to that of Lu-cullus, from which, in neighbourly fashion, Cicerowas accustomed to fetch books with his own hand.(l)e Fin. iii. 2.) It was likewise near that of theconsul Gabinius (pra Dom. 24, post Red. 7), whichalso stood on the Tuscnlan hill (in Pis. 21), pro­bably on the site of the Villa Falcoriurt, In hisoration pro Sestio (43), Cicero says that his ownvilla was a mere cottage in comparison with that of ]Gabinius, though the latter, when tribune, had de­scribed it as u pictam," in order to excite envyagainst its owner. Vet from the particulars whichwe learn from Cicero himself, las retirement musthave been far from deficient in splendour. Themoney which he lavished on it and on his villa atPompeii brought him deeply into debt. (Ep. adAtt.ii. 1.) And in another letter (lb. iv. 2) he com­plains that the consuls valued that at Tusculum atonly quingentis mill thus, or between 4000/. and5000/. This would be indeed a very small sum,to judge by the description of it which we mayCollect from his own writings. Thus we learn thatil contained two gymnasia (Die. i. 5), an upper one(ailed Lyceum, in which, like Aristotle, he was ac­customed to walk and dispute in the morning (Tusc.Disp. ii. 3), and to which a library was attached(Oiv. ii. 3), and a lower one, with shady walks likePlato's garden, to which he gave the name of theAcademy. (Tusc. Disp. ii. 3.) The latter wasperhaps on the spot now occupied by the Casino ofthe Villa Rujindla. Both were adorned with beau­tiful statues in marble and bronze. (Fp. ad Ait i.1, 8, 9, 10.) The villa likewise contained a littleatrium (atriolum, lb. i. 10, ad Quint. Fr. iii. 1), asmall portico with exedria (ad Fam. vii. 23), abath (lb. xiv. 20), a covered promenade ("tecta am-hulatiuncula," adAtt. xiii. 29), and an horologium(ad Fam. xvi. 18). In the excavations made inthe time of Zuzzeri, a sun-dial was discovered here,and placed in the Collegia Romano. The villa, likethe town and neighbourhood, was supplied withwater by the Aqua Crabra. (De Leg. Ayr. iii. 31.)Hut of all this magnificence scarce a vestige re­in, tins, unless we may regard as such the ruins nowcalled Scuola di Cicerone, close to the ancient walls.These consist of a long corridor with eight chambers,forming apparently the ground floor of an upperbuilding, and it'they belonged to the villa they wereprobably granaries, as there is not the least trace ofdec'ration. We will now proceed to consider the remains atFrascati. Strabo (v. p. 239) indicates where weinu.-it look for Tusculum, when he describes it assituated on the high ridge connected with MountAlbanus, and serving to form with it the deep valleywhich stretches out towards Mount Algidus. Thisridge was known by the name of the TusculaniColics. We have already seen that Tusculum wascomposed of two distinct jiarts, the town itself andthcarxor citadel, which was isolated from it, and seated on a higher point; wo eknfed.bfaL^when the Aequi had pjew-tsk* of it, a teanarrated, they could descry the Ko™ in* *■filing out of the gates ot home (DkeaiaiIt was indeed on the very mit.tr [mckrfairid;:e, a point isolated by cliffs if gmt dm*and approachable only by a verr sleep wvi. k>cording to Sir W.

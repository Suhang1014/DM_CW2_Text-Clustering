OCR Output LYRBE. 231 LYSIMACHIA. extracted from Polybius, as well as from the Itine­raries, it would appear tliat Lyncestis comprehendedthat part of Upper Macedonia now called Filuvina,and all the S. part of the basin of the Ebigon,with its branches, the Bevus and Osphagls. Asil is stated that the first encampment of the Romanswas at Lracus on the river Bevos, and as Lyncusis described as a town by Stephanos B. (though hisdescription is evidently incorrect), it might be sup­posed that Hekacleia, the chief town of this district,was sometimes called Lyncus, and that the camp ofSulpicius, was at fleracleia itself. But though thewords '' ad Lyncum stativa posuit prope flumenBevum" (Liv. I. c.) seem to point to this identifi­cation, yet it is more likely that Lyncus is here usedas synonymous wiih Lyncestis, as in two other pas-»ajes of Livy (xxvi. 25, xxxii. 9), and in Thu-cydides (iv. 83, 124) and Plutarch. (Flamin. 4.) At or near lituiitza are the mineral acidulouswaters of Lyncestis, which were supposed by theancients to possess intoxicating qualities. (Ov.Mit. xv. 329; comp. Arist. Meteor, ii. 3; Theo-pump. ap. Plin. ii. 103, xxxi. 2, ap. Antig. Caryst.ISO, ap. Sotion. de Flum. p. 125; Vitruv. viii. 3;Sen. Uuatst. iVaf. iii. 20.) They were found byDr. Bruwu (Travels in Ilungaria, Macedonia, Tfies-saly, dt dr., Lond. 1673, p. 45) on the road fromFUvrina to Egri Budja. He calls the place Ec-asso Yerbeni; this, which sounds Wallachian, maypossibly be a corruption of the name of the Dercenior pass. (Leake, AoriAern Greece, vol. iii. pp.305—318.) [E. B. J.] LYRBE (AvpS-n: Eth. AvpStiTns), a town ofPiskiia, uienlioned by the poet Dionysius. Thereare coins of this place belonging to the reign ofAk-xander Severus, and it occurs among the epi­scopal towns of Pamphylia in the Not. Eccles. It isclearly the same as the Lyrope (At/fKiirjj) ofI't'Jemy, though he places the latter in CiliciaTracheia. (Dionys. Per. 858; Hierocl. p. 682;PloJ. v.5. § 9; Cramer, Asia Minor, vol.ii. p. 313.) LYRCE1A or LYRCEIUM (h Aopxeio, Paus.;AvfMHiov, Soph. ap. Strab. vi. p. 271 ;,in Strab. viii. p.376, AvKovpyiov is a false reading for fivpntiov, seeKramer's Strab. vol. ii. p. 186), a town intlieArgeia,distant 60 stadia from Argots, and 60 stadia from Or-neae, and situated on the road Climax, which can fromArgus in a north-westerlydirection along the bed of theluacbus. [AkooS, p. 201. j '1 lie town is said to liavebees originally called Lynceiu, and to have obtainedthis name from Lyuceus, who fled hither when allbis other brothers, the sons of Aegyptus, were mur-drred by the daughters of Danaus on their weddingnight. He gave intelligence of his safe arrival inthis place to his faithful wife Hypennnestra, byholding up a torch; and she in like manner informedLim of her safety by raising a torch from Larissa,the citadel 'if Argos. The name of the town wasafterwards changed into Lyrceia from Lyrcus, a sonof Abas. It was in ruins in the time of Pausanias.Its remains may still be seen on a small elevationen the left of the Inachus, at a little distance beyondblma, on the road to Argus. (Paus. ii 25. §§ 4,5;Apoliui. ii. 1. § 5 ; Strab. /. c.; Ross, Retten imJ'llupomtt, p. 138; Boblaye, Rccherches, cfc. p.45; Leake, Morea, vol. ii. p. 414; Curtius, JJeli>-pmmetns, vol. ii. p. 415.) LYRXAS. fLyiuiessus, 2.] LYRXE6SUS (\uprnoa6s: Eth. AupHjwiot orA»f»moj, Aeschyl. rers. 324). 1. A town oftenB-.uui.ced by Homer (//. ii. 690, xix. 60, xj. 92, 191), and described by Stephanus B. (s. v.) as oneof the eleven towns in Troas ; and Strabo (xiii. p.612) mentions that it was situated in the territoryof Thcbe, but that afterwards it belonged toAdramyttium. Pliny (v. 32) places it on theriver Evenus, near its sources. It was, like Thcbe,a deserted place as early as the time of Strabu.(Comp. Strab. xiii. p. 584; Diod. v. 49.) About4 miles from Karavdren, Sir C. Fellows (Journ.of an Exc. in Asia Minor, p. 39) found severalcolumns and old walls of good masonry; which hois inclined to regard as remnants of the ancient Ly r-nessus. 2. A place on the coast of Pamphylia, which wa_sreported to have been founded there by the TrojanCilicians, who transferred the name of the TrojanLyrnessus to this new settlement (Strab. xiv. 670.)The town is also mentioned by Pliny (v. 26), whoplaces it on the Catarrhactes, and by DionysiusPeriegctes (875). The Stadiasmus Maris Macini(§ 204) calls it Lyrnas, and, according to theFrench translators of Strabo (vol. iii. pt. 2. p. 363),its site is identical with the modem Ernatia. 3. An ancient name of the island of Tenedos.(Plin. v. 39.) [L. S.] LY'ROPE. [Lyrbe.] LY'SIAS (Aoffids: Eth. Awio%7s), a small townin Phrygia, between Synnada and Prymnessiis.(Strab. xii. p. 576; Plin. v. 29 ; Ptol. v. 2. § 23;Hierocl. p. G77.) No particulars are known aboutthe place, nor is its site ascertained, but we stillpossess coins of Lysias. (Eckhel, Doctr. Num. iii.p. 167.) [L. S.] LYSIMACHIA (Aucnuaxfa or Avaifxiy^tta).1. A small town in Mysia, mentioned only by Pliny(v. 22), in whose time it no longer existed. 2. An important town on the north-eastern ex­tremity of the Thracian Chersoncsus, not far fromthe Sinus Melas. It was built by Lysimachus inb. c. 309, when he was preparing for the laststruggle with his rivals; for the new city, beingsituated on the isthmus, commanded the road fromSestos to the north and the mainland of Thrace.In order to obtain inhabitants for his new city,Lysimachus destroyed the neighbouring town ofCardia, the birthplace of the historian Hieronymus.(Strab. ii. p. 134, vii. p. 331; Paus. i. 9. § 10; Diod.xx. 29; Polyb. v. 34; Tlin. II. N. iv. 18.) Ly.-i-marhus no doubt made Lysimachia the capital of hiskingdom, and it must have rapidly risen to greatsplendour and prosperity. After his death the cityfell under the dominion of Syria, and during thewars between Scleucus Callinicus and Ptolemy Euer-getes it passed from the hands of the Syrians intothose of the Egyptians. Whether these latter setthe town free, or whether it emancipated itself, isuncertain, at any rate it entered into the relation ofsympolity with the Aetolians. But as the Aetolianswere not able to afford it the necessary protection, itwas destroyed by the Thracians during the war ofthe Romans against Philip of Macedonia. Antiochusthe Great restored the place, collected the scatteredand enslaved inhabitants, and attracted colonistsfrom all parts by liberal promises. (Liv. xxxiii. 38,40; Diod. Exc. de Yirt. et lit. p. 574.) This resto­ration, however, appears to have been unsuccessful,and under the dominion of Rome it decayed moreand more. The last time the place is mentionedunder its ancient name, is in a passage of AmmianusMarcellinus (xxii. 8). The emperor Justinian re­stored it and surrounded it with strong fortifications <J4

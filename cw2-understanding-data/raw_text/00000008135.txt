MvySoves, Steph.P>.), a district of Macedonia, which comprehendedthe plains round Thossalonica, together with tlievalleys "f Klmili and Bvsikia, extending towardsthe E. as far as the Axius (Herod, vii. 123). andincluding the Lake Bolbe to the E. (Thuc. i. 58.)To the N. it was joined by Crcstonia, for the Eclu-dorus, which flowed into the gulf near the marshesof the Axius, had its sources in Crestonia (Herod,vii. 124). while the pass of Anion or Arethusa■was probably the boundary of Mygdonia towardsIiisaltia. The maritime part of Mygdonia formeda district called Amphaxitis, a distinction whichiirst occurs in Polybius (v. 98), who divides all thegreat plain at the head of the Thermaic gulf intoAnipiiaxitis and Bottiaea, and which is found threecenturies later in Ptolemy (iii. 13. § 36). Thelatter intr<>duces Amphaxitis twice under the sub­divisions of Macedonia,— in one instance placingunder that name the months of the Eehidorus andAxius, with Thessalouica as the only town, winchagrees with Polybius, and particularly with Strabo(vii. p. 330). In the other place, Ptolemy includesStagura and Arethusa in Ampi.axitis, which, it' ithe correct, would indicate that a portion of Ani­piiaxitis, very distant from the Axius, was separatedfrom the remainder by a part of Mygdonia; but asthis is improbable, the word is perhaps an error inthe text. The original inhabitants, the Mygdouians,were a tribe belonging to the great Thracian race,and were powerful enough to bequeath their nameto it, even after the Macedonian conquest. (Thuc.ii. 90.) The cities of this district were Tiikssa- LOXICA, SlNDTS, ClIALASTRA, AlTUS, StHKVSA, * issrs. Mkllisuhgis, Hkraclkumtes. Besidesthese, the following obscure towns occur in Ptolemy(/.<*.):—Chaetae, Moryllus, Antigoneia, Calindaea,lioerus. P)iy-ca,Trepillus,Oarabia,Xylop«jlis, Assorus,I-ete, I'hileros, As to the towns wliich occupied thefertile plain between Mt. Cissus and the Axius, theirpopulation was no doubt absorbed by Thessalonica, onits foundation by Cassander, and remains of them arenot likely to be found; nor are the ancient referencessufficient to indicate their sites. One of these wouldseem, from ancient inscriptions which were found atKhutrdt, to have stood in that position, and othersprobably occupied similar positions on the last fallsof the heights which extend nearly from Khnivtitto the Axius. One in particular is indicated bysome large "tumuli11 or barrows, situated at two-thirds of that distance, (Leake, Xorth. Greece,vol. iii. p. 448.) [E. B. J.] MVtiDO'NIA (MtrySoWo, Pint. Lucull. c. 32;Polyb. v. 31), a district in the NE. part of Mesopo­tamia, adjoining the country now called the Sinjnr.According to Strabo, the people who were namedMygdones came originally from Macedonia, and oc­cupied the district extending from Zeugma to Tha-psaeus (xvi. p. 747); as, however, he states in thesame place that Nit-ibis was called by the Mace­donians " Antiocbcia in Mygdonia," and places it inthe immediate neighbourhood of M. Masius, hewould appear to have thought that it was on theeastern side of Mesopotamia. Plutarch relates the.same st>>ry of the Greek name of Ni.-ibis (LucuH.c. 32). in Stcphnnus Byz. the name is writtenMux^octa, which is probably an error. In many<■(' the earlier editions of Xenophun, a people areBjKiken of who are called Mtiyonvioi; the later anilbetter editions read, however, Ma/oorioi, winch ismu.e probable (.l«u6. iv. 3. § 4).

Hence Tliueydides speaks of Himerauin his time the only Greek city on the X. c-.-a.--t ot :iwisland, omitting Mylae, because it was not an iDde-[icnJcnt city or stale. (Thuc. vi. G2.)

Mylae itself does not appear to have erWrisen to any great importance; and after ibe revola-tiou which changed the name of Xanele to that ofMessana, still continued in the same dependent re­lation to it as before.

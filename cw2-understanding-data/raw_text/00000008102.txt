But all this is very doubtful, asPliny, besides being very vague, may have blunderedhere as in other parts of his work; for, according tosome. Bergion seems to have been an ancient nameof Hibcrnia or Ireland (P.

[Mknai'M; Morini.] [G.L.] NK'RVIl (NtpoCtot, titpGioi), a nation of Belgiea,whose capital according' to Ptolemy (ii. 0. § II) wasBacacum (Hami). When Caesar was preparing(».c. 57) to march against the Belgian confederates,he was informed that the Nervii hatl promised toMipply 50,000 men for the general defen<*e, andthat they were considered the most savage of all theeon federates. (B. G. ii. 4.) The neighbours of theXtrvii on the south were the Arabiani. (B. G. iL15.) In Caesar's time the Nervii had not allowed** toerca tores" to come into their country; theywould not let wine be imported and other thingswhich encouraged luxury. When Caesar liadinarched for three days through their territory, helearned that he was not more than 10 Roman milesfrom the Sabis (Sambre), and the Nervii werewaiting for him on the oilier side with the Atrcliatesand Veromandui, their border jeople. Thus weascertain that the Atrcbatcs, whose chief town isArras, and the Veromandui, whose chief place wasSt. QpaUin, were also neighbours of the Nervii. The Nervii had no cavalry, «nd their country wastrade almost impenetrable to any attack from thecavalry of their neighbours by quickset hrdfeswhich a man could not get through, and ir«W*hardly sec through them. (J9.Gr.1i. 17.) On taabanks of the Sombre. Caesar had a desperate Efbtwith the Nervii, commanded by Boduognatas-During this invasion the old men, the women, aaichildren of the Nervii, were removed to the actuariesand marshes, somewhere near the coast. TheNervii lost a great number of men in this battle:"the nation and the name were nearly destroyed."(B. G. ii. 27.) Their "senatores" as Caesar callsthem, their chief men, were reduced from 600 tothree, and out of the 60,000 who were in the berththere were said to be only 500 left capable of bearinrarms. After this terrible slaughter the Nerrii na*again in arms against Caesar (b. c 54), when tfcryjoined the Kburones and others in the attack eaQuintus Ciceros camp. (B. G. v. 38.) Some at thacommentators have found a difficulty a boat the ap­pearance of the Nerrii again in B. c. 54, after havingbeen nearly destroyed in D.C 57. We most sap-pose that Caesar wrote of the events as they ot-curred, and that he did not alter what be badwritten. In b. c. 57 he suppled that he had de­stroyed most of the fighters of the Nerrii. In a. a54 he found that he was mistaken. In B-c. 53the Nervii were again preparing to give troobJe tsthe Roman governor; but he entered their coontryin the winter season, and before they hail time Urally or to escape, he took many prisoners, drove c£many head of cattle, and ravaged their land, and wcompelled them to come to terms. (B. C. vi. 2.)When the meeting of the Gallic states in b. c 53was settling the forces that each nation should •endto the relief of Alesia, the contingent of the Nervawas 5000 men. (fi. G. vii. 75.) Some of the nations between the .Sruv, the sea,and the Rhine, were Germans in Caesar's time, butthese Germans were invaders. The Nerrii (Tat.Germ. c. 28) claimed a Germanic origin, and tbrymay have been a German or a mixed German anaGallic race; but there is no evidence whith ransettle the question. Appian (de BelL (,'alL L 4)speaks of the Nervii as descendants of the Teti!cv*»and Cirabri; but this is worth very little. Apeaaahad pn»bahly no authority except Caesar, wbeca beused carelessly; and he may bare applied to theNervii what Caesar says of the origin of the A«io-atuci. (Ii. 67. ii. 29.) Strabo (p. 194> also asyithat the Nervii were a Germanic nation, but b* d<*»not even know the position of the Nerrii, and aomisplaces them. Caesar mentions some smaller tribe* a§ drp^ndv-n.on the Nen-ii (B. <#. v. Mt>) : these tribes were Great a.Levari, Pleumoxii, Geiduni, of all whom we ki*j*nothing. I'liny (it, 17) mentions in Belcica as mlanrfpeople, the Castologi (apparently a corrupted naw),Atrebatea, Nervii liberi, Veromandtu; an onVr Wenumeration which corres|*md?» with the r<*itr« ef*the Nenij between the At rebates and the Verotmdui; for the chief place of the At rebate* i» .4r»-o# <t*the Nervii Harai, and of the Veromandui SL (Jtmtm.[Augusta VrnoMANiHTOKiM.] As Pliny cmBathe Nervii liberi, we must suppose that in has l-ramthey were exempt from the payment of taaes to ti»Romsns, and retained their own internal c-otvrsvraent; probably in I'liny's time the Romans t*kl notyet fully reduced their country,

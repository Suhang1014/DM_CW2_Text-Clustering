Hereuponhe left one whose name was Lysias, who was in great reputewith him, governor of the kingdom, as far as the bounds ofEgypt, and of the lower Asia, and reaching from the river Eu­phrates, and committed to him a certain part of his forces, andof his elephants, and charged him to bring up his son Antiochuswith all possible care, until he came back; and that he shouldconquer Judea, and take its inhabitants for slaves, and utterlydestroy Jerusalem, and abolish the whole nation.

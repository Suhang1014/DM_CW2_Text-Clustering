T>UT now Pilate, the procurator of Judea, removed the-^ army from Cesarea to Jerusalem, to take their winter-quarters there, in order to abolish the Jewish laws. So he in­troduced Caesar's effigies, which were upon the ensigns, andbrought them into the city ; whereas our law forbids us the verymaking of images; on which account the former procuratorswere wont to make their entry into the city with such ensignsas had not those ornaments. Pilate was the first who broughtthose images to Jerusalem, and set them up there ; which wasdone without the knowledge of the people, because it was donein the night-time ; but as soon as they knew it, they came inmultitudes to Cesarea, and interceded with Pilate many days,that he would remove the images ; and when he would not granttheir requests, because it would tend to the injury of Caesar,while yet they persevered in their request, on the sixth day heordered his soldiers to have their weapons privately, while hecame and sat upon his judgement-seat; which seat was so prepa.red in the open place of the city, that it concealed the army thatlay ready to oppress them ; and when the Jews petitioned him.again, he gave a signal to the soldiers to encompass them round,and threatened that their punishment should be no less than im­mediate death, unless they would leave off disturbing him, andgo their ways home. But they threw themselves upon theground, and laid their necks bare, and said they would taketheir death very willingly, rather than the wisdom of their lawsshould be transgressed ; upon which Pilate was deeply affectedwith their firm resolution to keep their laws inviolable, and pre­sently commanded the images to be carried back from Jerusa­lem to Cesarea. 2.

How­ever, the Jews * were not pleased with what had been done a- bout * These Jews, as they are here called, whose blood Pilate shed on this occasion,may very well be those very Galilean Jews whose blood Pilate had mingled tuitbtheir sacrifices, Luke, xiii. i i.; these tumults being usually excited at some of theJews great festivals, when they slew abundance ot sacrifices, and the Galileansbeing commonly much more busy in such tumults than tho-e of Judea and Jerusa­lem, as we learn from the history of Archelaus, Antiq' B' XVII. ch. ix. sect. 3.and ch. x. sect. 2. 9. ; though, indeed, Josephus's present copies say not one won!«f tboir eightecn upon •whom the tower in Siham fell, anit situ' them, which the4"> verse of the same isth chapter of St Luke informs us of.

Its sitnntion is thus described:— "Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, untoMount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, thatis over against Jericho" (Deuf. xxxii. 49); "andMoses went up from the plains of Moab unto themountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgab, that is overagainst Jericho." We have here three names of themount, of which, however, Abarim may designatethe range or mountain region rising from the hightable-land of Moab (comp. Numbers, xxvii. 12,xxxiii. 47); while Pisgah is an appellative for a hill,—as it is rendered in our margin, wherever thename occurs in the text (Numb. xxi. 20; I)euUiii. 27, xxxiv. 1), and in several oriental versions(Lex. s. t?. rUDD^—Nebo the proper name of someone particular peak. This name is regarded by M.Quatremere as of Aramaic origin, identical with thatof the celebrated Chaldean divinity (Isaiah, xlvi. 1)so frequently compounded with the names of theirmost eminent kings, &c; and he discovers othernames of like origin in the same parts. (Memoiresur les Nabateengj p. 87.) It is placed by Eusebiuaand St. Jerome 6 miles west of Esbus (Heshbon),over against Jericho, on the road from Livias toEsbus, near to Mount Phogor [Peou]: it wasstill called by its ancient name (Onomast. s. vv.Nabau, Abarim). Dr. Robinson has truly remarkedthat over against Jericho u there is no peak or pointperceptibly higher than the rest; but all is appa­rently one level line of summit, without peaks orf aps." ...41 Seetzen, Burckhardt, and also Irby andMangles, have all found Mount Nebo in Jebel'Attd-rus, a high mountain south of the Zurka MainM(Arnon). This, however, is far south of the lati­tude of Jericho. (Bib. Res. vol. iii. pp. 306, 307). 2. A town of the tribe of Reuben, mentionedwith Heshbon, Elealeh, and others (Numb, xxxii.38); doubtless the site now marked by Neba in theJielLa, south of £s-Salt (Robinson, Bib. Res. vol.ii. p. 307, n. 1, vol. iii. appendix, p. 170), \. e. inthe same district with Httban and £l~*Al, themodern representatives of Heshbon and Elealeh.Whether this town was connected with the synony­mous mountain is very uncertain. 3.

The name wasevidently applied to a part of the range which com­mences near Cape Pclorus, and extends along thenorthern «ide of the island, the whole way to theneighbourhood of Panormus. Though broken intovarious mountain groups, there is no real interrup­tion in the chain throughout this extent, and thenames applied to different parts of it neem to havebeen employed (as usual in such case>) with muchvagueness. The part of the chain nearest to CapePclorus, was called Mons Neptunius, and therefore'the Mons Nebrodes must have been further to the

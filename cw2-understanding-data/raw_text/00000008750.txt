In someplaces the coast has been depressed by earthquakes,and at the mouth of the river Lycus are traces ofsubmerged quarries, (lierton, Tvpogr. de Tyr, p.54.) In like manner, the lake Cenderia, at thefoot of Cannel, in which Pliny (v. 17) describes theriver Belus as rising, has now disappeared; thoughShaw (Trav. ii. 33) mentions some pools near itssource. The geological structure of Phoenicia isrecent, and consists of chalk and sandstone, thehigher mountains being formed of the Jura lime­stone. The only metal found is iron, which occursin considerable quantities in the hills above Beirout.In the sandstone of the same district, bituminouswood and brown coal are found, but in smallquantities and impregnated with sulphur. III. Ethnological Relations of thePhoenicians.The Phoenicians were called by the GreeksQolvutts (Horn. Od. iv. 84; Herod, i. 1; Thucyd.L 8, &c), and by the Romans Phoenices (Cic. A. I'.ii. 41 ; Mela, i. 18 f Plin. v. 13, &c). They werea branch of the great Semitic or Aramaean race.The Scriptures give no intimation that they werenot indigenous; and when the Hebrews settled inCanaan, Sidon and Tyre were already flourishingcities. {Josh. xix. 28, 29.) By classing, however,the Phoenicians, ur Canaanites, among the descend­ants of Ham (Genesis, x. 15), the Scriptures implyan immigration. The reason of this classification,was probably their colour, the darkness of their com­plexion indicating a southern origin; yet theirLwguage, a safer criterion, marks them, as we havesaid, fur a Semitic race. This, though not strictlyidentical with the Hebrew, was the nearest allied tcit of all the Semitic tongues. St Jerome (Comm. inJer. xxv. 21) and St Augustine (Tract. 15 iaEvang. Joan.) testify that the Punic languageresembled the Hebrew. The same affinity is ob­servable in Punic words preserved in Greek andRoman writers; as in the Voenulus of Plant us,especially since the improvement of the text by thecollation of Mai. The similarity is also evinced bybilingual inscriptions discovered at Athens, wheremany Phoenicians were settled, as will be related inthe sequel. But perhaps one of the most re­markable proofs is tlie inscription on the Cartha­ginian tablet discovered at A/arseiHes in 1845. ofwhich 74 words, out of 94, occur in the OldTestament. Profane writers describe the Phoenicians as im­migrants from the borders of the Persian Gulf.Thus Herodotus (i. 1, vii. 89) asserts that theyoriginally dwelt on the Erythraean sea; an appella­tion which, in his language, as well as in that ofother ancient writers, embraces not only the presentRed Sea, but also the Persian Gulf and lndiunOcean. To the same purpose is the testimony ofStiabo (xvi. p. 766), who adds that there were inthe Persian Gulf two islands, Tyr us and Aradus,the inhabitants of which had temples resemblingthose of the Phoenicians, and who claimed the like-named inlands on the coast of the Mediterranean astheir colonies. Heeren (Researches, vol. ii. p. 56,Eng. trans.), who admits that traces of PhoenicianI workmanship and buildings have lately been dis-| covered in these islands, reverses the parentngf, and

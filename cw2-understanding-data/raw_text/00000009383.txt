OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 05 at Oreum, so easily obtained, proceeded with his vic­torious fleet to Chalcis, where the issue by uo meansanswered his expectations. The sea, from being prettywide at each side, is here contracted into a strait sovery narrow, that at first view the whole appears liketwo harbors facing the two entrances of the Euripus.A more dangerous station for a fleet can hardly befound ; for besides that the winds rush down suddenly,and with great fury, from the high mountains on eachside, the strait itself of the Euripus does not ebb andflow seven times a day at stated hours, as report says;but the current, changing irregularly, like the wind,from one point to another, is hurried along like a tor­rent tumbling from a steep mountain; so that, night orday, ships can never lie quiet.

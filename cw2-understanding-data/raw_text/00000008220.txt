A pestilencebroke out in the Carthaginian camp, from whichthey sustained very heavy losses, and Dionysius tookadvantage of their enfeebled state to make a generalattack on their camp both by sea and land. Theposition occupied by the Carthaginians was verymuch the same as that which had been held by theAthenians: they occupied the headland of Plemmy-riuui, nn which they had erected a fort, while theyhad also fortified the Olympieum, or Polichne, andconstructed a third fort close to the edge of theGreat Harbour for the protection of their fleet, whichlay within the inner bay or harbour of Dascon. ButI)iony>ius, by a sudden attack from the land side,carried both the last forts, and at the same time suc­ceeded in burning a great part of the Carthaginianfleet, so that Hiinilco was compelled to abandon theenterprise, and by a secret capitulation secured asafe retreat for himself and the native Carthaginiansin his army, abandoning his allies and mercenariesto their fate. (Diod. xiv. 62, 63, 70—75.) The defeat of the Carthaginian armament leftDionysius undisputed master of Syracuse, while thatcity held as unquestioned a pre-eminence over theother cities of Sicily; and it is probable that the cityit>elf continued to increase in extent and population.The impregnable citadel in the island of Ortygiaconstructed by the elder Dionysius continued to bethe bulwark of his power, as well as that of his sonand successor. Even when the citizens, in B. c. 357,opened their gates to Dion, who made a triumphalentry into Achradina, and made himself master withlittle dith'culty of the fort on the summit of Epipolae,the islanil still held out, and Dion was compelled ton\v,rt to a bhttjkadc, having erected a line or wall ofcontravallation across from the lesser port to thegreater, so as effectually to cut off the garrison fromail communication with the interior. (Plat Dion,2!>; Diod. xvi 12.) It was not till after the block­ade had been continued for above a year that Apollo-crates was compelled by scarcity of provisions tosurrender this stronghold, and Dion thus becamecomplete master of Syracuse, n. c. 356. But thatevent ilid not, as had been expected, restore libertyto Syracuse, and tlie island citadel still remainedthe stronghold of 1 tie despots who successively ruledover the city. When at length Tiuioleon lauded inSicily (b.c. 344) Ortygia was once more in thepossession of Dionysius, while the rest of the citywas in the hands of Hicetas, who was supported bya Carthaginian ileet and army, with which he closelyblockaded the island fortress. But the arrival ofTiinoleon quickly changed the face of affairs: Or­tygia was voluntarily surrendered to him by Dio­nysius; and Neon, whom he left there as commanderof the parrison, by a sudden sally made himselfmaster of Achradina also. Soon alter Tiuioleon car­ried the heights of Epipolae by assault, and thusfound himself master of the whole oi Syracuse. Oneof the first measures he took after his success was todemolish the fortress erected by Dionysius withinthe Island, as well as the palace of the despothimself, and the splendid monument that had beencreeled to him by his son and successor. On thesite were erected the new courts of justice. (PlutTimol. 22.) Syracuse had suffered severely from the Jong j period of civil dissensions and almost rw.rt»Lt'a-tilities which had preceded its liberatiir. bj T»-leon ; and one of the first cares of its deliverer t«to recruit its exhausted population, not oai* re­calling from all quarters tlie fugitive or eiurtaL-zens, but by summoning from Corinth iaa <tsrparts of Greece a laree body of new colonist*,was the success of his invitation that *r arethe total number of immigrants (inclui:nr of crtmthe restored exiles) amounted to not less tM60,000.

The shell ofthe true laud-tortoise was found :it Plolemais: it isdescribed by Ajatharehides(ap,Geogr. J/t/wr.p. 40,Hudson; Pertpl. Mar. Erutkr. p. 17) as coveredwith small lozenge-»haj>ed plates, of the whitenessof the pearl -oyster. To ancient geographers theposition of Ptolemais was of great importance, beingone of the points from which their computationsof latitude were made. Modem geographers, how­ever, are not agreed as to the degree in which itshould he placed, some identifying it with Has-AfftL:, opposite the island of Welh-slru, while others(Vincent, Voyage of Xearckus, vol. ii. p. 92) pre­fer a more southerly site, near the port of Mirza-Mombarrik.

It can hardlybe regarded, however, as an Aegyptian city, itspopulation and civil institutions being almost exclu­sively Greek, and its importance derived entirelyfrom the favour of the Ptolemies.

D.] PTOLK.MA'IS (riToAp/iais), a small town on thecoast of Pamphylia, between the river Midas and thetown of Coracesium, is mentioned only by Strabo (xiv.p. GOT). Leake (Asia Minor, p. 197) conjecturesthat Ptolernais did not stand upon the coast, as it isnot mentioned in the Stadiasmus, but occupied per-haps the situation of the modern town of Alum,where is a river, and upon its banks a steep hillcrowned with a Turkish castle.

In following this road Ad Publicanos comesafter Mantala [Mantala], and its position is atthe commencement of the territory of the Centroncsor La Tarentaise. Weaseling observes that thename Ad Publicanos indicates a toll place at abridge. [Pons AkrahiisJ. D'Anville supposesthat Ad Publicanos was at the point where \\wt Arli,a tributary of the here, is crossed, near which therewas an ancient Hospitiuiu or Stabulum, as it wascalled, Mich as we Hnd on several Roman roads.This place is now called UHopital de Confans, andis near the junction of the Arli and the fahre. AdPublicanos was probably on the boundary of theAliobroges and Centrones, where some dues wouldbe paid. These dues or customs were establishedin a period of Gallic history even anterior to the1 Ionian conquest. (Stnib. iv. p. 190.) Gallia wasloaded with these imposts, which continued to thetime of the French Revolution of 1789. The dis­tance between Mantala and Ad Publicanos is markedxvi. in the [tins., which does not agree with the sitefixed by D'Anville.

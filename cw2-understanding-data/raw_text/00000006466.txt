In this fame winter, the Olynthians, after a suddenassault, took Mecyberne, which was garrisoned by A-thenians.., After the former proceedings,—for conferences werestill continued between the Athenians and Lacedæmo­nians about those places they held from one another, —the Lacedæmonians, conceiving some hope that, if theAthenians could recover Panactum from the Bœotians,they also might regain Pyius, addressed themselves insolemn embassy to the Bœotians, and importuned themto deliver up Panactum and the Athenian prisoners,that they in return might get Pylus from them. Butthe Bœotians persisted in a resusal, unless they would makea separate alliance with them, as they had done with theAthenians. Upon this the Lacedæmonians, thoughconvinced that such a step would be injustice to the A-thenians,— since it had been stipulated that, " without"joint consent, they should neither make peace nor** war," — yet, bent on the recovery of Panactum, thatthey might exchange it for Pylus, the party at the fametime amongst them, who were meditating a fresh rupture,inclining to the Bœotian interest, made the requisite alli­ance in the very close of this winter on the approach ofspring. The consequence was, that Panactum was im­mediately levelled with the ground; and the eleventhyear of the war was brought to a conclusion. _ .

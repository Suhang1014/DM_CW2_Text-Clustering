The Royal Coun-srllfH-s, who presided over the administration of jus­tice (Strab. L c), and kept the archives of the realm. it was not permitted for intermarriages to takejlice between any of these classes, nor for any one toperform the office allotted to another, except in the caseof the first caste (called also that of the $>iAiwo(pof)(to which class a man might be raised from any of thefather classes. (Strab. I.e.; Arrian, Ind. c. 12; Diod.ii. 41; Plin. vi. 19. s. 22.) We may remark that theni-.*Jern writers on India recognise only four castes,called respectively Brahman*, Kshatryas, Vaisyas,ami Sudmsr — a division which Heeren has suggested(we think without sufficient evidence) to indicate theremains of distinct races. (AtiaL Nat. vol. ii. p. 220.) The lowest of the people (now called Pariahs), asbelonging to none of the above castes, are nowheredbtinctly mentioned by ancient writers (but cf. Strab.xv. p 709; Diod. ii. 29; Arrian,Ind. c. 10). The general description of the Indians, drawn fromMegaAthenes and others who had lived with them, isvery pleasing. Theft is said to have been unknown,so itiat houses could be left unfastened. (Strab. xv.ju 709.) No Indian was known to speak falsehood.(.Strab. L e.; Arrian, Ind. c. 12.) They were ex­tremely temperate, abstaining wholly from wine(Strab. /. c),—their hatred of drunkenness being sopreat that any girl of the harem, who should seethe king drunk, was at liberty to kill him. (Strab.xv. p. 710.) ilo class eat meat (Herod, iii. 100),tbeir chief sustenance being rice, which affordedthem also a strong drink, i. e. arrak. (Strab. xv.p. G94.) Hence an especial freedom from diseases,and lone lives; though maturity was early developed,especially in the female sex, girls of seven years oldhrin;; deemed marriageable. (Strab. xv. pp. 701—706; Arrian, Jnd. 9.) The women are said to havebeen remarkable for their chastity, it being impas­sible to tempt them with any smaller gifts than thatof an elephant (Arrian, Ind. c. 17), which was notconsiderwl discreditable by their countrymen; andthe usual custom of marriage was for the father totake his daughters and to give them in marriage totb- youths who had distinguished themselves mostin gymnastic exercises. (Arrian, L c.; Strab. xv.ft 717.) To strangers they ever showed the utmosthospitality. (Diod. ii. 42.) As warriors they werenotorious (Arrian, Ind. c. 9; Exped. Alex. v. 4;Pint. Alex. c. 59, 63): the weapons of the foot-aoWiers being bows and arrows, and a great two-handed sword ; and of the cavalry, a javelin and around shield (Arrian, Ind. c. 16; Strab. xv. p. 717;Curt. viii. 9.) In the Panjdb, it is said that theMacedonians encountered poisoned arrows. (Diod.srii. 103.) Manly exercises of all kinds were invogue among them. The chase was the peculiarprivilege of royalty (Strab. xv. pp. 709—712 ; Ctes.Ind. 14; Curt. viii. 9, seq.); gymnastics, music, anddancing, of the rest of the people (Strab. xv. p. 709;A-riaa, Exp. Alex. vi. 3); and juggling and slightof hand wrre then, as now, among their chief amuse­ments. (Aelian, viii. 7; Juven. vi. 582.) Theirusual dress befitted their hot climate, and was ofwhite Snen (Philost. Vit. A poll. ii. 9) or of cotton-stuff (Strab. xv. p. 719; Arrian, Ind. c. 16); theirbead* and shoulders partially covered (Arriau, /. c;Curt viii 9, 15) or shaded from the sun by um-DRiks (Arrian, L c.); with shoes of white leather,with very thick and many-coloured soles. (Arrian,£ t) Gold and ivory rings and ear-rings were in common use; and they were wont to dye their beards,not only black and white, but also red and green.(Arrian, /. c.) In general form of body, they werethin and elegantly made, with great litheness (Ar­rian, Ind. c. 17; Strab. ii. p. 103, xv. p. 695), butwere larger than other Asiatics. (Arrian, Exped.Alex. v. 4; Plin. vii. 2.) Some peculiar customs they had, which have lastedto thepresent day, such as self-immolation by water orfire, and throwing themselves from precipices (Strab.xv. pp.716, 718; Curt. viii.9; Arrinn,Exped. Alex.vii. 5; Lucan. iii. 42; Plin.vi. 19.8.20), and the burn­ing of the widow (suttee); not, indeed, agreeably toany fixed law, but rather according tocustom. (Strab.xv. pp. 699—714: Diod. xvii. 91, xix. 33; Cic.Tusc. Disp. v. 27.) For writing materials theyused the bark of trees (Strab. xv. p. 717; Curt. ix.15), probably much as the modem Cinghalese usethe leaf of the palm. Their houses were generallybuilt of wood or of the bamboo-cane; but in the coldmountain districts, of clay. (Arrian, Ind. c. 10.)It is a remarkable proof of the extent to whichcivilisation had been carried in ancient India, thatthere were, throughout great part of the country,high roads, with stones set up (answering to ourmilestones), on which were inscribed the name ofthe place and the distance to the next station.(Strab. xv. pp.689—708; Arrian, Ind. c. 3.) [V.] IN'DICUS OCEANUS (o 'Irtutto dtfcortfr,Agath, it. 14; to *\vhiK\iv iriKayos, Ptol. vii. 1. § 5).The Indian Ocean of the ancients may be consideredgenerally as that great sea which washed the wholeof the southern portion of India, extending from theparallel of longitude of the mouths of the Indus tothe shores of the Chersonesus Aurea. It seems, in­deed, to have been held by them as part, however, ofa yet greater extent of water, the limits of whichwere undefined, at least to the southwards, and towhich they gave the generic name of the SouthernSea. Thus Herodotus speaks of tj vorin SdAaaaain this sense (iv. 37), as does also Strabo (ii. p. 121);Diodorus calls it y Kara fMawpGpiai' u>K(cu>6s (iii38), while the Erythraean sea, taken in its mostextended meaning, doubtless conveyed the samesense. (Herod, ii. 102, iv. 37; compared with Strab.i. p. 33.) Ptolemy gives the distances across thissea as stated by seafaring men; at the same time heguards against their over-statements, by recordinghis opinion in favour of no more than one-third oftheir measurements: this space he calls 8670 stadia(i. 13. § 7). The distance along its shores, follow­ing the indentations of the coast-line, he estimates,on the same authority, at 19,000 stadia. It isevident, however, that Ptolemy himself had no clearidea of the real form of the Indian Ocean, and thathe inclined to the opinion of Hipparchus, Polybius,and Marinus of Tyre, that it was a vast inland sea,the southern portion of it being bounded by the slmrcsof an unknown land which he supposed to connect Cut -tigara in the Chersonesus Aurea with the promontoryof Prasum (now Cape Delgado) in Africa (comp. iv.9. §§ 1,3, vii. 3. §§ 1,3, 6). The origin of this errorit is not easy now to ascertain, but it seems to havebeen connected with one which is found in the his­torians of Alexander's expedition, according to whichthere was aconnection between thelndusand the Nile,so that the sources of the Acesines (Chendb) wereconfounded with those of the Nile. (Arnan, vi. 1.)Strabo, indeed, appears to have had some leaning toa similar view, in that he connected the Erythraeanwith the Atlantic sea (ii. p. 130); which was also £2

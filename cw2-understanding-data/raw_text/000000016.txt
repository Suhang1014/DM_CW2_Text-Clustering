Marius the,younger took to Praeneste 13,000 lbs. weight; the same sum wasbrought back to Rome by Sylla, at his triumph, together with6,000 lbs. weight of silver. The day before he had conveyed toRome 15,000 lbs. weight of gold, together with 115,000 lbs.weight of silver, being the produce of all his other victories. 6. OF THE EIGHTS ATTACHED TO GOLD EINGS. It was not until the time of Cn. Flavius, the son of Annius,that rings became more generally used. For he, having publishedthe calendar, which the people had been perpetually requestinga few of the chief men to do,1 obtained so great a degree of favourwith the lower classes, that although he was no more than the sonof a freedman, and had himself been the secretary of AppiusCaecus (by whom he was encouraged to undertake the business,being guided by his sagacity, and to publish the result) he wascreated curule jEdile, together with L.

Livy, in his account of this transaction,says, "Plerique nobilium annulos aureos et phaleras deponerent," lib. ix.cap. 46; thus denoting the "phalerse'' as something different from rings.

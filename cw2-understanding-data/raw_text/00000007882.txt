A place in Dacia, apparently in the neighbour­hood of Klausenlun/. (Ptol. iii. 8. § 7.) [T. II. I).] ULTERIOR PORTUS. [Itr-s Poktus.] ULUBRAE {Kth. Ulubren^is), a small town ofLatium on the borders of the Pontine Marshes. Itis not mentioned in history previous to the establish­ment of the Roman domiuion, but is noticed repeat­edly by Latin writers of the best period, thoughalways as a poor and decayed town, a condition whichappears to have resulted from its marshy and un­healthy position. Hence Cicero jestingly terms itscitizens little fro^s (ranunculi, Ep. adFam. vii. 18),and both Horace and Juvenal select it as an almostproverbial example of a deserted and melancholyplace. (Hor. Ep. i. 11. 30 ; Jut. x. 101.) Still itappears from the expressions of the latter, that itstill retained the rank of a municipal town, and hadits own local magistrates ; and in accordance withthis, we find the Ulubrenses enumerated by Plinya mom; the municipal towns of the First Region. (Plin.iii. 5. s. 9.) Tlie same thing is attested by inscrip­tions (Orell. luscr. 121—123). and the discovery ofthese at the place now called C'uterna, about eichtmiles from Vtlletri, and 35 from Koine, immediatelyat the entrance of the Pontine Marshes, loaves nodoubt that Ulubrae was situated somewhere inthat neighbourhood. But the village of Cis-terna (called in the middle a^es Cisterua Neronis),does not appear to occupy an ancient site, and theexact po>iti«>n i>f Ulubrae is still undetermined.(Nibby, Dintomi di Kama, vol. i. p. 463.)

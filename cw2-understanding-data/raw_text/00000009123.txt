NABATAEI. habited the land of Edom, commonly known nsIdumaen, and intimate that there was no connectionwhatever lielween the Idumaeans ot' I'etra in theAugustine period, and the children of Esau ; theywere, in fact, Nabatacans, and therefore, accordingto Joseph uh and other ancient authorities, IshmaeliteArabs. How or when they had dispossessed theEdomites dues not ap|>ear in history, nor what hadheroine uf the reninant of the Edomites. (Hubirw.n,I'/ih. U'-s. vol. ii. pp. 5"j9.) But while Judas Maeeahaeus was on terms of friendship with theNabataei, he was carrying on a war <>f extcrniinationagainst the Edomites. (Joseph. Ant. xii 8. § 1;1 Marcttb. v. 3.) It is worthy of remark, however,that tin- Idumaeans with whom Hyrcauus was inalliance, over whom Arct.is reigned, and from whomHerod way sprung, are expressly said to be Naba-taeans (Ant. xiv. 2. § 3, 3. 4), whose alli­ ance was refused by l'oinpoy, on account of theirinaptitude for war. And this identity is furtherproved by Strabo, who writes that the Idumaeans andtlie lake (Aspiialtides) wcupy tlie extreme west ( ?)corner of Judaea :—"These Idumaeans an; Na-bataeans ; but being expelled thence in a sedition,they witlidrew to the Jews and embraced their ens.totns." (xvi. p. TOO.) This recognition of theNnhataean origin of the later Idumaeans, prove*that tin' name is to be regarded as a geographyal,rather than as a genealogical designation. Pliny(vi. 32) throws little li<j.ht upon the subject,merely making the Nabataei contiguous to theScenite Aral>s, with whom tliey were more probablyidentical, and stating that the ancients had placedtlie Thimanaei next to them (i. e. on the E.); intlie place of whom he names several other tribes, asthe Tavcni, Suelleni, Arraeeni, &c. (/hit/.) But thestatement of Josephus that the Nabataei extendedfrom the Euphrates to the Red Sea, is confirmed bythe fact that tlie name is still to he found in boththose regions. Thus the name Nabnt is applied toa marshy district, described by Golius as partof the " palustria Chaldaeae," between Was it h amiBasra, which was called " paludes Nabathaeorum,"(Golius, cited by Forbter, tin*}, of Arabia, vol, i.p. "214 n.*), while at the other extremity the nameNabni is given to a town two days beyond (i. e.south) of El-lliinra in the Ifeifjaz, by an Arabiangeographer (Siiouti, cited by Quatreinere, Mrmnirttrur tes Xabattens, p. 38), near where Jcbtl Xdbtt ismarked in modern maps. The existence of this namein this locality is regard'd by M. Quatrcinere as anadditional argument for the identity of El-llaura withEcuceCome, proving that the country of the Nabataeidid actually extend so tar south. The fact of the originof the Nabataeans from Nebaioth the son of Ishmael,resting as it does on the respectable authority ofJosephus, followetl as lie is by S. Jerome (t'luaest.Htbr. in C'"t)rs. torn. ii. p. 530), and all subsequentwriters in the western world, lias been called inquestion by M. Quatremere in the Me'moire abovereferred to; who maintains tlmt they are in nosense Ishniaelitcs, nor connected by race with anyof tlie Arab families, but were Aramaeans, andidentical with the Chaldaeans. He cites a host ofancient and most respectable native Arabic authorsin proof of this theory; according to whose state­ments the name Nabats or Nabataeans designatedthe primitive and indigenous population of Chaldaeaand the neighbouring provinces, probably tho>e whomKnsebius designates Babylonians in contradistinctionfrom the Chaldaeans. They occupied the whole of 1 that country afterwards culled Irak-Ar.n\ in tlx| most extended sense of that name, even anum>bending several provinces beyond the Tigris; milis worthy of remark, that Mas 'udi mention & mr>nant of the Babylonians and Chaldaeans existing bihis day in the very place which is desicnatcd tb*iuar.>bcs of the Nabataeans, i. e. in the ?illAge%ort-ated in the swampy ground between Wasitk auiBasra, (lb. p. 66.)

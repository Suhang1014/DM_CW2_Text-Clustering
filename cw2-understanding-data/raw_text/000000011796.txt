It was not at least to thepersonal resentment of the regent that the mass of thesevictims were sacrificed; his furious hatred was directedsolely against the Marians, the authors of the hideous mas-87. 82. sacres of 667 and 672. At his command the tomb of theconqueror of Aquae Sextiae was broken open and his asheswere scattered in the Anio, the monuments of his victoriesover Africans and Germans were overthrown, and, as deathhad snatched himself and his son from Sulla's vengeance,his adopted nephew Marcus Marius Gratidianus, who hadbeen twice praetor and was a great favourite with theRoman burgesses, was executed amid the most cruel tor­tures at the tomb of Catulus the most lamentable of theMarian victims. In other cases also death had alreadyswept away the most notable of his opponents; of theleaders there survived only Gaius Norbanus, who laid handson himself at Rhodes, while the assembly was deliberating onhis surrender; Lucius Scipio, whose insignificance and pro­ cording to Floras (ii. 9, whence Augustin, de Civ. Dei, iii. 28), 2000 senators and knights. According to Plutarch (Sull. 31), 520 names were placed on the list in the first three days; according to Orosius (v. 21), 580 names duriDg the first days. There is no material contradiction between these various reports, for, on the one hand, it was not senators and knights alone that were put to death, and, on the other hand, the list remained open for months. When Appian, at another passage (i. 103), mentions as put to death or banished by Sulla 15 consulars, 90 senators, 2600 knights, he there confounds, as the context shows, the victims of the civil war throughout with the victims of Sulla. 102. 99. The 15 consulars were—Quintus Catulus, consul in 652; Marcus Antonius, 655; 117. 95. 94.

When, on the other hand, the Livianaccount in Eutropius (v. 9) and Orosius (v. 22). specifies as swept away (consumpti) in the Social and Civil wars, 24 consulars, 7 praetorians, 60 aedicilians, 200 senators, the calculation includes partly the men who fell in the Italian war, such as the consulars Aulus Albiuus, consul in 665; Titus Didius, 656; Publius Lupus, 664; Lucius Cato, 665; 99. 98.90. 89. partly perhaps Quiutus Metellus Numidicus (P. 217), Manius Aquillius, GaiusMarius the father, Gnaeus Strabo whom we may certainly regard as alsovictims of that period, or other men whose fate is unknown to us. Of thefourteen consular* killed three—'Rufus, Cinna, and Flaccus—fell throughmilitary revolts, while eight Sullan and three Marian consulars fell as victimsto the opposite party. On a comparison of the figures given above, 50 sena­tors and 1000 equitcs were regarded as victims of Marius, 40 senators and1600 equites as victims of Sulla; this furnishes a standard—at least notaltogether arbitrary—for estimating the extent of the mischief on both sides.

WAKS OF-THE JEWS. 837 when she had been at variance with him, contrived this match:he also got into Pheroras's favour, and into the favour of Cae­sar's friends by presents, and other ways of obsequiousness, and«ent no small sums of money to Rome: Saturninus also, and hisfriends in Syria, were all well replenished with the presents hemade them^ yet the more he gave, the more he was hated, asnot making these presents out of generosity, but spending hismoney out of fear. Accordingly, it so fell out, that the receiversbore him no more good-will than before, but that those towhom he gave nothing were his more bitter enemies. How­ever, he bestowed his money every day more and more pro­fusely, on observing that, contrary to his expectations, the kingwas taking care about the orphans, and discovering at the sametime his repentance for killing their fathers, by his commisera­tion of those that sprang from them. 2. Accordingly, Herod got together his kindred and friends;and set before them the children, and with his eyes full of tears,said thus to them: " It was an unlucky fate that took away" from me these children's fathers, which children are recom-" mended to me by that natural commiseration which their or-'" phan condition requires; however, I will endeavour, though" 1 have been a most unfortunate father, to appear a better" grandfather, and to leave these children such curators after" myself as are dearest to me.

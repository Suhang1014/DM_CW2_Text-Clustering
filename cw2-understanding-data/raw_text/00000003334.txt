The consummate skill of Belisarius em­braced the favourable opportunities: and as he chosethe ground and the moment, as he pressed the chargeor sounded the retreat, the squadrons which he de­tached were seldom unsuccessful. These partial ad­vantages diffused an impatient ardour among thesoldiers and people, who began to feel the hardshipsof a siege, and to disregard the dangers of a generalengagement. Each plebeian conceived himself to bea hero; and the infantry, who, since the decay of dis­cipline, were rejected from the line of battle, aspiredto the ancient honours of the Roman legion. Beli­sarius praised the spirit of his troops, condemnedtheir presumption, yielded to their clamours, andprepared the remedies of a defeat, the possibility ofwhich he alone had courage to suspect. In thequarter of the Vatican, the Romans prevailed; andif the irreparable moments had not been wasted inthe pillage of the camp, they might have occupiedthe Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of theGothic host. On the other side of the Tyber, Beli­sarius advanced from the Pincian and Salarian gates.But his army, four thousand soldiers perhaps, waslost in a spacious plain; they were encompassed andoppressed by fresh multitudes, who continually re­lieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians. Thevaliant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to con­quer; they died: the retreat (a hasty retreat) wascovered by the prudence of the general, and thevictors started back with affright from the formidableaspect of an armed rampart. The reputation ofBelisarius was unsullied by a defeat; and the vainconfidence of the Goths was not less serviceable tohis designs, than the repentance and modesty of theRoman troops.

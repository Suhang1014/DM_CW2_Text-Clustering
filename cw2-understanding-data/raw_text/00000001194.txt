Of this work, which consisted of thirty-onebooks, only the last eighteen are now extant; butthese books contain a very circumstantial history oftwenty-five years; during which period Ammianuswas an eye-witness to the greater part of the trans­actions which he relates. Minute accuracy, and strict .veracity appear to be characteristics of this writer,whom Mr. Gibbon repeatedly calls his faithful guide.Though Ammianus is evidently desirous of placingthe character of Julian in as favourable a light aspossible, yet he does not allow his partiality for theemperor to induce him to deviate from that strictadherence to truth which is required of an historian.He mentions the hypocrisy of Julian in endeavouringto gain the favour of the Christians in Gaul, by join­ing with them in the celebration of the Epiphany,though he had already in secret abandoned their faith.And he relates the execution of Ursulus, though hecannot deny that it was an act of ingratitude, as wellas injustice, on the part of the emperor: the recitalof which will be displeasing to the favourers (fauto-ribus) of Julian. He describes very minutely theevents of the Persian expedition; yet he abstainsfrom any censure on the imprudence of his hero, inrejecting an offer of peace under the walls of Ctesi-phon, when he might have dictated the conditions ofthe treaty; instead of which, he led the Romans intosuch a situation, that, in a short time afterwards, thearmy could not be extricated without the most hu­miliating sacrifices.

Natron Lukes, and depurated from them bya narrow ridge, is the Bahr-bc-la-Ma, or WaterlessRiver, a name given by the Arabs to this and otherhollows which have the appearance of baring oncebeen channels for water. It has been surmised thatthe lake Moeris (Birkt t-el- Keroum) may have beenconnected with the Mediterranean at some remoteperiod by this outlet. The Bahr-be-la-Ma containsagatised wood. (Wilkinson, Mod. Egypt ami Thebes,vol. i. p. 300.) The valley in which the Natron Lakes arecontained, was denominated the Kitriote nome(v6pot Ncrpiclms or NirpiaVij*, Strab. xvii. p. 803;Steph. B. s. v. NiTpfcu). It was, according toStrabo, a principal seat iff the worship of Serapis,and the only nome of Aegypt in which sheep weresacrificed. (Comp. Mac-rob. Saturn, i. 7.) TheSerapeian worship, indeed, seems to have prevailedon the western side of the Nile long before the Si-nopic deity of that name (Zeus Sinopites) was intro­duced from PonttU by Ptolemy Soter, -since therewas a very ancient temple dedicated to him at Kha-cotis, the site of Alexandreia (Tac. Hist. iv. 83),and another still more celebrated outside the wallsof Memphis. The monasteries of the Nitriote nomewere notorious for their rigorous asceticism, l'heywere many of them strong-built and well-guardedfortresses, and offered a successful resistance to therecruiting sergeants of Valens, when they attemptedto enforce the imperial rescript (Cot/. Theodos. xii.tit. 1. lex. 63), which decreed that monastic vowsshould not exempt men fr« m serving as soldiers.(Photios, p. 81, ed.

We have no clue to its position, but the re­semblance of name renders it probable that it is re­presented by the modern village of Xoara, on the N.slope of the Neptunian mountains, about 10 milesfrom the sea and 13 from Tyndaiis.

It has been supposed thatbe may refer to the western Ghats; but as Maleusis evidently derived from the Sanscrit main, a moun­tain, this identification cannot, we think, be main­tained. [V.]MALECECA.

At the entrance of the gulf is the north­western promontory of Euboea, and the islands Li-elndes, and into its furthest extremity the riverI-;*n beius flows. The gulf is called LamiactsSisua (i Aauiaxof koAitos) by Pausaiu'as (i. 4.§ S,viL 15. § 2, x. 1. § 2), from the importanttown of Lamia ; and in the same way the gulf isr.<w called Zituni, which is the modem name ofLucia. Livy, who usually terms it Maliacus Sinus,gives it in one place the name of Aenianum Sinus(xxriiL 5), which is borrowed from Polybius (x.42) (Comp. Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii.p. 4.)

MALIS(^MoAh-yS;MiiA(r, Herod, vii. 198: Eth.Ma>(f» j, Mi}Aievs), a small district of Greece, at thel-ad of the M&liac gulf, surrounded on all sides byobtains, and open only in the direction of the sea.The river Spercheius flowed through it. The limits ofMafia are fixed by the description of Herodotus. Itextended alittle north of the valley of the Spercheius tothe narrowest part of the straits of Thermopylae.AMierra was the northernmost town of the Mulians(Herod, vii. 198); the boundary passed betweenLuna and Anticyna. Anthela was their southcrn-awt town (vii. 176, 200). Inland, the Anop:ca,tke path over Mount Oeta, by which the Persianstamed the army of Lennidas, in part divided thetemtorv of the Trachinun Malians from that of the Oetaeans (vii. 217). A more particular descriptionof the locality is given under TiiKitMorvijiE.According to Stephanus B. (». v. MaAniis), theMalians derived their name from a town Malieus,not mentioned by any other ancient author, said tohave been founded by Mains, the son of Amphic-tyon. The Malians were reckoned among the Thcs-salians; but although tributary to the latter, theywere genuine Hellenes, and were from the earliesttimes members of the Amphicytonic council. Theywere probably Dorians, and were always in closeconnection with the acknowledged Doric states.Hercules, the great Doric hero, is represented as thefriend of Ceyx of Trachis, and Mount Oeta was thescene of the hero's death. Diodorns (xii. 59) evenspeaks of Trachis as the mother-town of Lacedaemon.When the Trachiuians were hard pressed by theirOetaean neighbours, about the commencement of thePcloponnesian War, they applied for assistance to theSpartans, who founded in consequence the colony ofHeraclcia near Trachis. (Thuc iii. 92.) Scylax (p. 24), who is followed by Diodorus(xviii. 11), distinguishes between the MnAieis andMaAim, the former extending along the northerncoast of the Maliac gulf from Lamia to Echinus;but, as no other writer mentions these towns as be­longing to the Lamians, we ought probably to readA,-n.:(/\, as K. 0. MUller observes. Thucydidcsmentions three divisions (fx/prj) of the Malians, calledParalii (riaodAioi), Priests ('Ifprjj), and Trachinii(Tpax'x'oi)' Who the Priests were is a matter onlyof conjecture: Grote supposes that they may havebeen possessors of the sacred spot on which theAmphictyonic meetings were held; while Leakeimagines that they were the inhabitants of theSacred City (ifobv oVtu), to which, according toCallimachus (Hymn, in Del. 287), the Hyper­borean offerings were sent from Dodona on theirway to Delus, and that this Sacred City was thecity Oeta mentioned by Stephanus B. The namesof the Paralii and Trachinii sufficiently indicatetheir position. The Malians admitted every man toa share in the government, who either had servedor was serving as a Hoplite (Ari.stot. Polit. iv. 10.§ 10). In war they were chiefly famous as slingeraand darters. (Thuc. iv. 100.) Trachis was the principal town of the Malians.There were also Anticyra and Anthela on thecoast; and others, of which the names only are pre­served, such as CoLACEIA (Theopoin. ap. Athen.vi. p. 254, f.), Aegoseia (Lycophr. 903; Steph. B.*. t?.), and luus (Schol. in Lycophr. I. c.; Steph. U.s. v.). (Miillcr, Dorians, vol. i. p. 50; Grote,Greece, vol. ii. p. 378; Leake, Northern Greece,vol. ii. p. 20.) MALLAEA, MALLOEA, or MALOEA, a townof southern Perrhaebia in Thessaly, perhaps repre­sented in name by Mologhuita, which Leako con­jectures to be a corruption of Malloea, with theaddition of Angusta. But as there are no remainsof antiquity at Afoldghvsta, Leake supposes Malloeato have occupied a height on the opposite side ofthe river, where are some vestiges of ancient walls.(Liv. xxxi. 41, xxxvi. 10, 13, xxxix. 25; Leake,Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 311.) MALLI (MiAAoi, Arrian, Anab. vi. 7, 8, 14),the inhabitants of the south part of the districtnow known by the name of the Panjdb. There wasprobably in ancient times a city from which theyderived their name, though the name of the town isnot given by ancient authors. (Arrian, L c.; Strab.

Constans was mur­dered by Magnentius "not far from the Hispaniae,in a castmm named Helena." (Eutrop. z. 9.) Vic­tor's Epitome (c. 41) describes Helena as a townvery near to the Pyrenees; and Zosimos has theHune (iL 42; and Orosius, vii. 29). It is said bysume writers that Helena was so named after theplace was restored by Constantino's mother Helena,or by Constantine, or by some of his children; butthe evidence of this is not given. The river of llli-beris is the Ticiiis of Mela, and Tecum of Pliny,now the Tech. In the text of Ptolemy (ii. 10) thename of the river is written Uteris. Some geographers have supposed Hliberis to beCutJioure, near Port Venire, which is a plain mis­take. [G. L.] ILLICI. puci.] ILLITULA.

After a defence, such asmi^ht be expected when despair of mercy was addedto national fortitude, the city was stormed and burntover the slaughtered corpses of all its inhabitants,children and women as well as men. (Liv. xxiii. 49,xxiv. 41, xxvi. 17,41, xxviii. 19,20.) Ten yearslater it had recovered sufficiently to be again besiegedby the Romans, and taken with the slaughter of allits adult inah population. (Liv. xxxiv. 10.) Underthe Roman empire it was a considerable city, withthe surname of Forum Jumum. Its site is believedto have been in the neighbourhood of Andujar,where the church of S.

Extent and Limits. — The Roman Illyricumwas of very different extent from the Illyris or oi'iAAvpioi of the Greeks, and was itself not the sameat all times, but must be considered simply as anartificial and geographical expression for the bor­derers who occupied the E. coast of the Adriatic,from the junction of that gulf with the Ionic sea, tothe estuaries of the river Po. The earliest writerwho has left any account of the peoples inhabitingthis coast is Scylax; according to whom (c. 19—27)the Illyrians, properly so called (for the Liburniansand Istrians beyond tnem are excluded), occupy thesea-coast from Libumia to the Chaonians of Epirus.The Bulini were the northernmost of these tribes, andthe Atnantini the southernmost. Herodotus (i. 196)includes under the name, the Heneti or Veneti, wholived at the head of the gulf; in another passage (iv.49) he places the Illyrians on the tributary streamsof the Morava in Servia. It is evident that the Gallic invasions, of whichthere are several traditions, threw the whole of thesedistricts and their tribes into snch confusion, that itis impossible to harmonise the statements of thePeriplus of Scylax, or the far later Scymnus ofChios, with the descriptions in Strabo and the Romanhistorians. In consequence of this immigration of the Ganls,Appian has confounded together Gauls, Thracians,Paconians, and Illyrians. A legend which he records(IUyr. 1) makes Celtus, Illyrius, and Gala, to havebeen three brothers, the sons of the Cyclups Poly­phemus, and is grounded probably on the inter­mixture of Celtic tribes (the Boii, the Scordisci, andthe Taurisci) among the Illyrians: the Iapodes, atribe on the borders "of Istria, are described by Strabo(iv. p. 143) as half Celts, half Illyrians. On arough estimate, it may be said that, in the earliesttimes, Illyricum was the coast between the Naro(Neretvd) and the Drilo (Drin), bounded on the E.by the Triballi. At a later period it comprised allthe various tribes from the Celtic Taurisci to theEpirots and Macedonians, and eastward as far asMoesia, including the Veneti, Pannonians, Dalma­tians, Dardani, Autariatae, and many others. Thisis Illyricum in its most extended meaning in theancient writers till the 2nd century of the Christianera: as, for instance, in Strabo (vii. pp. 313—319),during the reign of Augustus, and in Tacitus (Hist.i. 2, 9, 76, ii. 86; comp. Joseph. B.J. ii. 16), in hisaccount of the civil wars which preceded the fall ofJerusalem. When the boundary of Rome reached tothe Danube, the " Hlyricus Limes" (as it is desig­nated in the "Scriptores Historiae Augustae "), or"Illyrian frontier, comprised the following pro­vinces: — Noricum, Panuonia Superior, Pannonia D 2

Duringhis survey of tile coast, B. c. 332, Alexander theGreat perceived that the island would form, withthe help of art, an excellent breakwater to the har­bour of liis projected capital. He accordingly causedits southern extremity to be connected with the main­land by a stone mole seven stadia, or about anEnglish mile, in length, which from this circum­stance was called the Heptastadium or Seven-furlong Bridge. At either end the mole was leftopen for the passage of ships, and the apertureswere covered by suspension bridges. In later timesa street of houses, erected on the mole itself, con­verted the island of Pharos into a suburb of Alex­andria, and a considerable portion of the moderncity stands on the foundations of the old Hepta­stadium. Yet, long after its junction with the Delta, Pharoswas spoken of as an island iroAxu vrjtros, Aelian,//. An. ix. 21; rovp6rtpov Wjaoj, Zonar. iv. 10).The southern portion of this rocky ledge (j(tnp&s)was the more densely populated; but the celebratedlighthouse, or the Tower of the Pharos, stood at theNK. point, directly in a line with point Pharillon, onthe eastern horn of the Xevv Port. The lighthousewas erected, at a cost of 800 talents, in the reign ofPtolemy I., but was not completed until that of hissuccessor Philadelphia. Its architect was Sostratusof Cnidus, who, according to Pliny (xxxvi. 12. s. 18),was permitted by bis royal patron to inscribe hisown name upon its base. There is indeed anotherstory, in which it is related that Sostratus, beingforbidden to engrave his name on his work, secretlycut it in deep letters on a stone of the building,which he then adroitly covered with some softer andperishable material, on which were inscribed thestyle and titles of Ptolemy. Tims a few genera­tions would read the name of the king, but posteritywould behold the authentic impress of the archi­tect.

Pharoswa.s the seat, of several temples, tho most conspi­cuous of which was one dedicated to Hephaestos,standing near the northern extremity of the Hepta­stadium. That Pharos, in common with many of the Deltaiccities, contained a considerable population of Jews,is rendered probable by the fact that here the trans­lators of the Hebrew Scriptures resided during theprogress of their work. (Joseph. Atttiq. xii. 2. § 13,)Julius Caesar established a colony at Pharos, lessperhaps to recruit a declining population than witha view t-» garrison a post so important as regardedthe turbulent Alexandrians. (Caesar, £. CVr.iii. 112.)Subsequently the island seems to have been com­paratively deserted, and inhabited by fishermen alone.(Montfaucon, Sur le Phare dAlexandrie, Mem. deI'Acad, de* fnscript. ix. p. 285.) [W.

"enemy to pass, they would soon sec more of them in"the Palatium and capitol, than in the Janiculum; and,"for that reason, he advised and charged them to de-"molish the bridge by the axe, by fire, or by any other"means of destruction in their power, that, in the mean"time, he would singly sustain the enemy's attack, with"all the vigour he was master of." He then advanced to the entrance of the bridge, andbeing easily distinguished among those who had turnedtheir backs and fled, facing about to engage with theenemy, hand to hand, by that surprising instance ofgallantry, he confounded the Etrurians. Two, however,Spurius Lartius, and Titus Herminius, men eminent fortheir birth and noble actions, were ashamed to leave himwith them: for a short time, he stood the first shock ofdanger, and the most disorderly part of the assault; andat last, upon a call from those who were employed incatting down the bridge, he'obliged his companions toretire, upon the little that remained. Then looking fierce­ly at the Etrurian officers, and with a threatening air, hechallenged them,one by one, and upbraided them all;telling them, "That they were the slaves of haughty"tyrants, who, regardless of their own liberty, came to"wrest it from their neighbours." They hesitated for some time, and looked at one ano­ther, who should step out to begin the attack; shame atlength put the army in motion, who setting up a shoutthrew their javelins from every quarter at a single ene­my; all which, when he received on his shield, and stoodfirm and undaunted,* to keep possession of the bridge,they endeavoured to justle him off by force; when thecrash of the bridge, that was now broke down, and theshouts of the Romans, rejoicing that it was done, stunnedthem with the shock, and suspended their fury. ThenCocles, " O father, Tiberinus," says he, "earnestly do"I pray, that thou wouldst receive these arms and this"soldier, and that thy streams would be merciful."Wherefore he threw himself into the Tiber, armed aslie was, and amidst ten thousand darts, that fell abouthim, he swimmed across the river to his own party, with- * Ingcns gradus, stately step.

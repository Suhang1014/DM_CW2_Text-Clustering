In like manner with this military supre­macy the civil superintendence, which (including the su­preme administrative jurisdiction which could hardly beseparated from it) the Eoman government had always andrightly reserved to itself over the dependent Italian communi­ties, was extended in such a way that the Italians were hardlyless than the provincials abandoned without protection tothe caprice of any one of the numberless Roman magis­trates. In Teanum Sidicinum, one of the most considerableof the allied towns, a consul had ordered the chief magis­trate of the town to be scourged with rods at the stake inthe market-place, because, on the consul's wife expressing adesire to bathe in the men's bath, the municipal officers hadnot driven forth the bathers quickly enough, and the bathappeared to her not to be clean.

In consequence of this treatment of the Italianson the part of the Roman government, the variance, whichthe wisdom of their ancestors had carefully fostered betweenthe Latin and the other Italian communities, could not fail, ifriot to disappear, at any rate to undergo abatement (ii. 335).The fortresses of Rome and the districts kept to their allegiance by the fortresses lived now under the like oppression;the Latin could remind the Picentine that they were bothin like manner "subject to the fasces;" the overseers andthe slaves of former days were now united by a commonhatred towards the common despot. While the present state of the Italian allies was thustransformed from an endurable dependence into the mostoppressive bondage, they were at the same time deprived ofevery prospect of obtaining better rights.

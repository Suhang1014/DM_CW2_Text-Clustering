It was also so contrived by nature, thatit could not be easily ascended; for it is, as it were, ditchedabout with such valleys on all sides, and to such a depth, thatthe eye cannot reach their bottoms, and such as are not easilyto be passed over, and even such as it is impossible to fillup with earth. For that valley which cuts it on the westextends to three-score furlongs, and did not end till it cameto the lake Asphaltitis; on the same side it was also thatMacherus had the tallest top of its hill elevated above therest.

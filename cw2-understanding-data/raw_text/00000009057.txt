In Strabo's time it was called Neroassus(Nypnaaaos). and served as a treasury to Sicinus,who was striving to obtain the sovereignty of Cap-padocia, [*L. S.J NOKBA (Nwfj&x: Nwpgoi-or, Norbanus: Aormrt), an ancient city of Latiuin, situated on theborder of the Yolseian mountains, overlooking thePontine .Marshes, and about midway between Coraand Setia. There seems no doubt that Norba wasan ancient Latin city; its name is found in the listgiven by Dionysius of the thirty cities of the League;and again, in another passag<\ lie expressly calls ita city of the Latin na'ion. (Dionys. v. 61, vii. 13;Niebuhr, vol. ii. note 21.) It appeal's, indeed, cer­tain that all the three cities, Cora, Norba, andSetia, were originally Latin, before they fell intothe hands of the Volscians. The statement thatNorba received a fresh colony in b. C- 402. imme­diately after the conclusion of the league of Bornewith the Latins, points to the necessity, already felt,of strengthening a position of much importance,winch was well calculated, as it is expressed byLivy, to be the citadel of the surrounding country("quae arx in Pomptino csset," Li v. ii. 34; Dionys.vii. 13). But it seems probable that Norba, as wellas the adjoining cities of Cora and Setia, fell intothe hands of the Volscians during the height oftheir p'>wer, anil received a fresh colony on thebreaking up of the latter. (Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 108.)For it is impossible to believe that these strongfortresses had continued in the hands of the Romansand Latins throughout their wars with the Vol­scians so much nearer home; while, on the otherhand, whim their names reappear in history, it is asordinary " coloniae Latinae," and not as independentcities. Hence none of the three are mentioned inthe great Latin War of n. <:. 340, or the settlementof affairs by the treaty that followed it. But, justbefore the breaking out of that war, and again inR. c. 327, we find the territories of Cora, Norba, andSetia ravaged by their neighbours the Privernates,whose incursions drew upon them the vengeance ofKoine. (Liv. vii. 42, viu. 1.19.) No further men­tion occurs of Norba till the period of the SecondPunic War, when it was one of the eighteen Latincolonies which, in b. c. 209, expressed their readi­ness to bear the continued burthens of the war, andto whose fidelity on this occasion Livy ascribes thepreservation of the Roman state, (Liv. xxvii. 10.)It seems to have been chosen, from its strong andsecluded position, as one of the places where theCarthaginian hostages were kept, and, in consequence,was involved in the servile conspiracy of the yearC. c. 198, of which the neighbouring town of Setiawas the centre. (Liv. xxxii. 2, 26.) [Sbtia.] Norba played a more important part during thecivil wars of Marias and Sulla; having leen occu­pied by the partisans of the former, it was the last |city of Italy that held out, even after the fall ofPraeneste and the death of the younger Marius,r.. <". 82. It was at last betrayed into the handsof Aemilius Lepidus, the general of Sulla; but thegarrison put themselves and the other inhabitantsto the sword, and set fire to the town, which wasso entirely destroyed that the conquerors could carryoff no booty. (Appian, B. C. i. 94.) It seems cer­tain that it was never rebuilt: Strabo omits all'notice of it, where he mentions all the other townsthat bordered the Pontine Marshes (v. p. 237); and, | though Pliny mentions the Norbani anwir ti»existing *• populi" of Latiuin. in another j ■--reckons Norba among the cities that in his ur*had altogether disappeared (iii. 5. s. 9. lU 64.

Gotk. iv, 5.)The most remarkable building in Phanagoria seemato have been a temple of Aphrodite, sttmamed Apa-tarns {*Avdrovpos), because the goddess, when at­tacked by the giants in this place, is said to havesummoned Herculea to her aid, and then to haveconcealed him and to have handed over the giauUseparately to him to be slain (&o\o$oviiy «'£ awarnT,Strab. xi. p, 495; Steph. B. ». v. 'Airttrovpov;Bockh, Inter. No. 2120.) We learn from an in­scription that this temple was repaired by Saum-mates, one of the kings of Bosporus. The site ofPhanagoria is now only a mass of bricks and pot­tery; and there is no building above ground. Onecause of the disappearance of all the ancient monu­ments at Phanagoria was the foundation in itsneighbourhood at an early period of tbe Russiancolony of Tmutarakan. Dutour noticed traces oftowers towards the eastern extremity of the town,where the citadel probably stood. The town of 'in-man contains several ancient remains, inscriptions,fragments of columns, &c, which have been broughtfrom Phanagoria. There are numerous tombs abovotbe site of Plianagoria, but they have not been ex­plored like those at Panticapaeum. In one of them,however, which was opened towards the end of lastcentnry there was found a bracelet of the purestmassive gold, representing the body of a serpent,having two heads, which were studded with rubiesso as to imitate eyes and also ornamented with rowsof gems. It weighed three-quarters of a pound.(Clarke, Travels, vol. i. p. 394, seq.; Pallas, Reisen,vol. ii. p. 286, &c.; Dubois, Voyage autaur du Can-case, vol. v. p. 64, seq.; Ukert, vol. iii. pt. ii. p. 491.) PHANAROKA (4>a>d>uia), a broad and exten­sive valley in Pontus, watered by the rivers Iris,Lycns, and Scylax, and endured between the chainof Paryadres to the east, and Mounts Lithrus andOphlimus to the west. The soil there was thebest in Pontus, and yielded excellent wine andoil and other produce in abundance. (Strab. ii. p.73, xii. pp. 547, 556, 559; Plin. vi.4; PtoL v. 6.§ 3, where it is erroneously called Phanagoria.)Phanaroea contained the towns of Kupatoria, Cabira,Polemoninm, and others. [Pontus.] [L. S.] PHA'NOTE (FAh. ♦oewcr, Pol ), a stronglyfortified town of Chaonia in Epirus, and a place ofmilitary importance. It stood on the site of themodern Gardkiki, which is situated in the midst ofa valley surrounded by an amphitheatre of moun­tains, through which there are only two narrowpasses. It lies about halfway between the sea andthe Antigonean passes, and was therefore of im­portance to the Romans when they were advancingtrom Illyria in b. c. 169.

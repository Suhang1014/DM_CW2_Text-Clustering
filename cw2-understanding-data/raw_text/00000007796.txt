TOLOUS travelled in Gallia; and it is more probable thanthe tradition that the gold of Tolosa was the pro­duce of the plunder of Delphi by Brenmia andlus men, among whom it is said there were someTectosagea (Justin, xxxii. c. 3); tor it is verydoubtful if any of Urennus' soldiers got buck toGallia, if we admit that they came from Gallia.Tnlo>a was in some kind of alliance with Rome(Dion Cass, xxxiv. 97) about u. c. 106; hut the'leutones ami Cimbri at this time h:id brokeu intoGallia, and tear or policy induced the Tolosates tohide witli them. Q. Serviliua Caepio (consul ii. c.1 06) inado this a jut-text fur attacking Tolosa,which he took and plundered of its treasures, eitherin u.c. IOC or ii: the following year. This act ofsacrilege was Mip[K>ned to have been punished bythe gods, for Caepio was defeated by the Cimbriit. c. 105, and his army was de.-troyed. (Liv. Epit.67; Orosius, v. 15; Gell, iii. 9.) The treasure ofTulosa never reached Rome, and perhaps Caepiohimself laid hold of some of it. However this mayhe, the "Allium Tolosanum" became a proverb.All who had touched the consecrated treasure cameto a miserable end- It seems that there was in­quiry made into the matter at Koine, for Cicero(f)e Nat. Ih'orutn, iii. 30) speaks of a "quaestiouuri Tolosani." The Tolosani or Tolosates were that division ofthe Tee t usages which was nearest to the Aquitani.A place called Fines, between Tolosa and Carcaso,denotes the boundary of the territory of Tolosa inthat direction, as this term often indicates a terri­torial limit in the Roman geography of Gallia[ Fines]; and another place named Fines marksthe boundary on the north between the Tolosatesand the Cadurci. Pliny (iii. 4) mentions Tolosa among the Op-pida Latina of Narbonensis, or those towns whichhad the Latinitas, and, as Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 9)names it a Colonia, we must suppose that itwas made a Colonia Latina. Tolosa maintained itsimportance under the Empire. Ausonius {OrdoNob. Urb. xii.) describes Tulosa as surrounded by abrick wall of great circuit, and as a populous city,which had sent out inhabitants enough to foundfour other cities. The name Palladia, which Martial(A/', ix. lol), Sidonius Apollinaris, and Ausoniusgive to Tolosa appears to refer to the cultivation ofthe liberal arts in this Gallic city — "Te sibi Palladiae antetulit toga docta Tolosae."

He states the date with which he intends to begin his history, viz.the second consulship of Galba = a. u. c. 822. 2. He gives thereason why he does not commence at an earlier date, viz. that manyhave written the history of the whole period prior to that date.3. But he subdivides that whole period into two parts, viz. the Repub­lic and the Empire, the former of which has boen treated with asmuch freedom as eloquence, but not so the latter. Tacitus may havealready had in mind the plan, which he afterwards executed (in hisAnnals), of writing also the history of the latter period, because,though written by many, it had been treated without ability orimpartiality. Cf. Ann. 1, 1, a passage which sheds much light on this. 5. Actium. Where Augustus defeated Antony and establishedhimself in the sole possession of the supreme power.—Potentiam. ALpotestatem. Potestas est i^ovota, potentia 56vafus. So Wr.,* who argues,that not omnis potestas, all lawful authority, but omnis potentia, allpower and might was concentred in one man, that he might preservepeace. For this distinction, cf. His. 1, 13; Ann. 3, 69; Cic. prodomo, 30. See also Or. in loc. 6. Conferri = brought together, united in one man. 7« Siruul veritas, etc. See a similar passage in Dion, 53, 19. 8. Ut alienae. Since it was the property of another, i. e. theemperor, not the people. So Wr., Or. and Dod. As if it were a for­eign state; for they had no more to do with it, and therefore caredand knew no more about it, than if it were a foreign republic. SoErnesti. A truly republican sentiment, according to either interpre­tation. The former is preferable.—Rursus. Cf. note A. 29. 9. Iufensos. Sc. principibus. 10. Ambltionem. Lit., going about to solicit favor. Henceflattery to the great, explained below by adulationi. 11. Adverseris. So the MSS., Wr. and Dod. Al. averseris,Rup., Or. But without good authority or reason. For the accusativeafter adversor, cf. Gr. 224, R. 4; Z. 386. Also Freund's Lexicon,sub voce. For the subjunctive here, cf. Gr. 260, II.; Z. 523. Youmay easily withstand or resist. Wr. refers it to the writer: You(any writer) may easily withstand the temptation to flatter. This ismoro pertinent to the connection. But scriptoris suggests rather theidea, that the reader can easily withstand, etc. So Rup. and mostothers.—Pronis auribus, literally, ears inclining or bending forward= willing ears. * The Authorities most frequently cited in these Notes, are cited by theirinitial letters or syllables, thus: Wr. = Walther, Rup. => Ruperti; Or. =Orelli; Dod. = DSderlein, &c Gr stands for Andrews and Stodd&rd'lGrammar; Z. foi Zumpt s do

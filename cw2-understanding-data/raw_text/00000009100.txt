It is to the effect that the ambassadors toAlexander were Kc'Atoi ir*pl rbv 'A5piar(vii. p. 301),anil that Ptolemy wna the authority. Nevertheless,Ptolemy may have written TaAdrai, and suchGalatae may have been the Galatae of the OlbianInscription. [See infra and SciRi.] Tlie next Macedonian who crossed the Danubewas lA'simachua, who crossed it only to re-cross it inhis retreat, and who owed his life to the generosityof a Getic prince Dromichaetes. This was aboutB.C. 31*2. Our next authorities (fragmentary and insufficient)for the descendants of the Ilerodotean Scythians arethe occupants of the Greek towns of the Eux'ine.Even those to the south of the Danube, Callatis,Apollonia, &c, had some Scythians in the neiirh-hood, sometimes as enemies, sometimes as protec­tors,—sometimes as protectors against other barba­rians, sometimes as protectors of Greeks againstGreeks, as was the ease during the Scythian andThracian wars (if Ly*imachus. Thechief frontagers,however, were Getae. Between Olbia, to the northof the Danube (=01biopolis of Herodotus), andthe native tribes of its neighbourhood, the relationsare illustrated by the inscription already noticed.(Bbckh, Jtutcr, Grace, no. 2058.) It records avote uf public gratitude to Protogenes, and indicatesthe troubles in which he helped Ins fellow-citizens.The chief of those arose from the pressure of thebarbarians around, by name Saudaratae, Thi>ametae,Sciri [see Sciri], Galatae, and Scythae. The dateof tins inscription is uncertain; but we may see theimport, of the observations on the word Galataewhen we find the assumption that they were Gaulsof Gallia used as an instrument of criticism:—-" Thedate of the above inscription is not specified; theterror inspired by the Gauls, even to other barba­rians, seems to suit the second century b. c. betterthan it suits a later period." (Grote, Uiit. ofGreece, vol. sii. p. 644, note.) What, however, ifthe Galatae of WcUlnchia were as little Galli as thet 'ermaiiians of Persia are Germans, or as Galacz isthe. same as Calais? The present writer wholly dis­connects them, and ignores the whole system ofhypothetical migrations by which the identity issupported. A second Olbia in respect to its Helleno-Scythicrelations, was Bosporus, or Panticapaeum, a Greeksettlement which lasted from B.C. 480 till the reignof Mithridates. [Panticapaeum.] From Bosporus there was a great trade withAlliens in corn, hides, arid Scythian slaves,—Scythes,as the name of a slave, occurring as early as thetime of Thcoguis, and earlier in the Atheniandrama than those of Davus and Geta (Dacian andGetic) which belong to the New Comedy,—Scythesand Scythaena being found in the Old. The political relations were those of independentmunicipalities; sometimes (sovereign, sometimes pro­tected. The archons of Bosporus paid tribute tothe Scythian princes of their neiglitwurhood, whenthey were powerful and united; took it, when theScythians were weak and disunited. Under thislatter category came the details of the division oft;ie Maeotae, viz., Sindi, Toraeti, Dandarii, Thetes,&e. Of these, Parysades I.

Jn the civil wars, too, of Bourns, theScythians took a part; nor were there wanting ex­amples uf Scythian n aimers even in the case of the Panticapaean potentates.

But for the king himself, he was not at all irritated againstJeremiah, such was his gentle and righteous disposition ; yet thathe might not be engaged in a quarrel with those rulers at such atime, by opposing what they intended, he let them do withthe prophet, whatsoever they would: Whereupon, when theking had granted them such a permission, they presently cameinto the prison and took him; and let him down with a cordinto a pit full of mire, that he might be suffocated, and die ofhimself.

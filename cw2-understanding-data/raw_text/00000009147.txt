Sl'MLOCKNSK, was apparently a Romancolony of some importance in the Apri Decumatesof Germany, The Table erroneously places the townin Vindelieia, whence some antiquarians have re­garded Samulocenae and Suinlocenne as two differentj'la-es. But there can be no doubt that they areonly two forms of the same name belonging to onetown, the site of which is occupied by the modernSulchen, near Rnttenbnrg on the Keckur, wheremany Roman remains, such as coins, inscriptions,and arms, have been found.

There has been some question whether thisis the name of a man or of a place. As the textstands in the Periplu?, it would seem to be that of aruler of the coast-district in the neighbourhood ofBombay. On the other hand, Ptolemy speaks of thesame territory under the title of 'Aoia/fij Xatitvwv;whence Beufey (Ersch and Griiber, EncycU art.Ind'ten) argues, with strong probability, that thereading in the Periplus is incorrect, and that Ptolemyis right in making the name that of a people ratherthan of a chief.

Ezekiel also foretold in Babylon what calamities werecoming upon the people, which when he heard, he sent accountsof them into Jerusalem: But Zedekiah did not believe their pro­phecies, for the reasons following: It happened that the two pro­phets agreed with one another in what they said, as in all otherthings, that the city should be taken, and Zedekiah himself shouldbe taken captive; but Ezekiel disagreed with him, and said that"Zedekiah should not see Babylon," while Jeremiah said, tohim, That " the king of Babylon should carry him away thither"in bonds."

But Jeremiah came among them, and prophesied whatcontradicted those predictions, and what proved to be true, That"they did ill, and deluded the king; that the Egyptians would"be of no advantage to them, but that the king of Babylon"would renew the war against Jerusalem, and besiege it again,"and would destroy the people by faminer and carry away those"that remained into captivity, and would take away what they"had as spoils, and would carry off those riches that were in"the temple; nay, that, besides this, he would burn it, and ut-"terly overthrow the city, and that they should serve him and'his posterity seventy years; that then the Persians and the

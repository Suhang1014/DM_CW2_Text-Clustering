H. D.] PRIVERNUM (Tlptovfprov: Eth. Privernas -atis:IHpemo Vecchio), an ancient and important city ofthe Volscians, afterwards included, with the rest ofthe territory of that people, in Latium, in the moreextended sense of the name. It was situated in theVolscian mountains, or Monti />/>mi; but not, liknSetia and Norba, on the front towards the plain ofthe Pontine Munshes, hut at some distance furtherback, in the valley of the Amasemis. Virgil repre­sents it as an ancient city of the Volscians, and thoresidence of Met a bus, the father of Camilla (Am. xi.540); and there is no reason to doubt that it wiikoriginally a city of that people. Its name is notindeed mentioned during nny of the earlier wars ofthe Volscians against Rome ; but on these occasionsthe name of the people is generally given collectively,and the brunt of the war naturally fell upon thosecities which more immediately adjoined the frontiersof Latium. When the name of Privernum first a]<-pears in history it is as a city of considerable powerand importance, holding an independent position, andable not only to engage in, but to sustain, a waragainst Rome single-handed. In n.c.358 the Pri-vernates drew upon themselves the hostility of Romeby plundering the lands of the Roman colonists whohad been recently settled in the Pontine Plains. Timnext year they were attacked by the consul C. Mar-cius, their forces defeated in the field, and they them­selves cempelled to submit (Liv. vii. 15, 16). Rutttiough their submission is represented as an uncon­ditional surrender (deditio). they certainly con­tinued to form an independent and even powerfulstate, arid only a few years afterwards again venturedto attack the Roman colonies of Norba and Setia,for which they were speedily punished by the consulC. Plautius: their city is said to have been tak*>n,and two-thirds of their territory forfeited. (Id. vii.

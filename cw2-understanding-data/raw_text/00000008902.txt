Ostiensis: Ostia), a cityof Latium, situated at the mouth of the Tiber, fromwhich position it derived its name. It was on theleft bank of the river, at a distance of 16 miles fromRome, by the road which derived from it the nameof Via Ostiensis. {Itin. Ant. p. 301.) All an­cient writers agree in representing it as founded bythe Roman king Ancus Marcius; and it seemscertain that it always retained the position of acolony of Rome, and was at no period independent.From its position, indeed, it naturally became theport of Rome, and was essential to that city, notonly for the purpose of maintaining that naval su­premacy which it had established before the close ofthe regal period, but for securing its supplies ofcorn and other imported produce which was carriedup the Tiber. Ancus Marcius at the same time es­tablished salt-works on the site, which for a longtime continued to supply both Rome itself and theneighbouring country in the interior with that ne­cessary article. (Liv. i. 33; Dionys. iii. 44; Cic.de Rep. ii. 3, 18; Strab. v. p. 232; Flor. i. 4;Eutrop. i. 5; Fest.p. 197.) Therecan be no doubtthat the importance of Ostia must have continuedto increase with the growing prosperity and powerof Rome; but it is remarkable that we meet withno mention of its name in history until the period ofthe Second Punic War. At that time it appears asa commercial and naval station of the utmost im­portance; and was not only the port to which thecom from Sicily and Sardinia was brought for thesupply of Rome itself, as well as of the Romanlegions m the field, but was the permanent stationof a Roman fleet, for the protection both of thecapital, and the neighbouring shores of Italy,(Liv. xxii. 11,37, 57,xxiii. 38,xxv. 20,xzvii. 22.)It was at this time still reckoned one of the 11 colo-niae maritime*;" but on account of its peculiar im­portance in relation to Rome, it enjoyed special privi­leges; so that in B.C. 207, when the other maritimecolonies endeavoured to establish a claim to ex­emption from levies for military service, this wasallowed only in the case of Ostia and Antium; thecitizens of which were at the same time compelled tobe constantly present as a garrison within their ownwalls. (Liv. xxvii. 38.) On a subsequent occa­sion (b. c. 191) they attempted to extend this ex­emption to the naval service also; but their claimwas at once disallowed by the senate. (W. xxxvi.3.) Even after the complete establishment of thonaval power of the Roman Republic, Ostia seems tohave continued to be the usual station of a Romanfleet: and in B. c. 67 it was there that a squadron,which had been assembled for the repression of theCilician pirates, was attacked by the pirates them­selves, and the ships either destroyed or taken.(Cic pro Leg. Alanil. 12; Dion Cass, xxxvi. 5.)0>tia itself also suffered severely during thecivil wars of Sulla and Mnrius, having been takenby the latter in n. c. 87, and given tip to plunderand devastation by his soldiers. (Ajipian, B. C. i. 67; Liv. Epit. lxxix; Oros. v. 19; Flor. iii. 21. § 12.) But its position at tho mouth of the Tiber, as theI port of Rome, secured it from decay: and so un­ it K 3

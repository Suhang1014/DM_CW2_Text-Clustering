Inrt gmmeration of the Gallic people (iv. 33) The Santones gave name to that division ofFrance before the revolution which was namedSmUongt, the chief part of which is included inthe French department of Charente Injeriwre.The coast of the territory of the Santones is lowand marshy; the interior is generally level and fer­tile. D'Anville supposed that the territory of theSantones comprehended the diocese of Sainta, andthe small province of Aunts on the north-west. The wormwood of this country is spoken of byvarious writers, Pliny (xxvii. 38), and Martial(Ep. ix. 95): — "Santonica medicata dedit mihi pocula virga." Martial (xiv. 128) and Juvenal (viii. 145) men­tion a "cucullus" with the name "Santonicus."It appears that some thick coarse woollen clothswere imported from Gallia into Italy. Havercamp in his edition of Orosius (vi. 7) give*a coin with the name " Arivos," and on the otherside the legend "Santonos" in Roman capitals withthe figure of a horse in action. He gives alsoanother coin with the same legend; and a thirdwith the abbreviated name "Sant" and the nameof " Q. Doci ' on it. [G. L.] SA'NTONUM PORTUS (2oit«W Mmi»). Pto­lemy in his description of the coast of Celto^alatiaAquitania (ii. 7. § 1) proceeds from south to north.Next to the outlets of the Garonne he places Santo-num Port us, and next to it Santonuin Proinontorium(ZavTOwr ixpor). The outlet of the river Canen-telus is placed north of the proinontorium. The Ca-rantonus of Ausonius is certainly the Charente [Ca-kamtonus] ; and Ptolemy's Canentelus is a differentriver, or, if it is the same river, be has placed it wrong. It is impossible to determine what ia the SantonuinPortus of Ptolemy. If it is RocheUe, as Borne geo­graphers maintain, and if Ptolemy's Canentelus is theCAarente, he has placed their positions in wrongorder. It seems very unlikely that Ptolemy shouldmention a river between the Garonne and Loire, andnot mention the Charente. The only other large riverbetween the Garonne and the Loire is the Sevre Nior-iaue, which ia north of La KocheUe, and if Ptolemy'sCaneuteloa is the Setre, the Santonum Portusmight be LaRochelk. D'Anville supposes San­tonum Portus to be the embouchure of the Seudrt,which open* into the sea opposite the southern ex­tremity of the Jtle cTOIeron ; bnt he does not un­dertake to fix the position of the Santonum Promon-torium. The latitudes of Ptolemy cannot be trusted,and hi* geography of Gallia is full of errors. [G.L.]SA'NTONUM PKOMONTO'hUUM. [Sasto- MDM PORTUS.1 SAOCE.

There has been much dispute, as towhat river Ptolemy intended by this name, as atpresent there is no stream existing which correspondswith his description. Forbiger has conjectured withsome reason that it is the same as the Mascaa ofXenophon (Auub. i. 5. § 4), which flowed about35 paraaangs to the E. of the Chabora* (Khobar),and surrounded the town of Corsote: Ptolemy wouldseem to have confounded it with the Mygdonius.[Myodonius.] [V.] SAPAEI (iaimioi or ZdVaioi), s Thracianpeople, occupying the southern portion of the Pan­ 3 X 4.

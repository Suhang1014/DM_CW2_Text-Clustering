(ChristianRemembrancer, No. Ixvi. N. S., vol. xviii. pp. 425,42(i.) A few additions to this graphic sketch ofthe general geography of Palestine will suffice tocomplete the description of its main features, and tofurnish a nomenclature for the more detailed noticesivhich must follow. This addition will be best sup­plied by the naturalist Iiussegger, whose travelshave furnished a desideratum in the geography ofPalestine. It will, however, bo more convenient toconsider below his third division of the country,comprehending the river Jordan and the Dead Sea,with its volcanic phaenomcnn, as those articles havebeen reserved for this place, and the historical im­portance of them demands a fuller account than isgiven in his necessarily brief summary. He dividesth-1 country as follows: — 1. 'Die fruitful plain extending along the coastfrom Gaza to Jung, north-east of Beirut. 2. The in'Umtain range separating this plain fromthi* valley of the Jordan, which, commencing withJtbtl Khniil, forms the rocky land of Judaea, Sa­maria, and Galilee, and ends w ith the knot of moun­tains trom which Libanus and Antilihanus extendtowards the north. 3. The valley of the Jordan, with the basins ofthe hike of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, as far as\Vrady-el-Gltor, the northern end of Wady-el-A raba. 4. The country on the cast of the Jordan, as faras the parallel of Damascus. (1.) The part of the coast plain extendingfrom the isthmus of Suez between the sea and themountains of Judaea and Samaria, and bounded bythe ridge of Carmel, belongs, in regard to its fer­tility, to the moot beautiful regions of Syria. Thevegetation in all its forms is that of the warmerparts of the shores of the Mediterranean; in thesouthern districts the palm Bounties. The mountains of Judaea and Samaria, whichrise to the height of 2000 feet above the sea, followthe line of the plain until they meet the ridge ofCarmel. The coast district belongs partly to the olderand newer phoccuc of the marine deposits, and partlyto the chalk and Jura formations of the neighbour­ing mountainous country. I*o the north of Carmel the hilly arable landoccurs again. Still further north, with the exception of a fewstrips of land about Acre, Sur, Seida, Beirut, &c,the coast plain becomes more and more narrowed bythe mountains, which extend towards the sea, untilthere only remains here and there a very small stripof coast. Several mountain streams, swollen in the rainyseason to torrents, flow through deep narrow valleysinto the plain, in part fertilising it; in part, wherethere are no harriers to oppose their force, spreadingdevastation far and wide. Of these the principalare Xahr-eJ-Kelb, Xahr-ed-Damur, the Auli, theiSahnratit h, Xahr-el-Kusimith. Xtthr Mukuttu, Sec. The mouutuin sides of Lebanon, trom Seida toBeirut, arc cultivated in terraces; the principalproduct of this kind of cultivation is the vine andmulberry; the secondary, Jigs, oranges, pomegra­nates, and, in general, the so-called tropical fruits. The want of grass begins to show itself mSjraiand especially on the sides of the promontory, o*ugto the long continued drought*. The SyrianiM*tains along the coast north of Carmel. and espc-iiiythe sides of Lebanon, are, with the exception d Ufgarden-trees, and a tew scattered pica, asLtJdevoid of wood. (2.) The land immediately towards the •which follows the line of coast from south to rr-*.«at a distance now greater now less, rises in the t'rr.of a lofty mountain chain, the summiu ofare for the most i<art rounded, ard rarriy [«i-J.forming numerous plateaux, and inclndii 1 -j*whole space between the coa*t on the west, WJ u*valley of the Jordan, with the Dead Sea »i u*lake of Tiberias, on the east, having sa ivenffbreadth of from 8 to 10 Gennan mile*.

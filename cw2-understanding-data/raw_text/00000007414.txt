And when he was come, he was car.Sried in a royal litter through the streets, and all the ornamentsabout him was such as kings are adorned withal; and this wasat the expence of those that entertained him. The multitudealso flocked about him greatly, and made mighty acclamationsto him, and nothing was omitted which could be thought suit­able to such as had been so unexpectedly preserved. 2. When this thing was told Caesar, he did not believe it, be­cause Herod was not easily to be imposed upon in such affairs aswere of great concern to him ; yet, having some suspicion itmight be so, he sent one Celadus, a freed man of his, and onethat had conversed with the young men themselves, and bade himbring Alexander into his presence : so he brought him, being nomore accurate in judging about him than the rest of the multi­tude. Yet did not he deceive Caesar; for although there werea resemblance between him and Alexander, yet was it not so ex­act as to impose on such as were prudent in discerning ; for thisspurious Alexander had his hands rough, by the labours he hadbeen put to, and instead of that softness of body which the otherhad, and this as derived from his delicate and generous educartion, this man, for the contrary reason, had a rugged body.When, therefore, Caesar saw how the master and the scholaragreed in this lying story, and in a bold way of talking, he in­quired about Aristobulus, and asked what became of him, who(it seems) was stolen away together with him, and for whatreason it was that he did not come along with him, and endea­vour to recover that dominion which was due to his high birthfclso?

For this contrivance is too considerable a piece" of villany to be undertaken by one of thy age." According­ly, because he had no other way to take, he told Caesar the con­trivance, and after what manner, and by whom it was laid to­gether. So Caesar, upon observing the spurious Alexander to'be a strong active man, and fit to work with his hands, that heAnight not break his promise to him, put him among those that G 2 were

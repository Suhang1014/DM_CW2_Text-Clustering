Besides Ilkkda, their chiefcities were: — the colony of Celsa (Velilla, nearX'lm), Osca (Hwsca), famous in the story of Ser-torius; and Atiianagia, which Livy (xxi. 01)makes their capital, but which no other writer names.On the great road from Italy into the N. of Spain,reckoning from Tarraco, stood Ilehda, 62 M. P.;Tolous, 32 M. P., in the oonventus of Cacsar-augusta, and with the civitas Roinana(PIin.); Per-Tt sA, 18 M. P. (Pertusa, on the Alcanadre); Osca,19 M. P., whence it was 4G M. P. to Cae&araugusta{iiiu. Ant. p. 391). On a loop of the same road, starting fromCaesaraugusta, were: — Gallictm, 15 M. P., onthe river Gallicus (Zunra, on the Galltf/o);Boutin ae, 18 M. P. (BouprtVo, Ptol.: Tori-no*); Osca, 12 M.P.; Cai-s, 29 M. P.; Mem>i-cci.eia, 19 M. P. (probably Mrmzon); Ilekda,22 M. P. (/tin. Ant. pp. 451, 452). On the roadfrom Caesaraugusta, up the valley of the Gallicus,to Benearnum (Ort/tes) in Gallia, were, Foiii'MGallokum, 30 M. P. (Guirea), and Ekklllnum,22 M. P. (/kilo), whence it was 24 M. P. to the sum­mit of the pass over the Pyrenees (Itin.Ant. p.452).Besides these places, Ptolemy mentions Bkrgi siaBtpyovata: Bahvjuer), on the Sieoris; Bkrgidl'.m(BtpytHov); Erg A ("Epya); Succosa (SovKKuaa);Gallic a Flavia (raAAuca 4>Aaou/a: Fragaf);and Orgia (Tipnla, prob. Orgagna), a name alsofound on coins (Sestini, Med. fsp. p. 99), whilethe same coins bear the name of Aesones, and in­scriptions found near the Sieoris have Aesonensisand Jessonensis (Muratori, Nov. Thts. p. 1021,Nos. 2, 3; Spoil, Misc. Kind. Ant. p. 188), withwhich the Gessoriknses of Pliny may perhapshave some connection. Bkksical is mentioned oncoins (Sestini, p. 107), and Octogesa (prob. LaGranja, at the confluence of the Segre and theEbro) by Caesar (B. C. i. Gl ; t'kert, vol. ii. pt. 1.pp. 450—453). [P. S.] ILE'SIUM. [Eileml'M.] IXICI or IL'LICI (/tin. Ant. p. 401 ; 'WtKiast) 'IAAiki'i, Ptol. ii. 6. § 62: Elche), an inland cityof the Contestani, but near the coast, on which ithad a port t^WKiKiravhs \ifiyv, Ptol. /. c. § 14),lying just in the middle of tin* bay formed by thePr. Saturni and Dlanium, which was called Illici-tanus Sinus. The city itself stood at the distanceof 52 M. P. from Carthago Nova, on the great roadto Tarraco (/tin. Ant. p. 401), and was a Cofoniaimmunif. with the jus /talicum (Plin. iii. 3, s. 4;Paulas, Dig. viii. de Cens.). Its coins are extantof tlie period of the empire (Florez, Med. de Egp.vol. ii. p. 458; Sestini, p. 166; Mionnet, vol. i.p. 45, SuppL vol. i. p. 90; Eckhel, vol. i. p. 51).Pliny adds to his mention of the place: in earncontributtniur /cogitani. (Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. pp.402. 403.) [P. S.] ILIENSES ('IAi€7s, Paus), a people of the inte­rior of Sardinia, who appear to have been one of themost considerable of the mountain tribes in thatisland. Mela calls them "antiquissimi in ea popu-lorum," and Pliny also mentions them among the"celeberrimi populorum" of Sardinia. (Mel. ii. 7.§ 19; Plin. iii. 7. s. 13.) Pausanias, who termsthem *IAi«if, distinctly ascribes to them a Trojanorigin, and derives them from a portion of the com­ panions of Aeneas, who settled in the island, ardremained there in quiet until they were compelledby the Africans, who subsequently occupied thecoasts of Sardinia, to lake refuge in the more ruggedand inaccessible mountain districts of the interior.; (Paus. x. 17. § 7.) This tale has evidently ori-1 ginated in tiie resemblance of the name of Uienses, inthe form which the Romans pave it, to that of the\ Tmjans; and the latter part of the story was in­vented to account for the apparent anomaly of apeople that had come by sea dwelling in the interiorof the island. What the native name of the 11 lenseswas. we know not, and we are wholly in the dark asto their real origin or ethnical affinities: but theirexistence as one of the most considerable trills <»fthe interior at the period of the Iioman conquest, iswell ascertained ; and they are repeatedly mentionedby Livy as contending against the. supremacy ofHome. Their first insurrection, in u.r. 181, wasrepressed, rather than put down, by the praetorM.Finarius; and in B.C. 1 78, the Uienses and Balari,in conjunction, laid waste all the more fertile andsettled parts of the island; anil were even able tomeet the consul Ti.Sempronius Gracchus in a pitche 1battle, in which, however, they were defeated withheavy loss. In the course of the following yearthey appear to have been reduced to complete sub­mission; and their name is not again mentioned inhistory. (Liv. xl. 19,34, xli. 6. 12, 17.) The situation and limits of the territory occupiedby the Uienses, cannot be determined: but we hudthem associated with the Balari and Oorrd, as inha­biting the central and mountainous districts of theisland. Their name is not found in Ptolemy, thoughhe gives a long list of the tribes <>f the interior. Many writers have identified the Uienses with thelolaenses or lolai, who are also placet! in the interiorof Sardinia; and it, is not improbable that they werereally the same people, but ancient authors certainlymake a distinction between the two.

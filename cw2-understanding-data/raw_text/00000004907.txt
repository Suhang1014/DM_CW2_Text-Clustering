[3] Some supposed him -oddly enough to be rtbastard of the younger Gordian. Others took ad-vant?ge of the province of Dardania, to deduce hisorigin from Dardanas, and the ancient kings ofTroy. [4] Noterta, a periodical and official dispatch■which the Emperors received from the frvmentariior agents dispersed through the provincts. Of thesewe may speak hereafter. ^5] Hist. August, p. 208. Gallienus describes theplate, vestments, &c. like a man, who loved and■understood those splendid trifles. [6] Julian (Orat. i. p. 6 ) affirms that Claudiusacquired the empire in a just and even holy manner.But we may distrust the partiality of a kinsman. [7] Hist. August, p. 203. There are some triflingdifferences concerning the circumstances of the lastdefeat and death of Aureolus. [8] Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The peopleloudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. 1 hesenate decreed that his relations and servants shouldbe thrown down headlong from the Gemonianstairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had hiteyes torn out whilst under examination. [9] Zonaras, I. xii. p. 137. [10] Zonaras on this occasion mentions Posthu-mus; but the registers of the senate (Hist. August,p. 203.) prove that Tetricus was already emperorof the western provinces.

[17] Theoclius (as quoted in the AugustanHistory, p. 211.) affirms, that in one day he killed,with his own hand, forty-eight Sarmatians, and inseveral subsequent engagements nine hundred andfifty. This heroic valour was admired by the sol­diers, and celebrated in their rude songs, the bur­den of which was milk, mille, milk occidit. [18] Acholius (ap. Hist. August, p. 213.) de­scribes the ceremony of the adoption, as it was per­formed at Byzantium, in the presence of the em­peror and his great Officers. [19] Hist. August, p. 211. This laconic epistleis truly the work of a soldier; it abounds withmilitary phrases and words, some of which can­not be understood without difficulty.

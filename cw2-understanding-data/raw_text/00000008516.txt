[Scardus.]SCOTANE. [Clkitob, p. 633, a.]SCOTI. The Scoti were tbe ancient inhabitantsof Hibemia, as appears from notices in some of theLatin writers. (Claudian, delV. Cons. Honor. 33,de Laud. StiL ii. 251; Oroa. i. 2.) For severalcenturies Ireland was considered as the land of theScoti, and the name of Scotia was equivalent to thatof Hibernia. (Isid. Orig. xiv. 6; Beda, i. 1, ii. 4;Gcogr. Rav. i. 3, v. 32; Alfred the Great, up. Oros.p. 30, &c.) We have no accounts respecting tbesubdivisions of the Scoti; but perhaps they are tobe sought in the names of the Irish counties, asA/nutter, Leinster, Ulster, Comtaught. Ammianusmentions the Scoti, in conjunction with the Atta-cotti, as committing formidable devastations (xxvii.8. § 4). According to St Jerome (ooV. Jovin.v. 2. 201, ed. Mart.) they had their wives incommon; a custom which Dion Cassius represents asalso prevailing among the kindred race in Caledonia(Ixxvi. 12). At a later period the names of Scotiaand Scoti vanish entirely from Ireland, and becomethe appellations of the neighbouring Caledonia andits inhabitants. This was effected through a mi­gration of the Scoti into Caledonia, who settled tothe N. of the Clyde; but at what lime this hap-pened, cannot be ascertained. Beda (i. 1) statesthat it took place under a leader called Reuda. Thenew settlement waged war with the surroundingPicts, and even against the Anglo-Saxons, but atfirst with little success. (Id. i. 24, iv. 36.) Ul­timately, however, in the year 839, under kingKeneth, they succeeded in subduing the Picts(Fordun, Scot. Hist. ap. Gale, i. 659, seq.); and thewhole country N. of Solway Frith subsequentlyobtained the name of Scotland. (Comp.

(Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii.p. 227.) [E.B.J.] SCOTUSSA (SicoToSirffa or Zxorowra: Eth.XKOTOveaaios), an ancient town of Pelasgiotis inThessaly, lying between Pherae and Pharsalus, nearthe frontiers of Phthiotis. Scotussa is not men­tioned in Homer, but according to some accountsthe oracle of Doduna in Epeirus originally camefrom this place. (Strab. vii. p. 329.) In n. c. 394the Scotussaei joined the other Thessalians in op­posing the march of Agesilaus through their country.(Xen. Hell. iv. 3. § 3.) In u. c. 367 Scotnssa wastreacherously seized by Alexander, tyrant of theneighbouring town of Pherae. (Diod. xv. 75.) Inthe territory of Scotussa were the hills calledCynoscepbalae, which are memorable as the scene oftwo battles, one fought in B. c. 364, between theThebans and Alexander of Pherae, in which Pe-lopidas was slain, and the other, of still greatercelebrity, fought in B.C. 197, in which the lastPhilip of Macedonia was defeated by the Romanconsul Flamininus. (Plut. Pelop. 32; Strab. ix. p.441; Polyb. xviii. 3, seq.; Liv. xxxiii. 6, seq.) InB. c 191 Scotussa surrendered to Antiochus, butwas recovered shortly afterwards, along with l'hai-salus and Pherae, by the consul Acilius. (Lir.xxxvi. 9, 14.) The ruins of Scotussa are found at 3 o 3

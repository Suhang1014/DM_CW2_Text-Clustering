In a sandy and arid country thesewere necessarily few, so that there are not more thansix or seven that can be clearly identified with ancientsites. Among these Musa still exists under its an­cient name unchanged (lb. pp. 238, 239. 284) atthe required distance from the Straits of Hnb-tl-Manddi, via. 300 stadia, reckoning 500 stadia to adegree, (lb. pp. 2G9, 270.) Vincent makes itshort of 40 miles. {Pwiphis, p. 319.) In themiddle ages when the sea had already retired fromMusa, another town named Mottle or Mauridjw*sbuilt as a seaport in its stead, which seems to haveusurped the name of the more ancient town, and tohave been mistaken for it by some geographers. ThisMosek still exists, in its turn abandoned by the sea;but about 25' north of the true position of Musa.(Ib. p. 270.) "The mart of Yemen at the presentday is Mokha. . . . Twenty miles inland fromMokha Niebuhr discovered a Moo.ni still existing,which he with great probability supposes to be theancient mart, now carried inland to this distance bythe recession of the coast." (Vincent, /. c. p.315.)There is a circumstance mentioned by Ilruce of theroadstead of Mokha, which coincides with a state­ment cited from Arrian with regard to Muza.

It is an ordinary village, badly built, onlyrecommended by its water, which is drunk by thewealthier inhabitants of Mokha.

It runs out into the sea just oppo­site the island of Samoa, from which it is separatedonly by a narrow channel seven stadia in breadth. Itwas in this channel, and on the mainland at the footof Mount Mycale, that the Persians were defeated,in h. c. 479. It is probable that at the foot ofMount Mycale there was a town called Mycale orMycalleasua, for Stephanas Byx. (*. v.) and Scylax(p. 37) speak of a town of Mycale in Caria orLydia. The whole range of Mount Mycale nowbears the name of Sanunm. (Horn. 77. ii.

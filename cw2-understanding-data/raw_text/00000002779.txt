Now the af­fection of the multitude towards Simon was so great, that intheir contracts one with another, and in the public records, theywrote, "In the first year of Simon the benefactor and ethnarch"of the Jews:" for under him they were very happy, and over­came the enemies that were round about them, for Simon over­threw the city Gazara, and Joppa, and Jamnia. Pie also tookthe citadel of Jerusalem by siege, and cast it down to the ground,that it might not be any more a place of refuge to their enemieswhen they took it, to do them a mischief, as it had been till now.And when he had done this, he thought it their best way, andmost for their advantage, to level the very mountain itself uponwhich the citadel happened to stand, that so the temple mightbe higher than it.

What few thingsthere are afterward common to both, might probably be learned by him from someother more imperfect records. However, we must exactly observe here, what the re­maining part of that book of the Maccabeus informs us of, and what Josephus wouldnever have omitted, had his copy contained so much, that this Simon the Great, theMaccabee, made a league with Amiochus Soter, the son of Demetrius Soter, and bro­ther of the other Demetrius, who was now a captive in Parthia, that upon his corr.i 115VOL.

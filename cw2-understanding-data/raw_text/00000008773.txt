Servius had formed the different Vici intoreligious corporations somewhat analogous with ourparishes, with an appointed worship of the Lares,and proper feasts or Compitalia. During the Re­public these corporations became a kind of politicaltlubs, and were often made the engines of designingdemagogues. (Preller. Hegionett, p. 81.) Au­gustus, in his new distribution, also adopted thescheme of embodying the Vici as religious corpora­tions, and for this purpose erected chapels in thecross ways, and set up images of the gods ricat'mi, asthe Apollo Sandaliarius and the Jupiter Tragoedus.(Suet. Aug. ."j7.) Many bases of these statues havel>cen discovered. By the term Vicus we are tounderstand a certain collection of houses insulatedby streets running round all its sides; whence theterm came also to be applied to the streets themselves(" altera vici appellantur. cum id genus aedificiorumdefinitur, quae continent ia sunt in oppidis, qua eveitineribus regionihusqne distribute inter se distant,nominibusque dissitnilibus discriminis causa suntdispartita" Fest. p. 371, et ibi Miill). Compitnm,which means properly a cross-road, was also,especially in ancient times, only another name forVicus; and thus we rind Pliny describing Romeas divided into Compita Larum instead of Vici (in.9). The Vici and Compita. regarded as streets,were narrrower than the Viae and Plateae. (Suet.Aug. 45; Amin. Marc, xxviii. 4. $ 29.) They werenamed after temples and other objects. The Viciwere composed of two classes of houses called respec­tively insulae and domus. The former were so calledbecause, by a law of the XII. Tables, it was ordainedthat they should be separated from one another by aninterval of 2^ feet, called ambUm, and by later authorsciradtus (Varr. L.L. v. § 22, Miill; Paul. Diac. p.Hi, 111 Miill.) This law, which seems to have beendeigned for purposesof health and for security againstfire, was disregarded during the Republic, but againenforced by Nero when he rebuilt the city (Tac. Ann.xv. 43); and there is an ordinance on the subject byAntoninus and Verus{Dig. viii. 2. 14). By insulae,therefore, we an' to understand single houses dividedby a small space from the neighbouring ones, nota complex of houses divided by streets. The latterdivision formed a Vicus. Yet some insulae were solarge and deposed in such a manner that they almostresembled Vici (vide Feat p. 371. et ibi Midi).The insulae wen- inhabited by the middling and lowerclasses, and were generally let out in floors ("coena-cula meritoria," Dig. xix. 2. 30). It appears fromthe same authority that they were farmed by personswho underlet tliem; but sometimes the proprietorskept stewards to collect their rents. Insulae werenamed after their owners, who were called ''dominiinsularum" (Suet. Cars. 41. Tib. 48). Thus webear of the insula Eucarpiana, Critonia, Arriana,Sec. (vide Grater, 611. 13 ; Murat. 948. 9.) Kentwas high (Juv. iii. 166), and investments in housesconsequently profitable, though hazardous, since theprinciple of insurance was altogether unknown.(Gel), xv. 1, 2.) Crassus was a great speculator inhouses, and was said to possess nearly hall Koine.(1*1 at. c. 2.) The domus, on the contrary, were thehabitations or palaces of the rich and great, andconsequently much fewer in number than the insulae,the proportion in each Region being as 1 to 2o or 30.The domus were also common!)' insulated, but not byany special law, like the insulae.

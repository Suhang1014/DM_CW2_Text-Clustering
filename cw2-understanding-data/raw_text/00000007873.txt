As to tin' history of this city, we knowthat Philip of Macedonia, tin* son of Demetrius, en­deavoured in vain to obtain |>ossession of it; and itwas probably to reward the place for its oppositionto him that tin1 Romans, alter the war with Anti-uchu*, declared its citizens free (I*«lyb. xvi. '24, xxii.27; Liv, xxxviii. 39). In a petty war with theneighbouring Euromian*, the M\Ia-saus were vic­torious, and took some of their towns; hut wereafterwards compelled to submit to the Ithodians( Polyb. ,\xx. 5; Liv. xiv. 2.").) In the time of Strabo,the town appears to liavc been still flom islam', andtwo eminent orators, Euthydeinus and Hybrens,exercised considerable influence over their fellow-citizens. Hybreas, however, incurred the enmity ofLnbiemts, bis political adversary, whose pretensionslie tried to re-ist. But he was obliged to take refugein Rhodes; whereupon Lahienus marched witharmy against Mylassa, and did great damage to thetown. (Strab.xiv.p.660.) It mentioned,however,as late as the time of Hieroeles (p. GSS). It is ge­nerally admitted that the site of the ancient Mylassais marked l.y the modem .1/' fttsso or Mthtwi, whereconsiderable ancient remains have been observed bytravellers. A temple, erected by the people of My­lassa in honour of Augustus and Roma, considerableruins of which bad existed until modern times, wasdestroyed about the middle ,.f last centtiry by theTurks, who built a new moMjne with the materials(Pococke, Tranh, torn. ii. p. 2. c. f>.)

It was Iprotected by strong walls, and had a good harbour.(Paus. ii. 3*0. § S; St rah. xiv. p. 058; Arrian, A nab. ,i. 20, ii. 5 ) But otherwise the place is not of Jmuch importance in ancient history. Both Pliny(v. 20) and Ntephauus L»y/.. (s. r.) mention Paine- ,myndus as a place close by Myndus; and this pa-laemyndus seems to have been the ancient place ofthe Carians which became deserted after the esta­blishment of the Dorian Myndus. (Comp. Strah. xiii.p. 61 1.) Mela (i. ]('») and Pliny (/. c.) also speakof a place called Neapolis in the same peninsula; andas no other authors mention such a place in thatpart of the country, it lias been supposed thatMyndus (The Dorian colony) and Neapolis were the | same place.

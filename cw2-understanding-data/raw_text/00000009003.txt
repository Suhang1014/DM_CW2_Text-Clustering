Dubois de Montpcrreux( Voyage Autour du Caurare, vol. v. p. 389, vol. vt pp.220,378) has identified this place with the ruinsfound at Kermentchik near Simpheropol. [E. B. J.]NEA'POLIS. II. In Asia. 1. An importantcity of Palaestine, commonly supposed to be identicalwith the Sichem or Shechem of the Old Testament.Thus Epiphanius uses the names as synonymous{iv ^ixlfwis, tout' lariv iv ttj vvv\ NfawdAfi, adv.Uaeres.lib. iii. torn. i.p. 1055,comp.l068). Eusebiusand St. Jerome, however, place Sichem (Sochxa,2uKru, 2ux*") in the suburbs of Neapolis ( Onommt.s. vv. Terebinthus, Sychein); and Luz is placed nearto, and, according to the former, viii. M. P., accordingto the latter, iii. M. P., from Neapolis (». v. Aoufa),which would imply a considerable interval betweenthe ancient and the modern city. In order to re­concile this discrepancy, Reland suggests that whilethe ancient city gradually decayed, the new city wasextended by gradual accretion in the opposite direc­tion, so as to widen the interval ; and he cites inillustration the parallel case of Utrecht and Yeehten.{Palaestina, pp. 1004, 1005,) Another ancientname of this city occurs only in one passage ofSt. John's Gospel (iv. 5), where it is called Sichar(2ix°V); for although St. Jerome maintains this tobe a corrupt rending for Sychem (Epitaph. Pauhie,Ep. lxxxvL Op. torn. iv. p. 676, Quaest. in Genes.c xlviii. ver. 22, torn ii. p. 545), his correction ofwhat he allows was an ancient and common error,even in his age, has no authority in any known codexor version. Another of its ancient names which hasexercised the ingenuity of the learned, occurs inPliny, who reckons among the cities of Samaria,'* Neapolis quod antea Mamortha dicebatur" (v. 13),evidently a mistake for Mabortha, which Josephusgives for the native name of Neapolis {B. J. iv. 8.§ 2); unless, as Keland conjectures, both readingsare to be corrected from coins, which he shrewdly re­marks are less liable to corruption than MSS., andwhich read Morthia (Mopflfo), which that learnedwriter takes to be the classical form of the Hebrewword Moreh, which was associated with Sichem, bothin the Old Testament and the Rabbinical commen­taries. {Gen. xii. 6; Bent. xi. 30; Keland, Disser-tatiunes Miscell. pars L pp. 138 — 140.) The samewriter explains the name Sichar, in St. John, as aname of reproach, contemptuously assigned to thecity by the Jews as the seat of error (the Hebrew*lfcS? signifying mendacium, fakum), and borrowedfrom the prophet Habakkuk, where the two wordsMoreh Shaker Qgtf' HDD) occur in convenient

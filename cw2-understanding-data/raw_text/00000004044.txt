The two only other writers whom we know of,whence such Jewish affairs might be supposed to be taken byTacitus, who never appears to have been in Judca himself,are Justus of Tiberias, a Jewish historian, contemporarywith Josephus, and one Antonius Julianus, once mentionedby Minutius Felix in his Octavius, sect. 33, as having writtenon the same subject with Josephus, and both already menÂ­tioned by me on another occasion, Dissert.

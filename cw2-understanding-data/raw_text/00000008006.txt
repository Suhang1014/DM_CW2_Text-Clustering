He theresjient the remaining eighteen years of his life, whilethe throne of the Marcoinanni was left to Catualda,[Diet, ofliiorjr. art. Maroboihcs.] But the latter,too, was soon exj>elled by the Hcrmunduri, and endedhis life in exile. (Tac. Ann. ii. 62, 63.) The Mar-comanni, however, like the Quadi, continued to begoverned by kincs of their own, though they werenot quite independent of the Romans, who often sup-j>orte«l them with money and more rarely with troops.(Tac. Germ. 42.) They appear to have graduallyextended their dominion to the hanks of the Danube,where they came into hostile collision with theRomans. The emperor Domitian demanded theirassi stance against the Dacians, and this being re­fused, he made war against them. But he wasdefeated a. v. 90, and obliged to make peace withthe Dacians. (Dion Cass, lxvii. 7.) Trajan andHadrian kept them in check; but in the reign ofM. Aurelius humilities were recommenced with freshenergy. The Marcomanni, allied with the Quadi andothers, partly from hatred of the Itomans,and partlyurged on by other tribes pressing upon them in thenorth and east, invaded the Roman provinces a. d.166; and thus commenced the protracted war com­monly called the Marcomannic or German War, whichlasted until the accession of Commodus, a. d. 180,who purchased peace of them. During this war,the Marcomanni and their confederates advanced intoKhaetia, and even penetrated as far as Aquilcia.The war was not carried on uninterruptedly, but wasdivided into two distinct contests, having been inter­rupted by a peace or truce, in which the places con­quered on both sides were restored. The second warbroke out towards the end of the reign of M. Aurelius,about a. d. 178. (Dion Cass. Vragm. lib. lxxi.,Ixxii., lxxvii. pp. 1178, foil., 1305, ed. Reimar.;Kutrop. viii. 6; J. Capitol. M. Anton. Philos. 12,&c, 17,21,22, 25, 27; Amm. Marc. xix. 6; He-rodian, i. init.) In consequence of the pusillanimityof Commodus the Marcomannians were so much em­boldened, that, soon after and throughout the thirdcentury, they continued their inroads into theRoman provinces, especially Rhaetia and Noricum.In the reign of Aurvlian, they penetrated into Italy,even as far as Ancona, and excited great alarm atBorne. (Vopisc. Aurtl. 18,21.) But afterwards theycease to act a prominent part in history. Theirname, however, is still mentioned occasionally, as inJornandes (22), who sijeaks of them as dwelling onthe west of Transylvania. (Comp. Amm. Marc.xxii. 5, xxix. 6, xxxi. 4.) In the Notitia Iin]>erii, wehave mention of '* Honoriani Marcomanni scniures"and "juniorcs" among the Roman auxiliaries. Thelast occasion on which their name occurs is in thehistory of Attila, among whose hordes Marcomanniare mentioned. (Comp.

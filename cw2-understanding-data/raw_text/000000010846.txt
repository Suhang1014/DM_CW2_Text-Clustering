When they were called to silence, the consul"highly extolled the good fortune of his colleague who"after the delivery of his country had fallen in the"greatest honour, fighting for its liberty, when his glory"was at its height, and before it was sullied by the foul"touches of envy: whilst himself had survived the glory"he had acquired, to become the but of envy and cri-"minal impeachments, and from being esteemed the"deliverer of his country, had his character now level-"led with that of the Vitellii and Aquilei. Shall there"never be a time," says'he, " that virtue will be so fully"approved by you, as to be proof against jealousy? Is"it possible, that I, who have shown myself an implac­able enemy to kings, should have reason to fear, thatever a charge of aspiring to regal power, would belaid against myself? Were I to live in the capitd,nay, in the citadel itself, could I ever imagine, that Ishould become formidable to my fellow citizens? Doesmy character among you depend on circumstances sotrifling? Is your confidence in me so slightly founded,that you should rather be concerned about the situa­tion of my house, than the conduct of my life? But,gentlemen, the house of Publius Valerius shall neverobstruct your liberty. No longer be afraid of Velia.I will not only bring down my house into the plain,but even build it at the foot of the hill, that you maydwell above me, a suspected citizen. Permit those tobuild upon Velia, whom you think more worthy to beentrusted with your liberty, than Publius Valerius."All the materials were accordingly brought down tothe valley below Velia, and his house was built atthe foot of the hill, where the temple of Victory nowstands.

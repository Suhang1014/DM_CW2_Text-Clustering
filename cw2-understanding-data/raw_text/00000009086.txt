This tribe were settled upon the wholeof the great mountain Orbelus, extending along theNE. of the lower Strymonic plain, from about Mele-niko and Demirissdr to Zildina inclusive, wherethey bordered on Pangaeus, the gold and silvermines of which they wurked with the Pieres andSatrae. (Herod. L c.) Secure in their inacces­sible position, they defied Megabazns. (Herod, v.16.) The NW. portion of their territory lay to theright of Sitalces as he crossed Mt. Cercine; andtheir general situation agrees with the description ofThueydides (ii. 101), according to whom they dweltbeyond the Strymon to the N., that is to say, to theN. of the Lower Strymon, where, alone, the rivertakes such a course to the E. as to justify the expres­sion. Cleon invited Polles, their chieftain, to joinhim with as many Thxacian mercenaries as could belevied. (Thuc. v. 6; Aristoph.

(Herod, iv. 92.)Their territory, however, must undoubtedly haveextended considerably to the \V. of the Artiscus;since Pliny (iv. 18) informs us that the Hebrushad its source in their country; a fact that is cor­roborated by Ammianus Marccllinus (xxvii. 4, 10).They appear to have belonged to that northernswarm of barbarians which invaded Thrace afterthe Trojan War; and their names are often foundinterwoven in the ancient myths. Thus the Thra-cian singer Thamyris is said to have been anOdrysian (Paus. iv. 33. § 4); and Orpheus isrepresented as their king. (Conon, ap. rho(.p. 140.)

[Castra, Vol. I. p. 562, a.]NIC1UM or N1C1U (lWoi» iititdiSwoAis, Ptol.it. 5. § 9), a principal town in the Nomos Praso-pites of Lower Aegypt, lay just above Momemphisand nearly midway between Memphis and Alex­andras. It was one of the military stations on themain road between those cities which ran nearlyparallel with the Canonic arm of the Nile. [Pnoso-rtra] [W. B. D.] KICOMEDEIA (Nutoaftfeia: Eth. Nncojuj5«ur:laitmid or Ismid), the capital of Bithynia, situatedon the north-eastern coast of the Sinus Astacenus, apart of the Propontis. The town of Astacus, a little tothe .south-east of Nicomedeia, was destroyed, or greatlydamaged, by Lysimachus; and some time after, B.C.264, Xicomedes I. built the town of Nicomedeia, towhich the inhabitants of Astacus were transferred(Steph. B.«. r.; Strab. xii. p. 563; Paus. v. 12. § 5;Euseb. Ckron. 01. 129. 1). The founder of the newcity made it the capital of his kingdom, and in aabort time it became one of the largest and mostflourishing cities, and continued to prosper for morethan six centuries. Pliny, in his letters to the em­peror Trajan, mentions several public buildings of thecity, such as a senate-house, an aqueduct, a forum,a temple of Cybele, &c., and speaks of a great fire,daring which the place suffered much (Epist. x. 42,46). Respecting its rivalry with Nicaea, see Ni-CUa. According to Pliny (v. 43), Nicomedeia was62} miles to the south-east of Chalcedon, while ac­cording to others it was only 60 or 61 miles distant(/(..4«tpp. 124, 140; It. Ilieros. p. 572; Tab.Prut) Under the Roman Empire Nicomedeia wasoften the residence of the emperors, such as Diocle­tian and Constantine, especially when they were en-raced in war against the Parthians or Persians.(AnreL Viet, de Cats. 39; Nicephor. vii. in fin.)The city often suffered from earthquakes, but owingto the munificence of the emperors it was always re­stored (Amm. Marc. xvii. 7; Philostorg. iv. p. 506).It also suffered much from an invasion of the Scy­thians (Amm. Marc xxii. 9, 12, 13). The oratorLibanius {Oral. 62, torn. iii. p. 337, ed. Reiskc)imams the loss of its thermae, basilicae, temples,f jmnasia, schools, public gardens, &c, some of whichwere afterwards restored by Justinian (Procop. deAeH.v. 1; comp. PtoLv. 1. §3, viii.17. §4; Hierocl.p. 691). From inscriptions we lcam that in the later com or xicour.DEiA period of the empire Nicomedeia enjoyed the honourof a Roman colony (Orelli, Inscript. No. 1060). Thecity is also remarkable as being the native place ofArrian, the historian of Alexander the Great, and asthe place where Hannibal put an end to his che­quered life. Constantine breathed his last at hisvilla Ancyron, near Nicomedeia (Cassiod. Ckron.Const.; Philostorg. ii. p. 484).

Hudson; Tovtxri, Ptol. iv.7. § 11; Ni'ki, Ptol. i. 17. § 12), one of the"Runs" of Azania, on the E. coast of Africa, seven(days' stations) in all. Passing the Noti Cornu ofPtolemy (ELKhail), the voyager arrived at the"Strands" (acyioAof), the Little and the Great,extending six days according to the Periplus, eightaccording to Ptolemy's authorities, though he wouldreduce the distance to four natural days. The LittleStrand, which occurs first, is doubtless the SelfTawil, or H Long Sword," of the Arab pilots, socalled from its curvature. The Great Strand isprobably the district now called Merit, "DryDesert." These have an extent of 300 miles. Nextcomes the peopled shore where Ptolemy (i. 17. § 11)places 3 towns, Essina ("Eaoipa), the SakapioxisPortus (SapawiWos Spuor), and Tonice or Nici,the Nicon of the Periplus. These towns must lieplaced in the Bara Somauli, or the land of theSomauli, or Shumdli, a mild people of pastoral ha­bits, confined to the coast, which they occupy fromthe Red Sea to the river Jvba. The "Port of Sa-rapion" corresponds with Markah, while the"Run of Nicon" agrees with the point called Torrein Owen's map.

J.] NICO'NIUM (NimSiw, Scylax, p. 29), a city ofEuropean Sarmatia, which Strabo (vii. p. 306) placesat 180 stadia from the mouth of the Tyras, whilethe anonymous Coast-describer (p. 9) fixes it at300 stadia from the Isiacorum Portus, and 30stadia from the Tyras on the coast. Stephanusof Byzantium (*. p.) states that it was at tlio mouthof the later, but for "\arpov, Tvpou should probablybe read. Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 16) has removed it fromthe coast, and placed it too far to the N. Its posi­tion must be looked for near Oridiopol. [E. B.J.] NICO'POLIS (NiiedVoAu : Eth.

(Strab. xii.p. 555; Appian, Mithrid. 101, 105 j Dion Cass.xxxv. 33; Cacs. Bell. Alex. 36; Plin. vi. 10.) Itwas situated in a valley of the river Lycus, a tribu-taiy of the Iris (*4c(a Martyr, torn. iii. Jul. p. 46),at a distance of 100 miles to the north-west of Sa-tala, and 98 to the north-east of Sebastia. It wasa populous town as early as the time of Strabo; butduring the hist period of the Empire it appears to havesuffered much, and its decayed walls were restored byJustinian.

Thecolumns were 17 feet high, including the capital,2 feet 10 inches in diameter at the base, with anopening between them of 8 feet 8 inches." (TheDemi of Attica, p. 6.3. 2nd fed.) Leake remarksthat there are no traces of any third building visible,and that we must therefore conclude that here, asin the temple of Athena Polias at Athens, Poseidonwas honoured only with an aha:', Wordsworth,however, remarks that a little to the NK. of thepeninsula on which the temple stands is a conicalhill, where are extensive vestiges of an ancientbuilding, which may perhaps be the remains of thetemple of Poseidon.

OCR Output PREFACE. The Natural History of Pliny has been alwaysregarded as one of the most precious remains of anti足quity. I conceive, therefore, that it will be unnecessaryfor me to make any observations, either on the value ofthe original, or on the addition that our literature wouldreceive from a correct translation of it. It may be suffi足cient to remark, that it will enable us to learn the stateboth of the sciences and of the arts among the Romans,and to ascertain the progress which they had made inthe knowledge of nature. My object in the proposed work is to present theEnglish reader with a faithful translation, and to give it,as much as possible, in the style of the original. Thatthis is an undertaking of some difficulty every one willadmit, who is acquainted with the variety of topics onwhich the author treats, and with the mode in which heconveys his information. Partly owing to the imperfectstate of the manuscripts, and partly depending on thenature of the subject, we are frequently at a loss todevelope the meaning of the author, and where we havenot this obstacle to contend against, it is often difficult totransfer the meaning into our language, without destroy足ing the air of the original. With respect to notes and illustrations, it is not easyfor a translator to prescribe to himself the correct methodwhich he ought to pursue. Without some assistance ofthis kind, the text would be often unintelligible; and yetto give all that might be appended in the way of com足mentary would lead to an endless accumulation of matter. B 2

The Goths,who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian had felt the weightof the Roman arms, respected the power of the empire, even in themidst of its intestine divisions. But the strength of that warlikenation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years; a newgeneration had arisen, who no longer remembered the misfortunesof ancient days: the Sarmatians of the lake Maeotis followed theGothic standard either as subjects or as allies, and their unitedforce was poured upon the countries of Illyricum. Campona,Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of severalmemorable sieges and battles"; and though Constantine en­countered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed at length in the, contest, and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominiousretreat by restoring the booty aad prisoners which they had taken.Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of theemperor. He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barba­rians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the headof his legions he passed the Danube, on the bridge which had beenconstructed by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest recestes ofDacia *co, and when he had inflicted a severe revenge, condescendedi to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on condition that, as oftenas they were required, they mould supply his armies with a bodyof forty thousand soldiers "".

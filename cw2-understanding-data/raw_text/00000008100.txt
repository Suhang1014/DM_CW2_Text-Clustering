Of the national character of the Samnites welearn little more than that they were extremelybrave and warlike, and had inherited to a great de­gree the frugal and simple habits of their ancestorsthe Sabines. We find also indications that they re­tained the strong religious or superstitious feelingsof the Sabines, of which a striking instance is givenby I,ivy in the rites and ceremonies with which theyconsecrated the troops that they levied in it. c. 293.(Liv. x. 38.) But they had almost ceased to exist asa nation in the days of the Latin poets and writersthat are preserved to us; and hence we cannotwonder that their name is seldom alluded to. Theyare said to have dwelt for the most part, like theSabines, in open villages; but it is evident, fromtile accounts of their earliest wars with the Komans,that they possessed towns, and some of them, atleast, strongly fortified. This is confirmed, by theremains of walls ol a very ancient style of construc­tion, which are still pre^ierved at Ai-sernia and Bo-vianum, and still more remarkably at Aufidena.(Abeken, Mittel Jtalitn, pp. 142, 148.) But fromthe very nature of their country the Sainnites mustalways have been, to a great extent, a rude andpastoral people, and had probably received only ataint tinge of civilisation, through their intercoursewith the Campanians and Apulians. III. Topography. The rivers of the Samnite territory have beenalready noticed in connection with the mountainchains and groups in wliich they take their rise.From the purely inland character of the region, noneof these rivers, with the exception of the Calor andits tributaries, belong wholly to Samnium, but tra­verse the territories of other nations before theyreach the sea. Thus the Sagrus and Trinius, afterquitting the mountains of Samnium, flow throughthe land of the Frentani to the Adriatic; the TUfernus separates the territory of that people fromApulia, while the Frento and the Aufidus traverse theplains of Apulia. On the other side of the centralchain the Vulturnus, with its affluent the Calor,and the tributaries of the latter, the Sabatus andTainarus*. carry down the whole of the waters ofthe Apennines of Samnium, which flow to the Tyr­rhenian sea. The tojmgraphy of Samnium is the most obscureand confu.Ncd of any [>art of Italy. The reason ofthis is obvious. From the continued wars whichhad devastated the country; and the state of deso­lation to which it was reduced in the time of thegeographers, only a few towns had survived, atleast in such a state as to be deemed worthy of no­tice by them; and many of the names mentioned byLivy and other authors during the early wars of theRomans with the Sainnites never reappear at a laterperiod. It is indeed probable that some of thesewere scarcely towns in the stricter sense of the term,but merely fortified villages or strongholds, in whichthe inhabitants collected their cattle and propertyin time of war. Those which are mentioned by thegeographers as still existing under the Roman Em­pire, or the site of wliich is clearly indicated, may bebriefly enumerated. Aufidkna, in the upper valleyof the Sagrus, is the only town that can be assignedwith any certainty to the Caraccni. In the uppervalley of the Vulturnus was Aeskrnia, the terri- I tory of which bordered on tint of Yaafnr aCampania.

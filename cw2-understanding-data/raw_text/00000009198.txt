(Tat Eitt. iv. 53; Suet ceip.8; Dion Cass.Ixvi. 10, &c.) The new build­ing, however, stood but for a very short period. Itwas again destroyed soon after Vespasian's deathin a great fire which particularly desolated the9th Region, and was rebuilt bj Domitian with asplendour hitherto unequalled. (Suet. Dom. 15;Dion Cass. Ixvi. 24.) Nothing further is accuratelyknown of its history; but Domitian's structureseems to have lasted till a very late period of theEmpire.

(Liv. xxii. 10, xxiii. 51; Cic. A'. /'- ii.23.) A temple of Venus Cafitolina and VenusVictrix are also mentioned, but it is not clearwhether they were separate edifices. (Suet. Cai. 7,Galb. 18; Fiut. Amit. Fill. Id. Oct.) We also hearof two temples of Jupiteb (Liv. xxxv. 41), and atemple of Ops (xxxix. 22). It by no means follows,however, that all these temples were on the Capitol,properly so called, and some of them might havebeen on the other BUmmit, Capitolium being usedgenerally as the name of the hill. This seems tohave been the case with the temple of Fortune,respecting which we have already cited an ancientinscription when discussing the site of the templesof Concord and Jupiter Tonans. It is perhaps thetemple of Fortuna Primigenia mentioned by Plutarch(Fori. Rom. 10) as having been bnilt by Servius onthe Capitoline, and alluded to apparently by Clemens.(ProtrtpL iv. St. p. 15. Sylb.) The temple ofHonos and Virtus, built by C. Marine, certainlycould not have been on the northern eminence, sincewc learn from Festus (p. 34, Mull.) that he wascompelled to build it low lest it should interfere withthe prospect of the augurs, and he should thus beordered to demolish it. Indeed Properties (iv. 11.45) mentions it as being on the Tarpeian rock, orsouthern summit: — "Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere saxoJura dare et statuas inter ct arma Man." Whence we discover another indication that theaugnraculum could not possibly have been on theNE. height; for in that case, with the huge templeof Jupiter befure it, there would have been littlecause to quarrel with this bagatelle erected by Ma-rius. It must hare stood on a lower point of the 3 D

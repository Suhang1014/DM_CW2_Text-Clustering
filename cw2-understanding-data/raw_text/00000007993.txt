Hut to saythat tin; name of Arrive* was derived from otherArrives can hardly be what tlie aulltor intended.Besides, the sense is disjointed; tor the relative guU(wrongly translated "of these parts of the city")cannot I>e made to refer to an antecedent that isseparated from it by a long sentence. As the textstands, quia must necessarily refer to Argeos in thesentence immediately preceding. It might be thoughtthat tins sentence has been interpolated, since Varrocalled an Arrive Argus, not Argivus. "Itaque dict-mus' hie Argus' cum hominemdicimus;cumoppidum,Graecanice 'hoc Argos,' cum Latine, 'Argei.' (/>.£.ix. §89, Mull.) We see from this passage that the moreancient Latin name for the town of Argos was A rgei(masc. plur.), and hence it might be inferred to beLivy's meaning that the chapels were called Argosor Argoses, not Argivs. Hut Argri, in still moreancient Latin than that of Varro, was also the namefor Argives as we find from a verse which he quotesfrom Ennius (vii. § 44); — '; Libaque, fictores, Argeos ct tutulatos ;M whence we are disposed to think that the name ofArgives, however anomalous the usage may appear,was really applied to the>e chapels, just as a modernItalian calls a church S. Pktro or S. Paolo, andthat the meaning of Varro in the second sentence ofthe passage quoted, is: "It is thought that theseArgoi (i. e. the sacraria so called) were namedafter the chiefs who came to Rome with the ArgiveHercules;" in which manner Varro would coincidewith Livy in making these Arge'i places. How else,too, shall we explain Ovid {Fast. iii. 791) : — "Itur ad Argeos, qui slnt sua pagina dicet?" And in like maimer Masurius Sabinus, quoted byGellius (iV. A. x. 15): "Atque etiam cum (Fla-minica) it ail Argeos." A passage in Paul us Dia-conus throws a gleam of light upon the matter;though, with more grammatical nicety than know­ledge of antiquity, lie has adopted, apparently fromthe Greek, a neuter form unknown to any otherwriter: "Argea loca appellantur Komae, quod inIds scpulti assent quidnin Argivorum illustres viri."'(p. 19, Miill.) Hence it appears that these chapelswere the (reputed) burial places of these Arriveheroes, and their masculine appellation thus gainsstill further probability. "K quts," &c. would mean,therefore, that the different Jservian Regions weremarked oil'and named according to these chapels. We have already remarked that though Varromentions 27 of the^c chapels, he enumerates only24. Hence Becker {IJandb. p. 386), as well asRunsen, are of opinion that the three odd oneswere upon the Capitol. The only reason assignedfor this conjecture is that the hill had threenatural divisions two heights with a depressionbetween them. Hut if we have rightly explainedVarro's meaning, it is impossible that the Capitolshould have had any of these ehaj>els. Blinsen,however, goes still further, and, connecting thechapels with the Argive men of straw which were jannually precipitated into the Tilter, thinks that;their numher might have been 30. allotting the remaining three to the ancient Cat/ito! on tbf Qt-rinal, although Varro had already aceoant*l fw t*usual nnml>er of six in that district, (brvbr. i149.)

We hare no account of its foundation~ tal the name would raise a presumptionE wut (sanded, or at least settled and enlarged,he constructed the Aemi- lian Way ; and this is confirmed by a passage ofFeat us, from which it appears that it was originallycalled Forum Lepidi. (Feat. J.r. Rhegium, p. 270.)The origin of the appellation of Regium, which com­pletely superseded the former name, is unknown. Itdid not become a colony like the neighbouring citiesof Mutina and Parma, and evidently never rose tothe same degree of opulence and prosperity as thosecities, but became, nevertheless, a flourishing muni­cipal town. It is repeatedly mentioned during thecivil war with M. Antonius, both before And afterthe battle of Mutina (Cic. ad Fam. xi. 9, xii. 5);and at a somewhat earlier period it was there thatM. Brutus, the father of the murderer of Caesar, wasput to death by Pompey in B.C. 79. (Oros. v. 22;Plut. Pomp. 16.) Its name scarcely occurs in his­tory during the Roman Empire; but its municipalconsideration is attested by inscriptions, and it ismentioned by all the geographers among the townson the Via Aemilia, though ranked by Strabo withthose of the second class. (Strab. v. p. 216; Plin.iii. 15. s. 20; Ptol. iii. 1. § 46; Orell. Imcr. 3983,4133; Tac. Hist. ii. 50; Phlegon. Macrob. 1.)Ptolemy alone gives it the title of a Colonia, which isprobably a mistake ; it was certainly not such inthe time of Pliny, nor is it so designated in anyextant inscription. Zumpt, however, supposes thatit may have received a colony under Trajan orHadrian. (Zumpt, de Colon, p. 403.) St. Ambrosenotices Regium as well as Placentia and Mutinaamong the cities which bad fallen into great decaybefore the close of the fourth century. (Ambros.Ep. 39.) It was not long before this that an attempthad l>een made by the emperor Gratian to repair tliedesolation of this part of Italy by settling a body ofGothic captives in the territory of Regium, Parma,and the neighbouring cities. (Ammian. xxxi. 9.§ 4.) The continued existence of Regium at a lateperiod is proved by the Itineraries and Tabula (/tin.Ant. pp.283, 287; Itin. Hier. p. 616; Tab. Prut.),and it is mentioned lung after the fall of the WesternEmpire by Paulus Diaconus among the " locupletesurbes" of Aemilia. (P. Diac. Hist, lsong. ii. 18.)In the middle ages it rose to a great degree of pro-speriiy, and Reggio is still a considerable town withabout 16000 inhabitants. Its episcopal see datesfrom the fifth century. The tract called the Campi Macri, celebrated forthe excellence of its wool, was apparently included inthe territory of Regium Lepidum. [E. H.

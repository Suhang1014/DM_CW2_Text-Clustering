[v. 11. s. 18;Mela, it. 2. § 5), a coast-town or district of Thrace,on the Euxine, about 60 miles N\V. from theentrance of the Bosporus, probably somewhere inthe neighbourhood of the modem ASidjeh. Theeastern offshoots of the Haemus here come very closeto the shore, which they divide from the valley ofthe Hebrus, The people of Sahnydes&us were thuscut oft' from communication with the less barbarousportions of Thrace, and became notorious for theirNivage and inhuman character, which harmonisedwell with that of their country, the coast of whichw.is extremely dangerous. Aeschylus {From. 726)*describes Salmydessus as " the nipped jaw of thesea, hostile to sailors, step-mother of ships;" andXenophon {A nab. vii. 5. § 12, seq.) informs us,that in his time its people carried on the businessof wreckers in a very systematic manner, the coastheitig marked out into portions by means of postserected along it, and those to whom each portionwas assigned having the exclusive right to plunderall vessels and persons cast upon it. This plan, hesays, was adopted to prevent the bloodshed whichhad frequently been occasioned among themselves bytheir previous practice of indiscriminate plunder.Strabo (vii. p. .'119) describes this portion of tliecoast of the Euxine as "desert, rocky, destitute ofharbours, and completely exposed to the nortliwinds;" while Xenophou (Z. c.) characterises the staadjoining it as " full of shoals." The earlier writersappear to speak of Salmydessus as a district only,but in later authors, as Apoliodurus, Pliny, andMela, it is mentioned as a town. Little is known respecting the history of thisplace. Herodotus (iv. 93) states that its inhabi­tants, with some neighbouring Thracian tribes, sub­mitted without resistance to Darius when he wasmarching through their country towards the Danube.When the remnant of the Greeks who had followedCyrus the Younger entered the service of Seuthes,one of the expeditions in which they were employedunder Xenophon was to reduce the people ol Salmy­dessus to obedience; a task which thev seem to * In this passage the poet, strangely enough,places Salmydessus in Asia Minor, near the Ther-modon. Virgil makes a mistake the converse ofthis iu calling the Thermodon a Thracian river;— "Threiciac flumina Thermodontis," (Aen. xi. 659); unless, indeed, as is possible, the epithet is intendedto indicate merely the supposed original abode of theAmazons iu 'J brace. have accomplished without moch difictiltv. {A*k L c.)

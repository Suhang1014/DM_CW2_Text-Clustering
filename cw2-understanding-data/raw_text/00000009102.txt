Pallantium took partnaaadatiao of Megalopolis, B.C. 371 (Paus.*j *); but it continued to exist an an inde- pendent state, since we find the Pallantieis mcntioneilalong with the Tegeatae, Megalopolitae and A.-eatae,as joining Epaminondas before the battle of Man-tineia, B. c. 362. (Xen. Hell TO. 5. §5.) Pal-lantium subsequently sank into a mere village, butwas restored and enlarged by the emperor AntoninusPius, who conferred upon it freedom from luxationand other privileges, on account of its reputed con­nection with Rome. The town was visited by Pau-sanias, who found here a shrine containing statues ofPallas and Evander, a temple of Core (Proserpine),a statue of Polybius; and on the hill above the town,which was anciently used as an acropolis, a temple ofthe pure (frolapot) gods. (Paus. viii.43. § 1, 44. §§5,6.) Leake was unable to find the site of Pallantium,and supposed that it occupied a part of Trijnilitzaitself; though at a later time he appears to haveadopted the erroneous opinion of Gell, who placed itat the village of Thana, to the S. of Tnjwlilza.(Leake, Morea, vol. i. pp. 117, 118, vol. iii. p. 36;Gell, Itinerary of the Morea, p. 136.) The remainsof the town were first discovered by the French ex­pedition at a quarter of an hour's distance from theKhan of Makri on the road from Tripolitza toJ^eondaru The ruins have been used so long as aquarry by the inhabitants of Tripolitza and of theneighbouring villages, that there are very few tracesof the ancient town. Ross discovered the foundationsof the temple of the pure gods on the highest pointof the acropolis.

PALLA'NUM, a town of the Frentani, the nameof which is known only from the Tabula, whichplaces it on the road from Anxanum (Lanviano)to Histonium; but the distances are corrupt andconfused. According to Romanelli, extensive ruinsstill remain of an ancient city on a site still calledMonte Pallano, about 3 miles S\V. of ,1/e a. Itis difficult, however, to reconcile this position withthe course of the route given in the Tabula. (Tab.Pevt.; Romanelli, vol. Iii. p. 43; Zannoni, Carta delRegno di Xapoli, UL 4.) [E. H.

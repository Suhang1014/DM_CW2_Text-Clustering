It was situated in a fertileplain, and its site is identified with that of someextensive rains S. of Sophia. [J. 11.] TR1BALU (TptSoAAuf), a Thracian people whichappears to have been in early times a very widelydiffused and powerful race, about the Danube; butwhich, being pressed upon from the N. and W. byvarious nations, became gradually more and moreconfined, and at length entirely disappeared fromhistory. Herodotus speaks of the Triballic plain,through which flowed the river Angnis, which fellinto the lirongus, a tributary of the Ister (iv. 49).This is probably the plain of Kusaovo in the modernServia. Thucydides states (ii. 96) that on the side of theTribalH, who were independent at the beginning ofthe Peloponnesian War, the territories of Sitalceawere bounded by the 'Ireres and Tilataei, whose W.limit was the river Oscius (Ocscus), which musttherefore, at that time, have been the E. frontier ofthe Triballi. (Cf. Plin. iii. 29, iv. 17; Strab. vii.pp. 317, .'(IS.) Strabo(vii. p. 305) informs us thatt'ne Triballi were much exposed to the inroads ofmigrating hordes driven out of their own countriesby more powerful neighbours, some expelled by theScythians, Bastarnae, and Sauromatae, from the N.side of the Danube, who either settled in the islandsof that river, or crossed over into Thrace; othersfrom the W., set in motion by the Ulyrians. The earliest event recorded of them is the defeatwhich they gave to Sitalccs, king of the Odryaae,who made an expedition against them, B.C. 424, inwhich he lost his life (Thuciv. 101). In B.C.376the Triballi crossed the Llaemus, and with 30.000men advanced as far S. as the territory of Abdera,which they ravaged without opposition. On theirreturn, however, loaded with booty, the people ofAbdera took advantage of their careless and dis­orderly march, to attack them, killing upwards of2000 men. The Triballi thereupon inarched backto take revenge for this loss; and the Abderites,having been joined by some of the neighbouringThracians, gave them battle; in the midst of whichthey were deserted by their treacherous allies and,being surrounded, were slain almost to a man. TheTriballi then prepared to lay siege to Abdera whichwould now have been quite unable to resist them formore than a very short time; but at this criticalmoment, Chabrias appeared before the town with theAthenian fleet, which had recently defeated theLacedaemonian fleet at Naxos. Chabrias compelledthe Tnballi to retire from Abdera, and garrisonedthe city when he departed. (Diod. xv. 36). In B.C.339, Philip II., after raising the siege of Byzantium,inarched to the Danube, where he defeated the Gclae,and took much booty. On his return through thecountry of the Triballi, the latter posted themselvesin a defile, and refused to allow the Macedonian armyto pass, unless Philip gave to them a part of theplunder. A fierce battle ensued, in which Philip was severely wounded, and wouM la*« ben yrbut for his son Alexander, who thr?* U'.r«ybis father, and thus saved his lite.

I have attempted to enumerate those high-prieststhat we have had during the interval of two thousand years : Ihave also carried down the succession of our kings, and relatedtheir actions, and political administration, without [considerable]errors, as also the power of our monarchs ; and all according towhat is written in our sacred books ; for this it was that I pro­mised to do in the beginning of this history.

And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing-, if I treatbriefly of my own family, and of the actions of my own life,while there is still living such as can either prove what 1 say tobe false, or can attest that it is true ; with which accounts I shallput an end to these Antiquities, which are contained in twentybooks and sixty thousand verses. And if God * permit me, I will

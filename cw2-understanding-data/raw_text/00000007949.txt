Old Pleuron ( v waAoia TWtvpav, Strab. x-p. 451), was situated in the plain between the Ache-lous and the Evenus, W. of Calydon, at the foot ofMount Curium, from which the Curetes are said tohave derived their name. Pleuron and Calydonwere the two chief towns of Actolia in the heroicage, and are said by Strabo ( x. p. 450) to have beenthe ancient ornament (tooVxwO of Greece. Pleuronwas originally a town of the Curetes, and its inhabit­ants were engaged in frequent wars with the Aeto-lians of the neighbouring town of Calydon. TheCuretes, whose attack upon Calydon is mentioned inan episode of the Iliad (ix. 529), appear to havebeen the inhabitants of Pleuron. At the time ofthe Trojan War, however, Pleuron was an Aetoliancity, and its inhabitants sailed against Troy underthe command of the Aetolian chief Thoas, the son(not the grandson) of Oeneus. (Horn. II. ii. 639,comp. xiii. 217, xiv. 116.) Ephorus related thatthe Curetes were expelled from I'leuronia, whichwas formerly called Curetis, by Aeolians (ap. Strab.x. p. 465); and this tradition may also be traced inthe statement of Thucydides (iii. 102) that thedistrict, called Calydon and Pleuron in the time ofthe Peloponnesian War, formerly bore the name ofAeolis. Since Pleuron appears as an Aetolian cityin the later period of the heroic age, it is representedin some traditions as such from the beginning.Hence it is said to have derived its name fromPleuron, a son of Aetolus; and at the very timethat some legends represent it as the capital of theCuretes, and engaged in war with Oeneus, king ofCalydon, others suppose it to have been governed bythe Aetolian Thestius, the brother of Oeneus. Thes-tius was also represented as a descendant of Pleuron;and hence Pleuron had an heroum or a chapel atSparta, as being the ancestor of Leda, the daughterof Thestius. But there are all kinds of variationsin these traditions. Thus we find in SophoclesOeneus, and not Thestius, represented as king ofPleuron. (Apollod. i. 7. § 7; Pans. iii. 14. § 8;Soph. Track. 7.) Ope of the tragedies of Phry-nichus, the subject of which appears to have been thedeath of Meleagcr, the son of Oeneus, was entitlednAcvpcwiaf, or the "Pleuronian Women;" andhence it is not improbable that Phrynichus, as wellas Sophocles, represented Oeneus as king of Pleuron.(Pans. x. 31. § 4.) Pleuron is rarely mentionedin the historical jieriod. It was abandoned by itsinhabitants, says Stralto, in consequence of the ra­vages of Demetrius, the Aetolian, a surname proba­bly given to Demetrius II., king of Macedonia (whoreigned B.C. 239—229), to distinguish him fromDemetrius Poliorcctes. (Strab. x. p. 451.) The in­habitants now built the town of 2. New PijifRox (^ vttrripa IlA«i/pc£i'), whichwas situated at the foot of Mt. Aracynthus. Shortlybefore the destruction of Corinth (n. c 146), wofind Pleuron, which was then a member of theAchaean League, petitioning the Romans to be dis­severed from it. (Paus. vii. 11. § 3.) I.eake sup­poses, on satisfactory grounds, the site of New Pleu­ron to be represented by the ruins called to Kdcrrpov■njj Kvpias Eip^njs, or the Couth of Laity Irrncabout one hour's ride from Mtxolamjhi. These ruinsoccupy the broad summit of one of the steep andrngL'ed heights of Mt. /.ygot (the ancient Aracyn­thus), which bound tlte plain of Mttolonghi to thenorth. Leake says that the walls were about a milein circumference, but Mure and Dudwell describe thecircuit as nearly two miles. The most remarkable T T

H.D.J TIMA'VUS (Tlpavos: Timao), a river of Venetia,flowing into the Adriatic sea between Aquileia andTergeste, about 12 miles E. of the fonner city.Notwithstanding its classical celebrity, it is one ofthe shortest of rivers, being formed by copioussources which burst out from the rock at the foot ofa lofty clitF, and immediately constitute a broad anddeep river, which has a course of littlo more than amile before it discharges itself into the sea. Therecan be no doubt that these sources are the outlets ofsome subterranean stream, and that the account ofl'osidonius (op. Strab. v. p. 215), who says that theriver after a course of some length falls iuto achasm, and is carried under ground about 130stadia before it issues out again and falls into thesea, is substantially correct. Such subterraneanpassages arc indeed not uncommon in Camiola, andit is impossible to determine from what particularriver or lake the waters of the Timavus derive theirorigin; but the popular notion still regards them asthe outflow of a stream which sinks into the earthnear S. Canz'mn, about 13 miles from the place oftheir reappearance. (Cluver. ItaL p. 193.) Thenumber of the sources is variously stated: Virgil,in the well-known passage in which he describesthem (Aen. i. 245), reckons them nine in number,and this agrees with the statement of Mela; whileStrabo speaks of seven; anil this would appear fromServius to have been the common belief (Serf,ad Am,I. c.; Mel. ii. 4. § 3), which is supported also by Mar­tial, while Claudian follows Virgil (Mart. iv. 25. G;Claudian, de VI. Cons. Hon. 198). Cluverius, onthe other hand, could find but six, and some moderntravellers make them only four. Strabo adds that,according to Poly M us, all but one of them were salt,a circumstance which would imply some connectionwith the sea, and, according to Cluverius, whodescribed them from personal observation, this wasdistinctly the case in his time; for though at low-water the stream issued tranquilly from its rockysources, and flowed with a still and placid currentto the sea, yet at high tides the waters were swollen,so as to rush forth with much greater force andvolume, and inundate the neighbouring meadows:and at such times, he adds, the waters of all thesources but one become perceptibly brackish, doubt­less from some subterranean communication withthe sea. (Cluver. ItaL p. 194.) It appears fromthis account that Virgil's remarkable expressions— "Unde per ora novem, vasto cum murmure inontisIt mart proruptum, ct pelago premit arva sonauti" —are not mere rhetorical exaggerations, but have afoundation in fact. It was doubtless from a refer­ence to the same circumstance that, according to Polybius (ap. Strab. L c), the tfmsby the natives " the source and motfjtr rf It t*'(jUfTfpa ttjs &aXdTTT?T.)

By the grateful zeal of the Christians,the deliverer of the church has been decorated withevery attribute of a hero, and even of a saint; whilethe discontent of the vanquished party has com­pared Constantine to the most abhorred of thosetyrants, who, by their vice and weakness, disho­noured the Imperial purple. The same passions havein some degree been perpetuated to succeeding ge­nerations, and the character of Constantine is con­sidered, even in the present age, as an object eitherof satire or of panegyric. By the impartial union ofthose defects which are confessed by his warmest ad­mirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledgedby his most implacable enemies, we might hope todelineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man,which the truth and candour of history should adoptwithout a blush. But it would soon appear, thatthe vain attempt to blend such discordant colours,and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities, mustproduce a figure monstrous rather than human, un­less it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights, bya careful separation of the different periods of thereign of Constantine.

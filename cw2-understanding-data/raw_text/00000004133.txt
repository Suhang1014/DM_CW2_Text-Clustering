V. for they were equally destroyed in both cases; for every suchperson was put to death under this pretence, that they werogoing to desert, hut in reality that the robbers might get,what they had. The madness of the seditious did also in­crease together with their famine, and both those miserieswere every day inflamed more and more; for there was nocorn which any where appeared publicly, but the robberscame running into, and searched men's private houses ; andthen if they found any, they tormented them, because theyhad denied they had any, and if they found none, they tor­mented them worse, because they supposed they had morecarefully concealed it.

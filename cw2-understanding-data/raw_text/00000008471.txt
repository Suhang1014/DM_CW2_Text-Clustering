The lowertown is on the other side of the river opposite to thepeninsula, with which it is connected by a stonebridge, the foundations of which are Roman. There is a Roman triumphal arch witha single pas­sage. The date of its construction does not appear.This arch which was nearly hidden by rubbish andbuildings has been partially uncovered and restoredwithin the present century. It is decorated withsculptures. There are some remains of the aque-<lnet which supplied Yesontio with water from adistant source. It was constructed of a soft stone. Itterminated in the town in a vast reservoir of an ovalform, which was covered by a roof supported bycolumns. The water was distributed from the re­servoir all through the town: and in many parts ofBesanqon there have been found traces of the con­duits which conveyed the water to the privatehouses.

It is identi­fied with the present Borneo, (Cf. Mentelic, Etp.Mod.?. 37.) [T.H. D.] VESTINI (Ot'ijCTTiVoi), a people of Central Italy,who occupied a mountainous tract extending fromthe coast of the Adriatic to the lofty mountains nearthe sources of the Aternus. Here they met theNubincs, whose territory bounded them on the W.;thence they were bounded by the high moun­tain range which forms the southern barrier of thevalley of the Aternus, and separated them from theAeqni and Marsi; while towards the S. and E. theriver Aternus itself, from the point where it takesthe sudden bend towards the NE., became the limitof their territory, and their frontier towards the Pe-ligni and Marrucini. Along the coast of the Adriaticthey held only the narrow space between the mouthof the Aternus and that of the Matrinus, a distance ofabout G miles; the latter river apparently formedthe northern limit of their territory from its mouthto its source, and thence to the high ridge of theCentral Ai>onuines their exact frontier cannot betraced. But it is almost immediately after passingthe point where the Vestiui adjoined the Praetutnon the one hand and the Sabines on the other, thatthe chain of the Apennines rises abruptly into thelofty group or m:iss, of which the Monte Corno(commonly called the Gran Sasso d Italia) Is thehighest summit. This mountain is the most ele­vated in tlie whole range of the Apennines, attainingto a height of 9500 feet; and those immediately ad­joining it are but little inferior, forming a rugged andirregular mass of mountains, which is continuedwithout interruption by a range of inferior but stillvery considerable elevation, in a SE. direction. Thisrange is almost continuous with the equally loftyridge of the Monte Aforrone, the two being separatedonly by the deep and narrow gorge below Popolt,through which the Aternus finds its way to the sea.Hence the territory of the Vestini is naturally dividedinto two distinct regions, the one consisting of theupper valley of the Aternus, W. of the lofty mountainrange above described, the other of the tract on the E.of the same mountains, sloping gradually thenceto the sea. This last district U very hilly andragged, but has the advantage ofa far milder climatethan that of the basin of the Aternus, which is a ,bleak and cold upland region, having much analogy | with the valley of the Peligui (of vtinVtw »considered in some decree as a osxa^s *from its considerable elevation above Ik mfeet in its upper part) suffering Kill nan mtcfrom cold in winter.

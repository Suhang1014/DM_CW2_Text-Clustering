We shall therefore content ourselveswith observing, and indeed with repeating, some of the most im­portant circumstances of climate, of manners, and of institutions,which rendered the wild barbarians of Germanyj such formidableenemies to the Roman power. Extent of Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the pro­vince westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the Roman yoke,extended itself over a third part of Europe. Almost the whole of mo­dern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Livonia, Prussia,and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by the various tribes ofone great nation, whose complexion, manners, and language, denoteda common origin, and preserved a striking resemblance. On thewest, ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallic,and on the south, by the Danube, from the lllyrian provinces ofthe empire. A ridge of hills, rising from the Danube, and calledthe Carpathian Mountains, covered Germany on the side of Daciaor Hungary.

In the remote darkness of the north, the ancients im­perfectly descried a frozen ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea,and beyond the Peninsula, or islands 1 of Scandinavia. Climate. Some ingenious writers 1 have suspected that Europe was much colder formerly than it is at present; and the most ancient descrip­tions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to confirm theirtheory. The general complaints of intense frost, and eternal winter,are perhaps little to be regarded, since we have no method of re­ducing to the accurate standard of the thermometer, the feelings, orthe expressions, of an orator, born in the happier regions of Greeceor Asia. But I shall select two strong and incontestible proofs of aless equivocal nature. I. The great rivers which covered the ■ Roman.

OCR Output THE ANNALS Arulenus Rusticus (a) assisted at thisconsultation. He was, at that time, a tri足bune of the people; a young man of sen足timent, eager to be in action, and warmwith the love of glory. He offered to in足terpose, by his tribunitian authority, toprevent a decree of the senate. " For-" bear," said Thrasea, " and learn, young" man, to restrain this impetuous ar-" dour. By a rash opposition you cannot" save your friend, and you may bring" down ruin on yourself. For me, I have" lived my days; my course is well nigh" finished; it now remains, that I reach" the goal with undiminished honour. As" to you, my friend, you have but lately" entered the career of civil dignities. Life" is before you, and you have not as yet" pledged yourself to the public. Ere you" take a decided part, it will behove you" to consider well the times upon which" you are fallen, and the principles which4* you mean to avow." Having thus de足clared his sentiments, he gave no opinionconcerning the propriety of appearing inthe senate, but reserved the question forhis own private meditation.

Npw as these men were corrupted by them with money,they sold the Cutheans their interest for rendering this buildinga slow and a careless work, for Cyrus, who was busy aboutother wars, knew nothing of all this; and it so happened, thatwhen he had led his army against the * Massagetae he ended hislife. But when Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, had taken thekingdom, the governor in Syria, and Pnenicia, and in thecountries of Ammon, and Moab, and Samaria, wrote an epis­tle to Cambyses; whose contents were as follows: " To OUF Lord"Cambyses; we thy servants, Rathunms the historiographer,H and Semellius the scribe, and the rest that are thy judges in"Syria and Phenicia, sendeth greeting: If is fit, O King,"that thou shouldest know that these Jews which were car-"ried to Babylon, are come into our country, and are build-"ing that rebellious and wicked city, and its market places,"and setting up its walls, and raising up the temple: know"therefore, that when these things are finished, they will not*' be willing to pay tribute, nor will they submit to thy com-"mands, but will resist kings, and will choose rather to rule overM others, than be ruled over themselves.

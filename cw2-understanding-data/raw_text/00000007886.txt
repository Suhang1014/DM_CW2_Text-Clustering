OCR Output PAPHUS. T A PRE MIS. denote both Old anil New Paphos, but with this dis­tinction, that in prose writers it commonly meansNew Paphos, whilst in the poets, on the contrary,—for whom the name of Palaepaphos would have beenunwieldy,— it generally signifies Old PapJtas, themore peculiar beat nt" the worship of Aphrodite. Ininscriptions, also, both towns are culled Hdtpos.Tliis iniliscriminato u>,e is sometimes productive ofambiguity, especially in the Latin prose authors. Old Paphos, now Kukki or Konuklia (Engel,Kyprvs, vol. i. p. 125), was said to have beenfounded by Cinyras, the father of Adonis (Apollod.iii. 14); though according to another legend [ire-served by Stnibo(xi. p. 505),—whose text, however,varies, — it was founded by the Amazon?. It wasseated on an eminence ("celsa Paphos,"' Virg. A e». x.51), at the distance of about. 10 stadia, or 1 J mile,from the sea, on which, however, it bad a roadstead,it was not far distant from the promontory of Ze-phyrium (Strab. xiv. p. 683) and the mouth of thelittle river Bocarus. (Hesych. *. v. Bwnapos.) Thefable ran that Venus bad landed there when she rosefrom out the sea. (Tar. Hist. ii. 3; Mela, ii. 7;Eucan, viii. 456.) According to Pausanias (i. 14),her worship was introduced at Paphos from Assyria;but it is much more probable that it was of Phoe-nieian origin. [Phoenh'ta.] It had been veryanciently established, and before the time of Homer,as the prove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos arcmentioned in the Odyssey (viii. 362). Mere theworship "t the goddess centred, not fur Cyprus alone,but for the whole earth. The Cinyradue. or de­scendants of Cinyras,—Greek by name, but of Phoe­nician origin,—were the chief prier-ts. Their powerand authority were very great; but it may be inferredfrom certain inscriptions that they were controlledby a senate and an assembly of the people. There wasalso an oracle here. (Kngel.i. p. 483.) l ew cities haveever been so much sung anil glorified by the p-iets.(Cf. Aeseh. Sitppl. 525; Virg. Aen. i. 415; Hor.Vd. i. 19. 30, iii. 25; Stat.&'/c. i.2. 101; Aristoph.Lysis. 833, &r. &c.) The remains of the vast tem­ple of Aphrodite are still discernible, its circumfe­rence being marked by huge inundation walls. Afteriu overthrow by an earthquake, it was rebuilt byVespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as wellas on earlier and later ones, and especially in themost perfect style on those of Septimius Severus.(Engel, vol. i. p. 130.) From these representations,and from the existing remains, HeUch, an architect!of Coj**nhagen, has attempted to restore the building.(Miillor's Arcfuiol. § 239, p. 201; Eckhel, vol. iii.p. 86.) New Paphos, now Bnffa, was seated on the sea.near the western extremity of the island, and pos­seted a go id barb' ur. It lay about 00 stadia, orbetween 7 and 8 miles NW. of the ancient city.(S:rab. xiv. p. 683.) It was said to have beenfounded by Agaj>enor, chief of the Arcadians at thesiege of Troy (Horn. //. ii. 609), who, after thethe capture of that town, was driven by the storm,which separated the Grecian fleet, on the coast ofCyprus. (I'aus. viii. 5. § 3.) We find Agapenormeutioned as king of the Paphians in a Greek dis­tich preserved in the Atialvcta (i. p. 181, Ltrunk);anil Herodotus {vii. 90) alludes an Arcadiancolony in Cyprus. Like its ancient namesake, NeaPaphos was also distinguished for the worship ofVenus, and contained several magnificent templesdedicated to that gtidd<->s.

OCR Output OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 351 the senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the chap.first time, a share in the public deliberations; and'the same generals, Victor and Arintheus, who hadsuccessfully directed' the conduct of the war, were em­powered to regulate the conditions of peace. Thefreedom of trade, which the Goths had hitherto en­joyed, was restricted to two cities on the Danube;the rashness of their leaders was severely punished bythe suppression of their pensions and subsidies; andthe exception, which was stipulated in favour ofAthanaric alone, was more advantageous than honour­able to the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who,on this occasion, appears to have consulted his privateinterest, without expecting the orders of his sovereign,supported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, inthe personal interview which was proposed by theministers of Valens. He-persisted in his declaration,that it was impossible for him, without incurring theguilt of perjury, ever to set his foot on the territoryof the empire; and it is more than probable, thathis regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmedby the recent arid fatal examples of Roman treachery.The Danube, which separated the dominions of thetwo independent nations, was chosen for the scene ofthe conference. The emperor of the East, and the Judgeof the Visigoths, accompanied by an equal number ofarmed followers, advanced in their respective bargesto the middle of the stream. After the ratificationof the treaty, and the delivery of hostages, Valensreturned in triumph to Constantinople; and theGoths remained in a state of tranquillity about sixyears;, till they were violently impelled against theRoman empire, by an innumerable host of Scythians,who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of theNorth *. * The Gothic war is described by Ammianus (xxvii. 5.), Zosimus (1 . iv. p.21 \—2\4.), and Themistius (Orat. x. p. 129—141.).

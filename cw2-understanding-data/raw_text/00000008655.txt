It is well known that it was early identifiedby the Greeks with the mythical Eridahus, andwas commonly called by them, as well as by theLatin poets, by that name, even at a late period.The origin and history of this name have been alreadygiven in the article Eridakus. It may be added,that the poplar trees which figure in the fable ofPhaeton (in its later form) evidently refer to the talland graceful trees, still commonly known as Loni-bardy poplars, from their growing in abundance onthe banks of the Po.

It is said to have derivedits name from a small stream in the neighbourhood.(Const. Porphyr. Vit. Basil. 36 j comp. Cedren. p.575; Jo. Scylitz. Hut. pp. 829, 844.) The placeis still called /Wend. [L.

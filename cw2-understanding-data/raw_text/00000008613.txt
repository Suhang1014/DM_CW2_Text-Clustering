We hare no state­ment in any ancient writer as to the ethnic origin oraffinities of the VoKcians. and are left almost whollyto conjecture on the subject. But tlie remains of thelan^uaire, few ami scanty as they are. afford neverthe­less tlie safest foundation onwhieh to rest ourtheories;anil these lead vis to regard the Yolseintis as a branchoft lie same family with the Umhrians and 0>eans, whoformed the aboriginal population of the mountaintracts of Central Italy. It would appear, indeed, asif they were more closely connected with the Um-hrians than either the Sabines and their Sabellianoffshoots, or the Oscans properly so called ; it isprobable, therefore, that the Volscians had separatedat a still earlier period from the main stock of theUmbrian race. (Mommson, Unier-ltal. L>i<thkt. pp.319—326 ; Sehweirler, fifon. Gesch. vol. i. p. 178.)The only notice of their language that occurs inRoman authors, also points to it distinctly as differentfrom Oscan (Titinius, op. FesL v. (Jbscum, p. 189).though the difference was undoubtedly that of twocognate dialects, not of two radically distinct lan­guages- When the Volscians first appear in Roman history,it is as a powerful and warlike nation, who werealready established in the possession of the greaterpart at least of the territory which they subsequentlyoccupied. Their exact limits are not, indeed, to hedetermined with accuracy; and it is probable thatthey underwent considerable fluctuations during theirlong wars with the Latins and Romans. But thereseems no doubt that from a very early period theyheld the whole of the detached mountain groupS. of the Tolerus (Sacco), termed by modern geo­grapher the Monti Lepiui, together with the valleyof the Liris, and the mountain district of Arpinum,Sora, and Atina. Besides this they were certainlrmasters at one time of the plains extending from theVolscian Apennines to the sea, including the Pomp-tine Marshes and the fertile tract that borders onthem. This tract they had, according to Cato, wrestedfrom the Aborigines, who were its earliest possessors(Cato ap. Priscian. v. p. G68). The first mention of the Volsehns in Roman his­tory is in the reign of the second Tarquin, when theyappear as a numerous and warlike people. It isclear that it was the great extension of the Romanpower under its last king (which must undoubtedlybe admitted as a historical fact), and the supremacywhich he had assumed over the Latin League, thatfirst brought him into collision with the Volscians.According to the received history he marched intotheir country and took their capital city, Suessa Po-inetia, by assault (Liv. i. 53; Dionys. iv. 50;Cic. de litp. ii. 24.) The tradition that it was thespoils there obtained which enabled him to buildthe Capitol at Koine, sufficiently proves the beliefiu the great power and wealth of the Volscianslit this early period ; and the foundation of thetwo colonies of Cireeii and Sigma, both of which areexpressly ascribed to Tarquin, was doubtless intendedto secure bis recent conquests, and to impose a perma­nent check on the extension of the Volscian power.It, is evident, moreover, from the first treaty witliCartilage, preserved to us by Polybius (iii. 22), thatthe important cities of Antium and Tarracina, aswell as Cireeii, were at tins time sul-ject to Tarquin,and could not, therefore, have been iu the hands ofthe Vulisciaiis.

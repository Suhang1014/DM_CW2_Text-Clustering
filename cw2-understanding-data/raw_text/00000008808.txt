The first of these colonies was Be--*. where Augustus settled the veterans of the•i V. Maoedooica, and VIII. Augusta. It was acis juris Italic! (Kckhel, iii. p. 356; Orelli,r. no. 514; Ulpian, Dig. 50. tit. 15. s. 1. § 1; Ku- Carea. p. 155. Seal.) Augustus also foundedMpJrt (Ba/dbek), which received the jus Italicnma SrptMiuae Severus (Ulpian, L e.\ Kckhel, ill p. 334). Under Claudius wiui founded Ptolemais(Ace), wliich did not possess the jus Italicum (Ul­pian, ib. § 3; Plin. v. 1 ; Kckhel, iii. p. 424).Vespasian planted two colonies, Caesareia (TurrisStratonis) and Kicopolis (Krnmnus) Paul. Dig.50. tit. 15. a. 8. §7; Kckhel, iii. p. 430); whichlatter, however, though originally a military colony,appears to have possessed neither the right, nor thename of a colonia (Kckhel, iii. p. 454; Joseph.Bell. Jud. vii. 6; Soiwmen, Ilitt. Ecclct. v. 21.) Thechief colony founded by Hadrian was Aelia Capito-lina (Jerusalem), whose colonists, however, wereGreeks, and therefore it did not possess the jus Itali-cum. (Dion Cass. Ixix. 12; Kuseb. Ilitt. Ecclet. iv.6;Manilas, xi. p. 279, ed. Bonn; Ulpian, L c. § 6.)Hadrian also probably foumled Palmyra. UnderSeptiinius Severus we have Laodiceia, Tyrus, andSebaste (Samaria), of which the first two possessedthe jus ltalicum. (Ulpian, ii. §3. and 7; Kckhel,iii. p. 319, 387, soq., 440, acq.) Cararalla foundedAntioch and Kmesa (Ulpian, ib. § 4; Paul. ib. § 5;Kckhel, iii. 302, 311), Klagabnlus Sidon (Kckhel,iii. p. 371), and Philippus, apparently, Damascus(ib. p. 331). To these must be added two colonieswhose foundation is unknown, Capitolias, of whoseformer name we arc ignorant (Paul. Dig. 50. tit. 15.s. 8. § 7: Kckhel, iii. p. 328, seq.), and Caesareiaad Libanum (Area). (Kckhel, ib. p. 361.) At the end of the fourth century of our era, Syriawas divided into atill smaller portions, namely: 1.Syria prima, governed by a ronsularis, with themetropolis of Antioch and the following cities:Seleuceu, Laodiceia, Gabala, Paltos, Brruea, Chains. 2. Syria Secunda, nnder a praeaes, with Apameiamrits chief city, and the dependent towns of Kpiphaneia,Arethuaa, Larissa, Mariamne, Balaneia, Kaphaneae,and Seieuceia ad Belum. Malahts (xiv. p. 265, ed.Bonn.) ascribes ita separation from Syria Primato tlie reign of Theodosius II., which, however, maybe doubted. Bocking attributes the division toTheodosius tlie Great (ad A'ot Dignit. i. p. 129). 3. Phoenicia Prima, under a consularis, with themetropolis of Tyrus and the cities Ptolemais, Sidon,Berytus, Byblos, Botryo, Tripolis, Arcae, Orthosias,Aradus, Antaradus, Caesarea Paneas. 4. PhoeniciaSecunda, or Phoenicia ad Libanum, under a prse-es,having Damascus for its capital, and embracing: thecities of Kmesa, laodiceia ail Libanum, Heliopolis,Abila, Palmyra. It was 6r»t separated by Theo­dosius the Great. 5. Palnestina Prima, administeredby a consularis, and in the years 383—385 by a pro-eonsul. Its chief city was Caesareia, and it com­prehended the towns of Dora, Antipatris, Diospolis,Azotus ad Mare, Azotus Mediterranea, Kleuthero-polis, Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem). Nespolis, Livias,Sebaste, Antliedon, Diocletianopolis, Jup(M, Gsza,Ilaphia, Ascalon, &c 6. Palaestina Secunda, undera praeses, with the capital of Scythopolis, and thetowns of Gadara, Abila, Capitolias, Hippos, Tibe­rias, Dio Caesareia, and Gabae. 7. Palaestina Tei-tia. This was formed out of the former province ofArabia. (Pmcop. dc Aed. v. 8.) It was governedby a praeses, and its chief ciiy waa Petra. (Cf.Palaestina, Vol. II. p. 533.)

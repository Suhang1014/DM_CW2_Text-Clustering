Now as the Trojans jthroughout tlie Homeric poems appear as a peopleakin to the Greeks, and are even tailed Hellenesby Dionysius of Hnlicarnxssus (Ant. Rom. i. 61),it follows that the Phrygians also must have beenrelated to the Greeks. This, again, is further .sup­ported by direct evidence; tor, looking apart fromthe tradition about Pch>ps, which we have alreadyalluded to. king Midas is said to have been the first jof all foreigners to have dedicate*!, about the middleof the eighth century B. <:., a present to the Delphic!oracle (Herod, i. 14); and Plato {Crahji p. 410)mentions several words which were common to theGreek and Phrygian languages. (Comp. Jablonski,Opera, vol. iii. p. 64, ike. ed. Te Water.); and,lastly, the Armenian language itself is now provedto he akin to the Greek. (Schroeder, T/tesaur. Ling.Arm. p. 51.) The radical identity of the Phry­gians, Trojans, and Greeks being thus established,wo shall proceed to show that many other Asiaticnations belonged to the same stt>ck. The name ofthe Mygdoniaus, as already observed, is often usedsynonymously with that of the Phrygians (Paus. x.27. § 1), and in Homer (//. iii. 186) the leader ofthe Phrygians is called Mygdon. According to.Stephamis 13. (.«. v. Mvybavta), lastly, Mygdonia wast he name of a district in Great Pbrygia, as well asof a part of Macedonia. The boliones, who extendedwestward as far as the Aesepus, were separatedfrom the MygdonUns by the river flbyndacus.(Strab. xiv. p. 681; Sehol. ml Apollon. R/iod. i. 936,943, 1115.) At a later time they disappear fromhistory, their name being absorbed by that of thePhrygians. The Mysians are easily recognisable asa Phrygian people, both from their history and thecountry they inhabited. They, too, are called Th fa­cialis, and their language is said to have been amixture of Phrygian and Lydian (Strab. xii. p. 572),and Mysians and Phrygians were so intermingledthat their frontiers could scarcely be distinguished.(Strab. xii. p. 564; Eustath. ad Born. It. ii. 862,ad DUmys. Per. 810; Suid. *. v. ov<>ti> $}ttov.) Asto the M leonians, see LydiA. The tribes of AsiaMinor, which are usually designated by the namePelasgiaus, thus unquestionably were branches ofthe great Phrygian stock, and the whole of thewestern part of the peninsula was thus inhabited bya variety of tribes all belonging to the same family.Hut the Phrygians also extended into Europe, wheretheir chief seats were in the central [tirts of Emathia.(Herod, viii. 138; comp. Strab. xiv. p. 680.) Therewe meet with Phrygians, or with a modification oftheir name, Brygians, in all directions. Mardouius,on his expedition against Greece, met Brygnms inThrace. (Herod, vi. 45; Steph. B. s.v. Bpvnai;riin. iv. IS, where we have probably to read iirycaefor Brysae.) The Phrygian population of Thraceis strongly attested by the fact that many names ofplaces were common to Thrace and Troas. (Strab.xiii. p. 500; comp, Thucyd. ii. 99: Suid. v. &d-pupis; Solin. 15; Tzetz. Chil. iii. 812.) Traces ofPhrygians also occur in Chalcidice, (Lycoph. 1404;Steph. ii. 5. t\ Kpovais.) Further south they appearabout Mount Oeta and even in Attica. (Thucyd.ii. :i2; Strab. xiii. p. 621; Steph. P. 8. v. <i>pvyU and♦pficwe; Eustath. ad Diunyn. Per. 810.) MountOlympus, also, was perhaps only a repetition of thePhrygian name. In the vest of Edessa in Mace­donia, about lake Lychnidus, we meet with Bryges(Str.ib. vii. pp. 326,'327; Steph. P. s. v. B/»u£), andiu the same vicinity we have the towns of Brygion, Bryg'uis, and Mulatto BruciJa. (S-Vph. B. * wv.If. Hieros. p. 607.) The westernmost tr*es <Brygians we find about Pyrrlueliium. (Srrib.

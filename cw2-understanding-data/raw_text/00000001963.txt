A tasteless and unwholesome mixture,in which the bran thrice exceeded the quantity of flour,appeased the hunger of the poor; they were gradually'reduced to feed on dead horses, dogs, cats, and mice,and eagerly to snatch the grass, and even the nettles,which grew among the ruins of the city. A crowd ofspectres, pale and emaciated, their bodies oppressed withdisease, and their minds with despair, surrounded thepalace of the governor, urged, with unavailing truth,that it was the duty of a master to maintain his slaves,and humbly requested that he would provide for their-subsistence, permit their flight, or Gommand their imme­diate execution.

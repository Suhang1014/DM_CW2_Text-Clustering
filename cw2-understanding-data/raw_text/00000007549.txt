Now, at first she performed herworship to them privately, but when she was become Anileus'smarried wife, she worshipped them in her accustomed manner,'and with the same appointed ceremonies which she used in herformer husband's days ; upon which their most esteemed friendsblamed him at first, that he did not act after the manner of theHebrews, nor perform what was agreeable to their laws, in mar­rying a foreign wife, and one that transgressed the accurate ap­pointments of their sacrifices and religious ceremonies ; that heought to consider, lest by allowing himself in many pleasures ofthe body, he might lose his principality, on account of the beau­ty of a wife, and that high authority which, by God's blessing,he had arrived at.

ORTHAGORIA. and other modern cilitrtrs have received Into the textIt is, however, right to observe that the district ofUropus was frequently designated as the bordercountry or country over the burder (tijs irtpav yijs,Thuc.'iii 01). According to Dicaearchua (L c.) the Oropianswere notorious for their grasping exactions, leviedupon all imports into their country, and were forthis reason satirised by Xenon, a comic poet:— TldvTfs TtKuvai, irdi'Tts uatv ayiraycf.Kanuv r(\os ytvoiTO toTv 'Clpaiitiots. The position of Oropus is thus defined by Strabo,"Tlit* beginning [of Boeotia] is Oropus, and thesacred harbour, which they call Delphinium, op­posite to which is old Eretria in Kuboea, distant 6Ustadia. After Delphinium is Oropus at the distanceof 20 stadia, opj.n-.tte to wliicli is the present Kre-tria, distant 4(1 stadia. Then comes I>elium."(Strab. ix. p. 403.) The modern village of Oropostands at the distance of nearly two miles from thesea, on the right brink of the Vouricni, anciently*]the Asopus: it contains sonic fragments of ancientbuddings and sepulchral stones. There are alsoHellenic remains at the 2xdAa or wharf upon thebay, from which persons usually embark for Kuboea:this place is also called 4 J to us ayiovs anwroAouy.from a ruined church dedicated to I lie 14 HolyApostles." Leake originally place 1 Ornpus a:(front! and Delphinium at Skuhti but in the secondedition of his Demi he leaves the position of On'pusdoubtful. It seems, however, most probable thatOropus originally stood upon the coast, and was re­moved inland or.Iy for a short time. In the Pelo-ponne-dan War Tliucydides speaks of sailing to andanchoring at Oropus (iii. 91, viii. 95); and 1'nu-sanias, :i>, we have already seen, expressly .statesthat Oropus was upon the coast. Hence there canbe lit!Ic doubt that Skala is the site t>f Oropus andthat Ortypo is the inland site which the Oropiansoccupied only for a time. It is true that the dis­tance of Oropo from the sea is more than double the7 stadia assigned by Diodorus, but it is jxissihlethat he may have originally written 17 stadia. IfOropus stood at Skdla, Delphinium must have beenmore to the eastward nearer the conlines of Attica. In the territory of i tropuswas the celebrated templeof the hero Amphiaraus. According to Pausanias(i. 34. § 1) it was 12 stadia distant from Oropus.Strabo [-laces it in the district of Psnphis, whichstood between Rhamnus and Oropus, and which wassubsequently an Attic dermis (ix. p. 399), Livycalls it tlie temple of Amphilochus (xlv. 27), who,we know from 1'ausanias. was worshipped conjointlywith Amphiaraus, Livy further de.-cribes it as aplace rendered agreeable by fountains and rivers;w hich leads one to look for it at one of two torrentswhich join the yea between Skdla and Kalamo,which i> probably the ancient I'sophis. The m»uthof one ofthe.se torrents is distant about a mile anda half from Ska la ; at half a mile from tlie mouthare some remains of antiquity. The Other torrent isabout three miles further to the eastward; onwhich, at a mile above the plain, are remains ofancient walls. This place, which is near K a la mo,is called Marro-DhUissi, the epithet Macro (black)distinguishing it from DhiUssi, the site of Delium.The distance of the Hellenic remains on the first-mentioned torrent agree with tin* 12 stadia ofPausanias: but, on the other hand, inscriptionshave been found at Macro DhHusi and Kalamo, in which the name of Amphiaraus occur, tfcwchus (/. r.) describes tlie road from Athets tu**r*}*as leading through bay-trees {ha fov&vibv*) a.the temple of Amphiaraus.

Angela) was built byHadrian when he founded his mausoleum, to whichit directly leads. (Spart. Hadr. 19.) In tlie timeof the Anonymous of Einsiedlen, who has preservedthe inscription, it was called Pons S. Petri. Butbefore the time of Hadrian there was a bridgewhich connected the district of the Vatican with thecity near the gardens of Caligula ami Nero, remainsof which still exist near S, SpiritO. Tins is probablythe bridge which is called in the Mirabilia " PonsNeronianus," and by the ancient topographers"Pons Vath ancs." The Pons Triumphauslias also been sometimes identified with this bridge;hut Piranesi, who is followed by Bunsen, places thePons Triumphalis above tlie Aelian bridge; and itis said that there are still remains of one of the pilesnear Tor di Xoua. But in the time of Procopiusthese had disappeared, and the Pons Aelius formedthe only communication between the city and theVatican district The Pons Aurvijus was most probably thepresent Ponte. Sistot leading to the .laniculum andthe Porta Amelia. It appears to have been calledPons Antonini s in the middle ages. What thePons Probi may have been it is impossible to say,Becker assigns the name to the bridge by thePorta Trigemina, but merely because, having deniedthat to be the Sublicins, he has nowhere else toplace it. Canins, on the contrary (/mite. p. 609},places it where we have placed the Pons Amelias. XVIII. Aqueducts. In the time of Frontinus there were at Home nineprincipal aqueducts, viz., tlie Appia, Anio Vet us,Marcia, Tepula, Julia, Virgo, Alsietina, Claudia,Anio Novus; and two subsidiary ones, the Augustaand Rivus Uercnlaneus. (Aq, 4.) Between thetime of Frontinus and that of Procopius their num­ber had considerably increased, since the latter his­torian relates that the Goths destroyed 14 aque­ducts that were without the walls. (B. G. i. 19.)The Xottiiu enumerates 19, viz. tlie Trajana, Annia,Attica, Marcia, Claudia, Hercules, Cerulea, Julia,Augustea, Appia, Alseatina, Ciminia, Aurelia,Damnata, Virgo, Tepula, Sevcriana, Antooiniana,Alexandrina. To enter into a complete history ofall these would almost require a separate treatise;. and we shall therefore confine ourselves to a state­ment of the more important particulars concerningthem, referring those readers who are desirous ofmore information on the subject to the Dictionaryof Antiquities, art. Aquakductus. The Aqua APPIA was, as we have already re­lated, the first aqueduct conferred on Home by thecare of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus, afterwhom it was named. It commenced on theVia Praeneattna, between the 7th and 8th mile­stone, and extended to the Salinae, near the Porta'1 rigemina.

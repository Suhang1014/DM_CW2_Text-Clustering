[E.B.J.] OETA (Qtrn: Eth. Orrcuot), a mountain in thesouth of Thessaly, which branches off from Mt.Pindus, runs, in a south-easterly direction, and formsthe northern barrier of Central Greece. The onlyentrance into Central Greece from the north isthrough the narrow opening left between Mt. Oetsand the sea, celebrated as the pass of Thermopylae.[Thermopylae]. Mt. Oeta is now called Katavo-thra, and its highest summit is 7071 feet. (Journalof Geogr. Soc. vol. vii. p. 94.) The mountain im­mediately above Thermopylae is called Callidromonboth by Strabo and I.ivy. (Strab. ix. p. 428; Liv.xxxvi. 15.) The latter writer says that Callidro­mon is the highest summit of Mt. Oeta; and Straboagrees with him in describing the summit nearest toThermopylae as the highest part of the range; butin this opinion they were both mistaken, Mt. Patrio-tika, which lies more to the west, being considerablyhigher. Strabo describes the proper Oeta as 200stadia in length. It is celebrated in mythology as thescene of the death of Hercules, whence the Romanpoets give to this hero the epithet of Oetaeus. Fromthis mountain the southern district of Thessaly wascalled Oetaea (OiVaTo, Strab. ix. pp. 430, 432. 434),and its inhabitants Oetaei (Oi'tcuoi, Herod, vii. 217;Thuc. iii. 92; Strab. ix. p. 416). There was also acity, Oeta, said to have been founded by Amphissus,son of Apollo and Dryope (Anton. Liberal, c. 32),which Stephanus B. (*. r.) describes as a city of theMalians. Leake places it at the foot of SIt. Patri-otiko, and conjectures that it was the same as thesacred city mentioned by Callimachus. (//ymn. inZW.287.)

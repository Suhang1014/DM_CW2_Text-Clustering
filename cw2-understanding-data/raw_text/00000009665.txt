OCR Output DISCOURSE I. xxxix finished. The eighth, though moulded into due form, hathplainly not had a final revisal, and breaks off abruptly. Thewhole work is said to have fallen into Xenophon's possession,who, at the time of the death of Thucydides, was exiled fromAthens: And Xenophon is also said to have made it public.This carries a great air of probability with it, since Xenophonbecame the continuator of Thucydides, not in so lofty andmajestic, but in a sweeter and more popular style. There isa chasm indeed between the time the History of Thucydidesbreaks off, and the Grecian- History of Xenophon begins.There is no accounting for this but by conjecture. May Iventure to offer one, I believe entirely new, but which, forthat reason, I shall readily give up to the first person of judg­ment, who thinks it hath no foundation ? It is this—ThatThucydides left somewhat more behind him than now ap­pears. How it came to be suppressed or lost, I will not pre­tend to guess. It is natural to imagine, that his acknow­ledged continuator resumed the subject at the very spotwhere his predecessor had left off. Nearly two years arehowever wanting, in which several important incidents tookplace. It is pity, but we have no redress. General histo­rians are by other means enabled to supply the deficiency;but the loss of any thing from so masterly a hand is still tobe regretted. The place of the death and interment of Thucydides wasmost probably Scaptesyle in Thrace. Long habitude mighthave made him fond of a spot, where he had passed so manyyears in studious and calm retirement. The hurry and bus­tle and engagements of Athens could not have been much tothe relish of so grave, and now so old a man. His monu­ment there among the Cimonian confirms this opinion, sincemost writers agree, it had the mark upon it which shewed itto be a cenotaph, and the words, Here lieth, were not in theinscription*. I have nothing to add about his family. It is • M&rcellinus.

B.*. t). terms them a Molossian tribe), were unitedwith the other Epirots, under their prince Antiochus,in support of the expedition of Cneinus and the Am-braciots against Acarnania. Afterwards they wereincorporated in the Macedonian kingdom. In thepeace finally granted to Philip, B c. 196, by theRomans, the Orestae were declared free, becausethey had been the first to revolt.

This subdivision of UpperMacedonia is represented by the modern districts ofGrdmista, Anatelitza, and Kastoria. (Leake,/Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 305, vol. iv. pp. 121—124.) [E.

Its inhabitants were re­moved to Megalopolis on the foundation of the lattercity. Its territory is called Orestliit by Thucydides(iv. 134), and in it was situated Ladoceia, whichbecame a suburb of Megalopolis. [Ladoceia.]Leake places Oresthasium at or near the ridge ofTzimbaru, and conjectures that it may have occu­pied the site of the village of Marmara or Marnui-ria, a name often attached in Greece to places whereancient wrought or sculptured stones have beenfound.

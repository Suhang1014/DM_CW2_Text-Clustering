Fellows (JJucov. in Lycia, p. 196, &c),and in Texier's work (Uetcription de t Atk Mineure),where the ruins are figured in 22 plates. Thetheatre at Myra, says Sir Charles, is among thelargest and the best built in Asia Minor: much ofits fine corridor and corniced proscenium remains.The number of tombs cut in the rock is not large,but they are generally very spacious, and consistof several chambers communicating with one another.Their external ornaments are enriched by sculpturedstatues in the rocks around ; but they are mostlywithout inscriptions (see the plate of one in Sir C.Fellows' Discov. facing p. 198, and numerous othersin a plate facing p. 200). On the whole, the ruinsof Myra are among the most beautiful in Lycia.(Comp. Spratt and Forbes, Travels m Lycia, vol. i.p. 131, &c.) [L. S.] MYRCINUS (Mif/wiroj, Stcph. B.; MiVk.wos,Tzctz.

It offered great advantages tosettlers, as it contained an abundant supply oftimber for shipbuilding, as well as silver mines.(Herod, vii. 23.) Aristagoras retired to this place,and, scon after landing, perished before some Thra-cian town which he was besieging. (Herod v. 126;Thuc iv. 102.) Afterwards, it had fallen into thehands of the Edoni; but on the murder of Pittacus,chief of that people, it surrendered to Brasidas.(Thuc iv. 107.)

Pliny(v. 32) mentions that it bore the surname ofSehastopolis; while, according to Syncellus, it wasalso called Smyrna. For some time Myrina wasoccupied by Philip of Macedonia; but the Romanscompelled him to evacuate it, and declared the placefree. (Liv. I. c j Polyh. xviii. 27.) It was twicevisited by severe earthquakes; first in the reign ofTibeiine (Tac. Ann. ii. 47), on which occasion itreceived a remission of duties on account of the lossit had sustained; and a secmid time in the reign ofTrajan (Oros. vii. 12). The town was restored eachtime, and continued to exist until a late period.(Staph. Byz. '. v.; Plot. v. 2. § 6; Apolloa. Rhod. i.C04; tlinot-l. p. 661; tieogr.

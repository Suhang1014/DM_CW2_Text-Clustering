OCR Output THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. BOOK VII. (JYLIPPUS and Pythen, when they had refittedtheir ships, stood along the coast from Tarentum toLocri Epizephyrii. Here they received more certaininformation, that Syracuse was not yet completely in­vested, and that a succour of force.might be throwninto the town by the way of Epipolæ. They went nextto consultation, — whether, "keeping Sicily on the** right, they should endeavour at all hazards to enter*' Syracuse by sea; or, with Sicily on their left, should*' steer first to Himera from whence, attended by"the forces of that State and whatever additional"strength they could persuade to join them, they should"march thither over-land." It was determined to gofirst to Himera, especially as the four Athenian vesselswere not yet arrived at Rhegium, which Nicias at last,upon the certain intelligence that they were now atLocri, had detached to observe them. To be before­hand, therefore, with this detachment, they passthrough the straits, and, having touched only at Rhe­gium and Messene, arrive at Himera: whilst, in thelatter place, they prevailed upon the Himereans to con­cur with them in the war, and not only to entrust theirtroops under their command, but even to supply witharms such of the mariners as had navigated the vessels,and were therefore unprovided; for, their shippingthey had drawn ashore, and laid up at Himera.

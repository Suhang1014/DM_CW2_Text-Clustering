OCR Output OF THE ROMAN EMPIHE. the inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was C**£P.stained with the royal blood of two guests and allies,'inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their pre­sence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was thesame: but the cruel death of their sovereign was re­sented in a very different manner by the servile tem­per of the Armenians, and the free and daring spiritof the Germans. The Quadi were much declinedfrom that formidable power, which, in the time ofMarcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates ofRome. But they still possessed arms and courage;their courage was animated by despair, and they ob­tained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of theirSarmatian allies. So improvident was the assassinMarcellinus, that he chose the moment when thebravest veterans had been drawn away, to suppressthe revolt of Firmus; and the whole province wasexposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage ofthe exasperated Barbarians. They invaded Panno-nia in the season of harvest; unmercifully destroyedevery object of plunder which they could not easilytransport; and either disregarded, or demolished,the empty fortifications. The princess Constantia,the daughter of the emperor Constantius, and thegrand-daughter of the great Constantine, very nar­rowly escaped.

Shetraversed the peaceful province with a splendid andunarmed train. Her person was saved from danger,and the republic from disgrace, by the active zeal ofMessala, governor of the provinces. As soon as hewas informed that the village, where she stoppedonly to dine, was almost encompassed by the Barba­rians, he hastily placed her in his own chariot, anddrove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium,which were at the distance of six-and-twenty miles.

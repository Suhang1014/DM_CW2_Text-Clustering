Strab.xiv. p. 665) that it was one of the six cities form­ing the Lycian confederacy. Strain only remaiksfurther that it was situated on the road to Cihyra.(Comp. Plin. v. 28; Ptol. v. 3. § 5; Steph. B. «. v.;Hierocl. p. 659.) Until recently the site of thistown was unknown, though D'Anviile liad correctlyconjectured that it ought to be looked for in the val­ley of the Xanthus. Sir C. Fellows was the first mo­dem traveller who saw and described its beautifulremains, the identity of which is established beyonda doubt by inscriptions. These ruins exist in theupper valley of the Xanthus, at a little distancefrom its eastern bank, almost due north of the cityof Xanthus, and about 5 miles from the village ofDuover. They arc, says Sir Charles, very extensive,Consisting of extremely massive buildings, suitedonly for palaces; the design appears to be Roman,but not the mode of building nor the inscriptions.The original city must have been demolished in veryearly times, and the finely wrought fragments arenow seen built into the strong walls, which havefortified the town raised upon its ruins. The thea­tre was large, and the must highly and expensivelyfinished thnt he had seen; the seats not only are ofmarble, but the marble is highly wrought and hasbeen polished, and each seat has an overhangingcornice often supported by lions* paws. There arealso ruins of several other extensive buildings withcolumns; but the most striking feature in the placeis the perfect honeycomb formed in the sides of theacropolis by excavated tombs, which are cut out ofthe rock with architectural ornaments, in the formof triangles, &c, some showing considerable taste.(Kellows, Asia Minor, p. 237, foil., Lycia, p. 139,toll., where gome of the remains are figured and anumber of inscriptions given.) [L. S.] TMARUS. [Dodoha, p. 783, b.] TMOLUS (T^wAos), a mountain range on the(south of Sard OS, forming the watershed between thebasins of the Hermus in the north and the Caysterin the south, and being connected in the east withMount Messogis. It was said to have received itsname from a Lydian king Timolus, whence Ovid{Met, vi. 16) gives this name to the mountain it­self. Mount Tmolus was celebrated for the ex­cellent wine growing on its slop's (Virg. (ieorg. n.97; ixurv.P/ioen. 602; Kurip. Bacch. 55,64; Strab.xiv. p. 637; Plin. v. 30). It was equally rich inmetals ; and the river I'actolus, which had its sourcein Mount Tmolus, at one time carried from its in­terior a rich supply of gold. (Strab. xiii. pp. 591,610, 625; Plin. xxxiii. 43; comp. Horn. //. ii. 373;Aeach. Vers. 50; Herod, i. 84, 93, v. 101; Ptol. v.2. § 13; Dion. Per. 831.) On the highest summitof Mount Tmolus, the Persians erected a marblewatch-tower commanding a view of the whole of thesurrounding country (Strab. xiii. p. 625). The Turksnow call the mountain Bouz Dagh. (Kichter, Wall-faJtrten, pp. 512, 519.) [L.

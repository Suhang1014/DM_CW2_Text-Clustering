Hence we read in Virgil: Sa-cramque exhalat opaca Mefitim. Aen. 7, 64. Murphy. This portion of the history furnishes a very good illustration of ourauthor's characteristic power of description. The rapid succession ofbloody battles and sieges, in which Antonius and his followers foughtlike tigers, nay like demons, through two days and the interveningnight, defeated three separate armies in three successive encounterswithout intermission, and carried two distinct and strongly fortifiedlines of defence—walls, towers and bulwarks—around Cremona, issketched with a rapidity and force fully adequate to the subject. Theoutward movements and the inward motives of tho men are set beforethe eye of the reader with equal distinctness. And finally the burningand sacking of the city presents a picture of unrestrained passions, ofunbounded crimes, of dreadful calamities and sufferings, of utter deso*lation and ruin, to which history and even the drama with all its wildlicense of imagined horrors can furnish few parallels. The student,who has failed to perceive the historian's power, has read" the passageto little purpose, and will do well to read it again. In default of allother means of appreciating it, he will find the passage well represent­ed in Murphy's translation, though not with all the conciseness, forceand fire of the original. Cf.

It is also recorded inthe fragments of the Argive Iwoks as seated on theColli* Mucialis (Varr. /,./.. v.§ 62, MuTl.),which hillcomes next in order after the Collis Salutaris. Wehave already mentioned the temple of Quirinus ashaving been situated near the present church ofS. Andrea and it may therefore be assumed that thePorta Sanqualis spanned the ascent to it at or nearthe modern Via d#Un Dataria. Between the PortaSanqualis and theCapitolinehillthere were probably two gates : at all events theremust undoubtedly have been one in the very narrowravine which in early times separated the Capitolinefrom the Quirinal, and which a Horded the onlyoutlet from the neighbourhood of the forum. Thiswas, perhaps, the Porta Ratumena, which welearn from Pliny (viii.65: "undo postea nomen esV)and Plutarch (Popl. 13: wapa tV ttvKyv, vvv'Varovfxivav koXovitiv) was still existing in their time.Becker, indeed, disputes the inference of its existencefrom Pliny's words,and disbelieves the assertion of Plu­tarch. But there is nothing at all incredible in the fact,and therefore no reason why we should disbelieve it.We know, from the* example of London and other cities,that a gate, and especially the name of agate markingits former site, may remain for ages after the wallin which it stood has been removed. Even the localtradition of its name would have sufficed to mark itssite; but it seems highly probable, from the natureof the ground where it stood, that the gate itself hadbeen preserved. The road through so narrow a gorgecould never have been disturbed for building or otherpurjioses; and it is probable that the gate remained.standing till the ravine was enlarged by cutting awaythe Quirinal in order to make room for Trajan'storn in. We learn from the passages just cited, uswell as from Fest us (p. 274"), that the gate derivedits name from a charioteer, who, returning victoriousfrom the Circen>ian games at Veii, was thrown outof his chariot and killed at this spot, whilst t'-ieaffrighted horses, thus freed from all control, dashedup the Capitoline hill, and, as the legend runs, did notfinish their mad career till they bad thrice made thecircuit of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. (Plin.viii. 65.) So remarkable an omen would have beenquite a sufficient ground in those days for changingthe name of the gate. But it matters little whatfaith we may be disposed to place in the legend; for Sir s^st^] w^^r — =7 - - 1 '; e f r11 1 r !i 1 c ■ PCFLi'.'iL -w-PH.L'T -a*::!

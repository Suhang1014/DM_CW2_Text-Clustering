ROMAN HISTORY. 435 with a riew to make them the authors of,his own male­volence, had submitted an affair to them, which entirelydepended on himself; nor to the senate, but to the fa­mily of the Liciui, a son whereof had laid the matter be­fore the senate, and his father had strongly espoused theinterest of the people, in supporting the motion. After all the worldly riches had been removed fromVeil, they began to remove what had been consecratedto the geds, and the gods themselves; but in this theyacted more like worshippers than pillagers. For some ofthe youngest men of the whole army were selected, towhom, wheii their bodies were washed perfectly clean,and clothed in white, it was given in charge to transportqueen Juno to Rome: They entered her temple with re­verence, touching her at first with a religious awe, be­cause that statue, by a ceremony among the Etrurians,none used to. touch, but a priest of a certain family. Atlast when one of the lads, whether by a divrne impulse,pr in a youthful frolic, asked her, 'Will you go to Rome,'Juno?' 'Yes, yes, (cried they altogether,) you see the'goddess nods her assent;' which gave rise to the story,that she was heard to pronounce distinctly, ' With all'my heart.' Certain it is, that she was easily movedfrom her place, and that they got her to Rome, with aslittle trouble or difficulty as if she had followed them.They conveyed' her safe and sound to the Aventine hill,whither the dictator had invited heV; and which- wasfrom'that time to be the seat of her residence for ever:and where he dedicated a temple to her, in discharge ofa vow he had made. Such was the fate of Veii, the richest city of all Tus­cany; the final ruin of which, demonstrated its great­ness: for having sustained an unremitted siege for tensummers and as many winters, wherein Rome had suf­fered more from it, than it had done from Rome, it wasat last, by unavoidable destiny, reduced not by force,. bus­by stratagem. .

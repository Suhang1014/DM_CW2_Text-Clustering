Tlicbes was indebted for its greatness originally toits being the principal centre of Ammon-worship,—aworship which, on the one hand, connected it withMeroe, and, on the other, with the islands of theLibyan desert. The strength which the Thebaic!and its capital thus acquired not only enabled it torise superior to Abydus in the earlier period, but alsoto expel the Assyrian invaders from the Delta. Itheroines then an interesting question which quarterof Thelitis was its cradle? Did it spread itself fromthe eastern or the western shore of the Nile? BothDiodorus and Strabu are agreed in placing the "oldtown," wiili its Aiuinonian temple, on the easternbank of the river; and this site too was the more acces­sible of the two, whether its population came fromthe left or, as it is more likely they did. from theright shore. Between Luxor and Karnak lies theclaim to be considered as the site of the earliestDiospolis. Now in the former place there is 110 con­spicuous trace of Amnion - worship, whereas thelatter, in its ram-headed dromoi, abounds with sym­bols of it. At Knntak, every monument attests thepresence of Amnion. Osiris indeed appears as hi?son or companion on the sculptures, and in some ofthe temple-legends they were represented as jointfounders of the shrine. But Amnion was withoutdoubt the elder of the two. We may accordinglyinfer that the tirst Thebes stood nearly on the site ,■if the present Kumak, at a period anterior to allrecord: that it exjianded towaids the river, and wasM'parated by the whole breadth of the stream and ofthe plain to the foot of the Libyan hills from thenecropolis. Finally, that as its population becamelarge for the precincts of the eastern plain, asuburb, which grew into a second city, arose on theupjwsite bank of the Nile; and thus the originaldistinction between eastern and western Thebes par­tially disappeared, and the river, having thencefor­ward habitations on both its banks, no longer partedby a broad barrier the city of the living from the cityof the dead. (Kenrick, Ancient Atgypt under (he Pharaohs,vol. i. pp. 149—178; Hceren, Historical Hvsearches,Thebes and its Afimumeiiti, vol. ii. pp. 201—342;Champollion, /Mtres sitr lE>j>ipte; Hamilton,Atg>/ptUicti; IJeUoni, Travels, cfc.) The territory of Thebes was named Thebais (ijOnSafy, sc. X^P0^ or °* &vta t6ttoi} the UpperCountry, Ptol. iv. 5- i$ 62), the modern *Sai> orJ>athrvs} and was olio of the three principal divi­sions of Aegypt. Its frontiers to the S. varied ac­cordingly as Aegypt or Aethiopia preponderated, theThebau Pharaohs at times ruling over the regionabove the Cataracts as far S. as Hiera Sycaniinalat. 23'-* 6' N.; while, at others, the kings of Meroeplanted their garrisons N. of Syene, and, at oneperiod, occupied the Thebais itself. But the ordi­nary limits of Upper Aegypt were Syene to S., lat24° 5' X., and Hcnnopolis Magna to N., lat. 27° 45'X. On the K. it was bounded by the Arabian, onthe W. by the Libyan hills and desert. Aa rainseldom falls in the Thebais (Herod, iii. 10), and asit.^ general surface is rocky or sandy, the breadth ofi-nitivable laud depends on the alluvial deposit of theNile, and this again is regulated by the conformationof the banks on either side. For a similar causethe ]»optilation of the Thebais was mostly gatheredinto towns and large villages, both of which areoften dignified by ancient writers with the appella­tion of cities. But numerous cities were incom­patible with the physical character of this region, and its population must have been cs^iMbelow the estimate of it by the Greeks an: The Thebais was divided into ten iwaw; y.rV :r .p. 787), and consequently ten halls in uV U;.*t.^lwere appropriated to its Nonarehs.

The Cadmeia is again divided by a slightdepression near I lie foantain of I)irce and the Cre-naean gate into two hills, of which the larger andthe higher one to the south was the aciopolisproper, and was called the Cadmeia kolt ify>)ptPtwhile the northern hill formed the agora of theacropolis (tt/s aKpono\«as ayupd, Pans. ix. 12.§ 3). The eastern half of the city was also dividedbetween the Strophia and the Lsmeuus into two parts,of which the southern consisted of tlie hill Ismenius,and the northern of several minor eminences, knownunder the general name of Atnpheion. ('Afxpuov,Arrian, Anab. i. 8.) Aeschylus describes the tombof Amphion as standing near the northern gate.(Bo^atcus trvKais TvfiGov kot' avrbv Atoytvovs'&fjL<p[ovos, Sept. c. Thtb. :")28.) llence Thebes con­sisted of four parts, two belonging to the acropolis,and two to the lower city, the former being theacropolis proper and the agora of the acropolis, andthe latter being the hill [sinenius and the Ampheion. Pausanias, leaving Potniae, entered Thebes on thesouth by the gate Electrae, before which lie noticedthe Polyandriuin, or tomb of the Thebaus who fellfighting against Alexander. (Pans. ix. 8. §§3.4, 7,ix. 10. § 1.) The explanation of Forchhammer thatAlexander laid siege to the city on the south, andthat he did not return from the gate Electrae tothe Proetides, as Leake supposes, seems the mustprobable. Accordingly the double lines of circum-vallalion, which the Thebans erected against theMacedonian garrison in the Cadmeia, must havebeen to the south of the city around the chief gatesof the Cadmeia. (See Arrian, i. 7, 8.) Upon enter­ing the city through the gate Electrae, Pausaniasnotices the bill lsmemus sacred to Apollo, namedfrom the river Isinenus flowing by it (ix. 10. § 2).ITpon the hill was a temple of Apollo, containingseveral monuments enumerated by Pausanias. Thistemple is likewise mentioned by Pindar and Hero­dotus, both of whom sj>eak of the tripods situated inits treasury. (Pind./ty/A. xi. 7,6eq.; Herod, v. 59.)Above the Ismeniuin, Pausanias noticed the fountainof the Isinenus, sacred to Ares, and guarded by adragon, the name of which fountain was Melia, aswe have already seen (ix. 10. § 5). Next Pausanias, beginning again from the gateElectrae, turns tu the left and enters the Cadmeia(ix. 11. § I, seq.). He does not mention the acro-polis by name, but it is evident from the list of themonuments which he gives that lie was in tlie Cad­meia. He enumerates tlie house of Amphitryon,containing the bedchamber of Alcmena, said to havebeen the work of Trophonius and Agamedes ; a mo­nument of the children of Hercules l»y Megara; thestone called Sophronister; the temple of Hercules('Ht>a.K\ciov, Arrian, Anab. i. S); and. near it, agymnasium and stadium, both bearing the name ofthis (iod; and above the Sophronister an altar ofApollo Spodius. Pausanias next came to the depression between theacropolis and the agora of the Cadmeia, where henoticed an altar and statue of Athena, bearing thePhoenician surname of Onga ("Oyya), or Or.ca("O-ytca) according to other authorities, and said tohave been dedicated by Cadmus (ix. 12. § 2). Weknow from Aeschylus that there was originally atemple of Athena Onca in this locality, which stoodoutside the city near one of the gates, whence thegoddess was called ayx'nrroKu. Some derived the ■ name from a village named Onca or Oacse. i'.W:.Sept. c. Thch. 163, 487, 501, with ScbnL:fe**in EuripuL 7'Aottt 1069 ; Steph. B. *. r 0>«««;Hesych. a. p. 'O-yaw; SchoL arf /W.

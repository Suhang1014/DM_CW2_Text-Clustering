LYCTUS, LYTTUS (Awrrot, Auttoj: Eth.Awrnoi, Ai/ttioj, Ptol. iii. 17. § 10), one of themost considerable cities in Crete, which appears inthe Homeric catalogue. (/£ ii. 647, xvii. 611.)According to the Hesiodic Theogony (J'heog. 477),Kbra gave birth to Zeus in a cave of Mt. Acgaeon,war Lvctus. The inhabitants of this ancient Doriccity called themselves colonists of Sparta (Arist,Pol ii. 7), and the worship of Apollo appears tohave prevailed there. (Callim. Hymn. Apoll. 33 jcomp. Miiller, Dorians, vol. i. pp. 141, 227, trans.)In B. c. 344, I'balaecns the Pliocian assisted theCno-sians (gainst their neighbours the Lyctians,ind took the city of Lvctus, from which he wasdriven out by Archidamus, king of Sparta. (Diod.ivi. 62.) Tlie Lyctians, at a still later period, wereMipjgui in frequent hostilities with Cnossus, andsucceeded in creating a formidable party in theisland against that city. The Cnossians, takingadvantage of their absence on a distant expedition,surprised Lyctus, and utterly destroyed it. Thecitiwns, on "their return, abandoned it, and foundrefuge at Lampa. Polybius (iv. 53, 54), on thisoccasion, bears testimony to the high character ofthe Lyctians, as compared with their countrymen.They afterwards recovered their city by the aid oftbe Gortynians, who gave them a place called Dia-tonium, which they had taken from the Cnossians.(Polyb. xxiiL 15, xiiv. 53.) Lyctus was sackedby ifetellus at the Roman conquest (Liv. Epil.xrix.; Flor. iii. 7), but was existing in the time ofStrafco (x. p. 479) at a distance of 80 stadia fromthe Libyan sea. (Slrab. p. 476; comp. Steph. B.a. v.; Scyl. p. 18; Plin. iv. 12; Hesyth. *. v. Kap-rrpaitokis; Hierocl.) The Bite still bears themine of Lyrto, where ancient remains are now found.(Pathley, Trav. vol. i. p. 269.) In the 16th cen­tury, the Venetian MS. (J/tM. Clou. Ant. vol. ii.p. 274) describes the walls of the ancient city, withcircular bastions, and other fortifications, as existingupon a lofty mountain, nearly in the centre of thebland. Numerous vestiges of ancient structures,totnbs, and broken marbles, are seen, as well as animmense arch of an aqueduct, by which the water"as carried across a deep valley by means of a largemarble channel. The town of Aiuhkoe and thehirtour of Chersoxesus are assigned to Lyctus.Tbe type on its coins is usually an eagle flying,.with the epigraph ATTTlilN.

LYCU'BIA (AvKovpla), a village in Arcadia,which still retai a its ancient name, marked theIwradariei of the Plicncatae and Cleitorii. (Paus.via. 19. § 4; Leake, Morea, vol. iii. p. 143;BoMaye, Herhtrches, ifc. p.. 156; Curtius, Pclo-l"**aos, voL I p. 198.) LYCUS (AiS/cor), is the name of a great manyrivers, especially in Asia, and seems to have ori­ginated in the impression made upon the mind of thebeholder by a torrent rushing down the side of ahill, which suggested the idea of a wolf rushing athis prey. The following rivers of this name occurin Asia Minor: — 1. The Lycus of Bithynia: it flows in the east ofBithynia in a western direction, and empties itselfinto the Euxine a little to the south of Herat leiaPontica, which was twenty stadia distant from it.The breadth of the river is stated to have been twoplethra, and the plain near its mouth bore the nameof Campus Lycaeus. (Scylax, p. 34; Orph. Ar­gon. 720; Arrian, Peripl. p. 14; Anonym. Peripl.p. 3; Xcnopb. Anub. vi. 2. § 3; Ov. Epist. exPont. x. 47; Memnon, ap. Phot. 51; Plin. vi. 1,who erroneously states that Heme leia was situatedon (appositum) the river.) 2. The Lycus of Cilicia is mentioned only byPliny (v. 22) as flowing between the Pyramus andPinarus. 3. The Lycus of Lydia was a tributary of theHermua, flowing in a south-western direction by thetown of Thyatira: whether it emptied itself directlyinto the Hermus, or only after its juncture withthe Hyllus, is uncertain. (Plin. v. 31; comp.W'heler, vol. i. p. 253; P.Lucas, TroUieme Voy­age, vol. i. p. 139, who, however, confounds thoLycus with the Hermns.) 4. The Lycus of Phrygia, now called Tchoruk-Sii, is a tributary of the Maeander, which it joinsa few miles south of Tripoli*. It bad its sources inthe eastern parts of Mount Cadmus (Strab. xii.p. 578), not tar from those of the Maeander itself,and flowed in a western direction towards Colossae,near which place it disappeared in a chasm of theearth; after a distance of five stadia, however, itswaters reappeared, and, after flowing close by Lao-diceia, it discharged itself into tho Maeander.(Herod, vii. 30; Plin. v. 29; Ptol. v. 2. § 8;Hamilton, Researches, vol. i. p. 508, &c, andJournal of the Royal Geogr. Soc. vii. p. 60, whore-discovered the chasm in which the Lycus disap­pears, amid the ruins near Chonas.) 5. Pontus contained two rivers of this name: —(re.) A tributary of the Iris in the west, is now calledKulei Ilissar. It has its sources in the hills ofLesser Armenia, and, after flowing for some time ina western direction, it turns towardsthe north, pass­ing through Nicopolis, and emptying itself into theIris at Magnopolis. The Lycus is almost as im­portant a river as the Iris itself (Strab. xi. p. 529,xii. pp. 547, 556; Plut Lucid. 15; Plin. vi.3, 4; Ov. Epist. ex Pont. iv. 10, 47; Hierocl.p. 703; Act. Martyr, vol. iii. Jul. p. 46). (6.) Atributary of the Acampsis or Apsorrhos, in the east­ern part of Pontus, and is believed to answer to themodern Gorgoro. (Ptol. v. 6. § 7.) 6. According to Curtius (iii. 1), the river Mar-syas, which flowed through the town of Celamae,changed its name into Lycus at the point wheie itrushed out of the f rtifications of the place, [L. S.J LYCUS (Ai/'kov), a river of Assyria, also calledZabatus. [Zabatus.] LYCUS (AiSkos), a river of Syria, between an­cient Byblus and Berytus. (Strab. xvi. p. 755;Plin. v. 20.) Although both these geographersmention the river Adonis as distinct from this, inoieto the north, between Palae-Iiyblus and Byblus, thetwo rivers have been sometimes confounded. Their 42

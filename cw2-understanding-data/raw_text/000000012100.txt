VII.] AND THE SULPICIAN KEVOLUTION. 253 occupation of the Hirpinian territory the communicationwas broken off between the only two regions still perseveringin open resistance, the Samnite and the Lucano-Bruttian.The field of the insurrection resembled the scene of an im­mense conflagration dying out; everywhere the eye fell onashes and ruins and smouldering brands; here and therethe flame still blazed up among the ruins, but the fire waseverywhere mastered and there was no further threateningof danger. It is to be regretted, that we no longer suffi­ciently discern in the superficial accounts handed down tous the causes of this sudden revolution. While undoubtedlythe dexterous leadership of Strabo and still more of Sulla,the more energetic concentration of the Roman forces, andtheir quicker offensive action contributed materially to thatresult, political causes were probably at work along with themilitary in producing the singularly rapid fall of the insurgents'power; the law of Silvanus and Carbo probably fulfilled itsdesign in carrying defection and treason to the commoncause into the ranks of the enemy, and misfortune, as hasso frequently happened, probably fell as an apple of discordamong the loosely connected insurgent communities.

With astonishment men saw the Samnite wars be­ginning anew after a pause of two hundred years, and theresolute nation of farmers making a fresh attempt, just as in * The rare denarii with Safinim and G. Mutil in Oscan characters mustbelong to this period; for, as long as the designation Italia was retained bythe insurgents, no single canton could, as a sovereign power, coin money withits own name.

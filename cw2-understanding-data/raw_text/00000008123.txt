[Tude.] TYLK (Tv\n, Polyb. iv. 46), a town of Thrace,on the coast of the Euxine, where the Gauls esta­blished a seat of government (^curtAfioi'). and whichReichard identifies with Kilios. Steph. B. (p. G70)calls it Ti'-Ais, and places it on the Haemus. [J. R ] TVLISSUS. a town of Crete (Plin. iv. 20), theposition of which can only lie conjecture*!. On itsancient coins are found on the reverse a young manholding in his right hand the head of an ibex orwild gout, and in his left a bow. Theise types onthe coins of Tylissus led the most distinguishednumismatist of the last century (Kckhcl, vol- ii. p.321) to fix its situation somewhere between Cydoniaand Klvrus, the bow being common on the coius ofthe one, and the ibex's head on those of the other, ofthese two cities. Hock (Kreta. vol. i. p. 433) andTorres V. Ribera (Periplus Cretae, p. 324) adoptthis suggestion of Eckhel, and place Tylissus on thekS. coast at tlie W. extremity of the island near themodern &}lino~Kast>'ti.

S.] TYMBRES. a tributary of the Sangarius, in thenorth of Phrygia (Liv. xxxviii. 18), is in all pro­bability the same river as the one called by Pliny(vi. 1) Tembmgius, which joined the Sangarius, asLivy says, on the borders of Phrygia and Galatia,and, flowing in the plain of Dorylaeum, separatedPhrygia Epictetus from Phrygia Salutaris. It seemsalso to bo the same river as the Thvaris and Bathysmentioned in Bvzantme writers. (Cinnamus, v. 1. p.Ill ; Richter,iraZ//«/tr(«il p. 522. foil.) [L. S.] TYMPHAKA, TYMPHAEI.

Steph. B. s. v.). As it is statedthat the river Arachthus rose in Mt. Tymphe, andthat Aeginium was a town of the Tymphaei (Strab. vii. pp. 325, 327). Mt. Tymphc may be identified wiiltthe summits near Metzovo, and the Tymphaei maybe regarded as the inhabitants of the whole of theupper valley of the Peneins from Metzovo or Kal<i-bdka. The name is written in some editions uftStrabo, Stymphe and Stymphaei, and the form Stvm-phaea also occurs in Arrian (i. 7); but the ortho­graphy without the s is perhaj* to l>c preferred.

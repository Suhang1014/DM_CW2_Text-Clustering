Lorenzo, we have no road to assign to thenow closed gate adjoining the Praetorian camp, noryet to the Porta Vuninalis of tho Servian walls, acircumstance certainly remarkable, us it seems un­likely that sucli an opening should have been madein the agger without absolute necessity. On theother hand, the absence of all mention of that gateprior to the time of Strabo would lead one to suspectthat it was not one of the principal outlets of thecity; and a passage from Ovid, quoted by M. Becker,certainly affords some presumption that the roudfrom Tibur, in ancient times, actually entered thecity by the Porta EsquiHna {Fast. v. G84). Thisis, in fart, the mo.>t important, perhaps the onlyimportant, point of the question; for if the change inthe names had already taken place as early as thetime of Procopius, width Xiebuhr himself seemsdisposed to acknowledge; it is hardly worth whileto inquire whether the gate* had borne the sameappellations during the short interval from Honoriusto Justinian'' (Clots. Mus. vol. iii. p. 369, seq.). The Porta Tiburtina (S. Lorenzo) is built nearan arch of the Aquae Marcia, Tepula, and Julia,which here flow over one another in three differentcanals. The arch of the gate corresponds withthat of the aqueduct, but the latter is encumberedwith rubbish, and therefore appears very low, whilstthe gate is built on the rubbish itself. As the in­scription on it appeared on several of the othergates, we shall here insert it : S.P.Q.R. hupp. DD.XX. invictissimis pr'utripibns Arcadio et Honoriovictoribus et triumphatwibus semper Amjn. ob iti-atooratos nrbis aeteiime mttros portas uc turresegestis imnietisis ruderibus ex suggestions V.C. etinlustris com'ttU et magistri utriusqiie militiae Fl.StiUchoiiis ad perpetuitatem nominis eorum simu­lacra constituit curante Fl.

Book XL time; and she entreated God to have mercy upon her, and makeher words appear persuasive to the king, and render her counte­nance more beautiful than it was before, that both by her wordsand beauty she might succeed, for the averting of the king's an­ger, in case he were at all irritated against her, and for the con­solation of those of her own country, now they were in the ut­most danger of perishing; as also that he would excite a hatredin the king against the enemies of the Jews, and those that hadcontrived their future destruction, if they be proved to be con­temned by him. 9. When Esther had used this supplication for three days,she put off those garments, changed her habit, and adornedherself as became a queen, and took two of her hand-maids withher, the one of which supported her, as she gently leaned uponher, and the other followed after, and lifted up her large train(which swept along the ground,) with the extremities of herfingers: And thus she came to the king, having a blushing red­ness in her countenance, with a pleasant agreeableness in her be­haviour, yet did she go in to him with fear; and as soon as shewas come over against him, as he was sitting on his throne, inhis royal apparel, which was a garment interwoven with goldand precious stones, which made him seem to her more terrible,especially when he looked at her somewhat severely, and with acountenance on fire with anger, her joints failed her immediate­ly, out of the dread she was in, and she fell down sideways in aswoon: but the king changed his mind, which happened, as Isuppose, by the will of God, and was concerned for his wife,lest her fear should bring some very ill thing upon her, and heleaped from his throne and took her in his arms, and recoveredher, by embracing her, and speaking comfortably to her, andexhorting her to be of good cheer, and not to suspect any thingthat was said on account of her coming to him without beingcalled, because that law was made for subjects, but that she,who was a queen, as well as he a king, might be entirely se­cure : and as he said this, he put the sceptre into her hand, andlaid his rod upon her neck, on account of the law; and so freedher from her fear.

Around thissource are many hewn stones. In the face of theperpendicular rock, directly over the cavern and inoilier parts, several niches have l»een cut, apparentlyto receive statues. Each of these niches had oncean inscription; and one of them, copied by liurek-hardt, appear* to have been a dedication by a priestof Pan. There can he no doubt that this cavern isthe cave of Pan mentioned above; and the hewnstones around the spring may have belonged perhapsto the temple of Augustus.

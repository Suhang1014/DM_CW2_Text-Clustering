The part ot Gallia which borderedon Italy and was bounded on tlie south by the Medi­terranean was Gallia Provincia (Caen. B. G. i. 19),:i term by which Caesar sometimes distinguishesthis part of Gallia from the rest, which he fallsuomnia Gallia " (Ii. G. i. I) or " tota Gallia "(B.C.vii. C6). The Provincia in < laesar's time was boundedon the nnrth by the Rhone from the western extremityof the Lacus LemannuH (Lake of Geneva) to thejunction of t he Rhone and the Saone. Geneva, whichbelonged to the Allobrogcs, was the furthest town inth.it direction [GkxkyaJ. Along tlie southern sidetit'the Lahf of Geneva the limit was the boundarybetween the Allobroges who were in the Provinciaand the Nantuates who were not. (/>. G. iii. *>.)1 he Alps were the eastern boundary. <keelum[Ocei.Um] was in the Citerior I'rovincia or Gallia(.'isalpina, ami the country of the Vocontii was inthe Ulterior Provincia or in the I'rovincia Gallia(B. G. i. U>). On the west the Moot Ccvenna( Cerenncs) southward from the latitude of Lugdunum{/.>/<m) uas the boundary. The Volcae Arecomiciwere within the I'rovincia, and also tlie towns ofNarho (jVnrfronHe), Carcaso (Carauojott*;), and To­losa (Toulottge), as we see fi oin a passage in Caesar(B. G. iii. 20). Part of the Itnteni, called Provin-ctales (B. G. vii. 7), were in the I'rovincia; and alsotlif Helvii, who were separated from the Arverui bythe Cevenna (B. G. vii. 8). The Kutcni who werenot in the Provincia, the Gabali, Nitiobriges, andCadurci bordered on it on the west. The Roman troops were in this country during theSec ond Punic War when Hannibal was on his roadto Italy; but the Romans first got a footing therethrough the people of Massilia, who called tor theirhelp b.c. 154. In B.C. \'2'2 the Romans made asettlement, Aojiiae Sextiae (Atx), which we mayconsider to Ik; the commencement of their occupationof the country east of the Rhone. [GalUa, Vol. 1.p. 953.] The conquest of tlie Salves and Vocontii,and of the Allobroges, gave the Romans all thecountry on the east side of the Rhone, The settle­ment of Narbo (Xarbotme) in B.C. 118, near theborder of Spain and in a position which gave easyaccess to the basin of the Goronne,, secured the Ro­man dominion on the west side of the Rhone as faras the Pyrenees. But the Romans had many a bloodybattle to tic lit iN'fnre they were sale oil Gallic ground. *1 he capture of Tolosa ( Toulmm ) in tlie country ofthe Volcae Tcctnsages by the consul Q. ScrvilituCaepio (li. c. 106) extended the limits of the Pro­vincia as far as this rich town. (I)iun Cass. Fr. 97,&c.) Rut the Roman dominion was not safe even inv.. c. 58. when the proconsul Caesar received Galliaas one of his provinces. His subjugation ot" all Gallialinallv secured the Romans on that side. [Vol. I. p.954, &c] In the division of all Gallia by Augustus theI'rovincia retained its limits pretty nearly: ami it wasfrom this time generally called Niirboneusis Provincia,ami sometimes Gallia Braccata, The names whichoccur in the Greek writers are: K(ATo>a\OTi'a fittp-feVt'^jia (Ptol. ii. 10. § 1).

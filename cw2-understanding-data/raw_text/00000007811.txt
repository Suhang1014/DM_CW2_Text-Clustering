Aninscription found here would Beem to attest thatHurrintia existed as a municipal town as late asthe reign of Severus; but considerable doubts havebeen raised of its authenticity. (Komanelli, vol. ii.p. 481; Mommsen, Topogrufia degli Irpini, pp.4,5: in BulL dtJT I tut. Arch. 184S.) The coins,with an Oscan legend, which have been generallyattributed to Murgantia, in reality belong to Teatc.(Friedhuider, Otkuche Mirnzen, p. 49.) 2. A city of Sicily, the name of which is variouslywritten Murgantia, Murgentia, and Morgantia. [Mor­gan™.] [E. H.

MURIAXE (Moi/pioKjj), one of the four districtsof C&taonia in Cappadocia, on the west of Laviane-sane, and south-west of Melitene. It is mentionedonly by Ptolemy (v. 7. § 8), and must not be con­founded with Morimene. [L. S.] MURIUS (J/uAr), a tributary of the Brave(Dravus), which is mentioned only in the Pcuting.Table, though the antiquity of the name is un­doubted, and attested by the station " in Murio," whichwas situated on the road leading from AugustaVindelicornm through Noricum. (Muchar, Aori-amm. I p. 280.) [L. S.] MUROCINCTA, an imperial villa in Pannonia,where Valentinian II. was residing with his motherJostina, when he was proclaimed emperor. (Amm.Marc. xxx. 10.) MCRSA or MU'RSIA (MoG/wro, Kovptria), alsocmlled Mursa Major, to distinguish it from Mursella(Mersella) or Mursa Minor, was an important Romancolony, founded by Hadrian in Lower Pannonia, andbad the surname Aelia. It was the residence ofthe governor of the country, on the Dravus, and therethe roads met leading from Aquincum, Celeia, andPoetovio. In its neighbourhood, Gallienus gained avictory over Ingebus; and Constantine the Greatmade the town the seat of a bishop, A.D. 338. Itsmodern name is Eaek, the capital of Slavonia.(PtoL ii. 16. § 8, viii. 7. § 6 ; Aurel. Vict, de Caet.33 ; Zoaim. ii. 43; Stepb. B. $. v. Movpaa; Geogr.Bav. iv. 19; It. AM. pp. 243, 265, 267, 331; It.Bierot. p. 562 ; Orelli, Inscript. Nos. 3066,3281.) The Lesser Mursa (Mursa Minor or Mursella)was likewise situated in Lower Pannonia, ten milesto the west of Mursa Major, on the road from thislatter place to Poetovio, near the modern village ofPetmtcicz, on the right bank of the Danube, (l'tol.ii. 16. § 7; Geogr.

Mela, ii. 7.§ 13), three islands lying off the E. coast of Crete,the position of which is described by Pliny (iv. 12.8.20): "Circumvectis Criumctopon, trcs MusagorcsappeUatae." In Mr. Pashley's map they are repre­sented by Elaphonesia. (Comp. Hock. Kreta, vol. i.p. 378.) [E. B.J.] MUSARNA (Movadpra, Ptol. vi. 21. § 5, vi. 8.J9; Marcian. Peripl. 29—32,«p.Geogr.Graec. Min.ed. Muller, 1855), a spot on the shore of Gedrosia,as may be inferred from the comparison of the au- thorities. Ptolemy mentions two places of the nameone in Gedrosia, and the other in Caramania; butthere can be no doubt that the same place is in­tended. Arrian speaks of a place which he calls vaMoTapva, on the coast of Gedrosia, which was occu­pied by the Ichthyophagi (Indie. 26). Vincent, whohas examined this geographical question with muchcare, thinks that this port must have been situateda little west of the modern cape Passenee or Pasniee.(Voyage of A'earchus, vol. i. p. 242.) The differ­ence of position in the ancient geographers may beaccounted for by the fact that Musarna must havebeen on the boundary between Gedrosia and Cara­mania. Ptolemy speaks of a tribe, whom he callsMusarnaei (KovtrapvaToi, vi. 21. § 4). There canbe little doubt that they were the people who livedaround Musarna. [V.] MUSO'NES (Amm. Marc. xxix. 5. § 27; Moo-aowoi, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Mussini, Plin. v. 4.8. 4; Musunii, Pevt. Tab.}, a Moorish tribe, whojoined in the revolt of Firmns. (Amm. Marc. I. c.;comp. St. Martin, Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. iii.p. 475.) [E. B. J.] MUSTI (Mouo-t^, Ptol. iv. 3. § 33), a town ofNumidia, which the Antonine Itinerary places at 34M. P. (32 M. P. Pent. Tab.) from Sicca Veneria,92 M. P. from Sufetula, 86 M. P. from Carthage,119 M. P. (by Tipasa) to Cirta; all which distances(considering that the roads are indirect) agree withthe position assigned to it by Shaw (7'rar. p. 179)and llarth (W'andernngen, p. 221) at 'Abd-er-Rabbi, so called from the tomb of a "Marabout.'*According to Vibius Sequester (de Flum. p. 7),it was near the river Bagradas; but Shaw (/. a),who first discovered the site, by the remains of atriumphal arch, and a stone with an inscriptionbearing the ethnic name "Musticensinm,'' speaks ofit as being at some distance from the present courseof the Mejerdah. [E. B. J.] MUSULA'MII (Tac. Ann. ii. 52, iv. 24; Mio-ou-Kauot, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Misulanii, I'eut. Tab.),a Moorish tribe, whom Ptolemy (I. c.) places to theS. of Cirta, at the foot of Audum. Tacitus (/. c.)gives them a more westerly position, and describesthe defeat of this powerful tribe under Tacfarinas,their leader. [E. B. J.] MUTE'NUM, a place in Upper Pannonia, on theroad from Vindobona to Celeia, and probably occu­pying the same site as the modern Muzon. (It.Ant. pp. 233, 266; Cluver, Vitukl. 5.) [L. S.] MUTI1UL, a river of Numidia, which, from itsbeing in the division belonging to Adherbal, must belooked for towards the E. of that country. (Sail.Jug. 48.) [E. B.J.] MU'TIXA (Mnvrlvn, Strab.; Mo-rim, Pol.;Moimpo, Ptol.: Eih. Mutiuensis: Modena), an im­portant city of Gallia Cispadana, situated on the ViaAemilia, between Purina and Bononia. It was35 miles distant from the former, and 25 fromthe latter city. (Strab. v. p. 216; I tin. Ant.p. 127; //in. liter, p. 616.) It appears to luivecertainly existed previous to the conquest of thispart of Italy by the Romans, and was not impro­bably of Etruscan origin. Livy tells us, that thedistrict or territory in which it was situated, wastaken from the Boians, and had previously belongedto the Etruscans (Liv. xxxix. 55); but he doesnot mention the city. Nor do we know at whatperiod the latter fell into the hands of the Romans,though it was probably during the Gaulish War(B.C. 225—222), as we find it in their undisturbed

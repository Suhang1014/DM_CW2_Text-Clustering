OCR Output THE DECLINE AND FALL office of president was exercised by the venerablepraefect of the East, a second Sallust, whose virtuesconciliated the esteem of Greek sophists, and ofChristian bishops. He was assisted by the eloquentMamertinus, one of the consuls elect, whose merit isloudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his ownapplause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrateswas overbalanced by the ferocious violence of fourgenerals, Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus, and Arbetio.Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with lesssurprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposedto possess the secret of the commission: the armedand angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bandsencompassed the tribunal; and the judges werealternately swayed by the laws of justice, and by theclamours of faction. The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abusedthe the favour of Constantius, expiated, by an ignomi­nious death, the insolence, the corruption, andcruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Pauland Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive)were accepted as an inadequate atonement by thewidows and orphans of so many hundred Romans,whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and mur­dered. But Justice herself (if we may use the pa­thetic expression of Ammianus*) appeared to weepover the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire;and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian,whose distress had been seasonably relieved by theintrepid liberality of that honest minister. The rageof the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indis­cretion, was the cause and the excuse of his death;and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own re­proaches and those of the public, offered some con­solation to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution * Ursuli vero nccem ipsa mihi videtur flesse justitia. Libaniuf, who imputeshis death to the soldiers, attempts to criminate the count of the largesses.

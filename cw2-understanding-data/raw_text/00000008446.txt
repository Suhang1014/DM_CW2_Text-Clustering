Anil Attic historians speak of their resi­lience there, and say that un account of their ini­tiatory disposition they were called ittXapyoi (storks)by the Attic people. (Strab. v. p. 221.) This isthe character generally given to the Pelasgi, and itis curious to find Herodotus (i. 56) contrasting thestationary habits of the Pelasgians, with the luve of |wandering exhibited by the Hellenic Dorians. Toreven his own account of the Pelasgi disprove,-; hisgeneral statement; since they could not have existed ^in so many different quarters ns he as&igns to them iwithout several migrations, or—which he nowhereasserts — an almost universal extension over Greeceand its dependencies. It is true that he says (ii. 56)that Hellas was formerly called IVlasgia, and Thu- ,rydides speaks (i. 3) oi the name Hellas being ofcomparatively recent date, and of the Pclasgic namebeing the most prevalent among the tribes of Greece;but this does not account for the Pelasgi being foundin Asia (Horn. //. x. 429), and for their having in­troduced Egyptian rites into Greece. (Herod, ii. 51.)Their sojourn in Attica is related by Herodotus,who says (vi. 137) that they had a portion of groundunder Mt Hymettus assigned them as a reward fortheir services in building the wall of the Acropolisat Athens. From this Hecataeus said they weredriven out by the Athenians from envy, becauseI heir land was the best cultivated. The Athenians,however, says Herodotus, ascribe their expulsion totheir licentious conduct. Thueydides also (ii. 17)mentions the Pelusgic settlement beneath the Acro­polis, and the oracle relating to it. In the passages above quoted Herodotus speaksof the Pelasgi as of foreign extraction. In anotherpassage (viii. 44) lie tells us that the Athenianswere formerly Pelasgians, and were so called, withthe surname of Cranai. They were called suc­cessively Cecrupidae, Erechtheidae ami lones. Strabo (xiii. p. 621) mentions a legend that theinhabitants of Mt. Phricion near Thermopylae madea descent upoll the place where Cyme afterwardsstood, and found it in the possession of Pelasgians,who had suffered from the Trojan War, but werenevertheless in jossession of Larissa, which was about70 stades from Cyme. We find traces of the Pelasgi in several parts ofthe Peloponnese. Herodotus (i. 146) speaks of Ar­cadian Pelasgians, and (vii. 94) tells us that theIonians in Achaca were formerly called PelasgianAerialeaus (or Pelasgians of tlie coast). AlterI lanaus and Xuthus came to Peloponnesus, theywere tailed Ionians, from Inn, son of Xuthus. In the passage of Aeschylus before referred to(Sufi/if. 250) Argos is called Pelasgian; the king ofArgus is also called ava$ n*\a(rjwi> (v. 327), andthroughout the play the words Argive and Pe!a>gianare used indiscriminately. So, too, in tlie Prome­theus Vine I us (v. 860), Argolis is called "the Pe­lasgian laud." In a fragment of Sophocles (Inachim)the king is addressed as lord of Argos and of theTyrrheni Pelasgi. Strabo (vii. p. 321) speaks of Pelasgians takingpossession of part of the Peloponnese, along withother barbarous tribes, and (v. p. 221) says thatEphorus, on Hesiod's authority, traces the origin ofthe Pelasui to Lyeaon, son of Pelasgus, and that liedeclares his own opinion to be that they were ori­ginally Arcadians, who chose a military lite, and, byinducing many others to join them, spread the namef ir and wide, both among the Greeks and wherever they happened to come. 4i The Arcadian div.w <rheroic (icdigree," says Mr. Grote (IluL Crete*,i Uch. ix.), *' begins with Pelasgus, whom botii K&;"iand Asms considered ;is an indigenous nan. tit*.-Arcesihms the Argeian represented him a* kntMof Argos and son of Zeus by Niobe, daurhrn' <tPhoronens; this logogrnpher wished to esu^i icommunity of origin between the Argeians *a»l tmArcadians."

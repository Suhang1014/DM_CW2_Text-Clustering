Thus, the senate being as­sembled in the curia to hear the ambassadors ofthose made prisoners at the battle of Cannae, thepeople are represented as filling the cornitium:"Ubi is tinem fecit, extemplo ab ea turba. quae incomitio erat, clamor flebilis est sublatus, manusquead curiam tendentes, &c." (Id. xxii. 60.) Beingthe place for the contiones it of course had a sug-gestum, or rostra, from which speeches were de­livered; but we shall have occasion to describe thisand other objects on and around the cornitium andforum when we arrive at them in their chronologicalorder. It was not till after the preceding account of thecornitium had been committed to paper that thewriter of it met with the essay on the cornitium byMommsen in the Annali deW /H,*f/j7ufo(vol. xvi.), towhich reference lias before been made. The writerwas glad to perceive that his general view of thesituation of the cornitium had been antiei^tcd,although he is unable to concur with Mommsenrespecting some of the details; such as the situationof the Curia Hostilia, of the temple of Janus, of theForum Caesarls, and some other objects. In re­futing Becker's views, Mommsen has used much thesame arguments, though not in such detail, as thosejust adduced; but he has likewise thought it worthwhile to refute an argument from a passage inHerodian incidentally adduced by Becker in a note(p. 332). As some persons, however, may be dis­posed to attribute more weight to that argumentthan we Jo ourselves, we shall here quote Momm-sen's refutation: "Minus etiam probat alterum,quod a lieckero, p. 332, n. 612, affertur, argumentumdesumtum ex narratione Herodianl, i. 9, Severutnin somnio vidisse Perlinacem equo vectum 8ia fxtarjsttjj iv 'PwfLTj Upas o5oD; qui cum venisset Karattjc apX'V ayopas, tvQa «tt1 ^rifioKparlas ttpo-rtpov hrftxos awiwv jKK\-qo'ia.£tv, equuin eo excussosubiisse Severo eumquc vexisse iirl ttjs byopasfxcvqs.

So much for the negative side of the question:on the positive side Mommsen adduces (p. 299) anargument which had not occurred to the writer ofthe present article in proof of the position aboveindicated for the cornitium. It is drawn from theSacrum Cluacinae. That shrine. Mommsen argues,stood by the Tabernae Novae, that is, near the arch ofSeverus, as Becker has correctly shown {/landb.p. 321) from Livy iii. 48; but lie has done wrongin rejecting the result that may be drawn from thecomparison of the two legends; first, that thecomitium was so called because Romulus andTatius met upon it after the battle (p. 273);second, that the Romans and Sabines cleansed them­selves, after laying aside their arms, at the spotwhere the statue of Venus Cluacina afterwards stood(IMiit. xv. 18. s. 36); whence it follows that thestatue was on the cornitium. A fresh confirmation,Mommsen continues, may be added to this discovery of the truth. For that the Tab?rr* *ere cr t^acomitium, and not on the forum, t& jjerkr ay-poses, is pretty clearly shown by Dionysss (t*Tf ayopav if p SiKafowri «ai tMAipTiafwffi, <drets &AAaj jirtTfXovffi ToKtrucas irpa^ta,iK6<TfiT)<T(v^ ipyaaniploti rt xai tm &**ik6<t(x(m ■trtpt\a€tt>vf iii. 67).

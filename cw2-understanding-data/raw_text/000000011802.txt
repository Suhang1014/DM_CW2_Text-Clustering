Still more important than these individual accessions wasthe gain of the district of Picenum, which was substantiallydue to the son of Strabo, the young Gnaeus Pompeius.The latter, like his father originally no adherent of theoligarchy, had acknowledged the revolutionary governmentand even taken service in Cinna's army; but in his casethe fact was not forgotten, that his father had borne armsagainst the revolution; he found himself assailed in variousforms and even threatened with the loss of his very con足siderable wealth by an indictment charging him to give upthe booty which was, or was alleged to have been, embezzledby his father after the capture of Asculum. The protectionin particular of the consul Carbo who was personally attachedto him, along with the eloquence of the consular LuciusPhilippus and of the young Lucius Hortensius,' avertedfrom him financial ruin; but he remained uneasy. On thenews of Sulla's landing he went to Picenum, where he hadextensive possessions and the best municipal connectionsderived from his father and the Social war, and set up thestandard of the Optimate party in Auximum (Osimo). Thedistrict, which was mostly inhabited by old burgesses, joinedhim; the young men, many of whom had served with himunder his father, readily ranged themselves under the cou足rageous leader who, not yet twenty-three years of age, wasas much soldier as general, sprang to the front of his cavalryin combat, and vigorously assailed the enemy along with them.The corps of Picenian volunteers soon grew to three legions;divisions under Cloelius, Gaius Albius Carrinas, LuciusJunius Brutus Damasippus,* were despatched from thecapital to put down the Picenian insurrection, but the ex足temporized general, dexterously taking advantage of the dis足sensions that arose among them, had the skill to evade themor to beat them in detail and to effect his junction with themain army of Sulla, apparently in Apulia. Sulla salutedhim as imperator, that is, as an officer commanding in hisown name and holding not a subordinate but a parallelposition, and distinguished the youth by marks of honour * We can only suppose this to be the Brutus referred to, since Marcn>88. Brutus the lather of the so-called Liberator was tribune of the people in 671,and therefore could not command in the field.

A youth, saysVelleius Paterculus, of as many virtues asprudence can acquire, or human naturecan admit. The fine ode of Horace, Qua-km Ministrum fulminis alitem, book iv.ode 4, written in the year of Rome 743,displays his military character in thebrightest colours. He rose to the highestcivil offices, such as praetor, aedile, andconsul. He commanded the Roman armyin Germany, and for his victories obtainedthe name of Germanicus. He was fa-.ther of the famous Germanicus by An-tonia the younger (see No. 42). He diedA. U. 745; the pride of the Claudian fa­mily, and the favourite of the Romanpeople. Augustus spoke his funeral pane­gyric, and in his speech offered up a fer­vent prayer to the gods, that all futureCaesars might resemble him, and that hisown death, whenever it should happen,might be equally honourable and as sin­cerely lamented.—Suet.

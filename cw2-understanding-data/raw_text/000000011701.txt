VI.] AND THE ATTEMPT OF DRUSUS AT REFORM. 219 government when measures against the democrats were inquestion, it sternly resented every attempt to restrict it inthis its well-acquired right of unlimited sway in the pro­vinces. Several such attempts were now made; the governingaristocracy began again to feel its strength, and its very bestmen reckoned themselves bound, at least for their own part,to oppose the dreadful maladministration in the provinces.The most resolute in this respect was Quintus MuciusScawola, like his father Publius pontifex maximus and in659 consul, the foremost jurist and one of the most excellent 95.men of his time. As praetorian governor (about 656) of 98.Asia, the richest and worst abused of all the provinces, he—in concert with his older friend, distinguished as an officer,jurist, and historian, the consular Publius Rutilius Rufus—set a severe and deterring example. Without making anydistinction between Italians and provincials, noble andignoble, he took up every complaint, and not only compelledthe Roman merchants and state-lessees to give full pecuniarycompensation for proven injuries, but, when some of theirmost important and most unscrupulous agents were foundguilty of crimes deserving death, deaf to all offers of briberyhe ordered them to be duly crucified.

The charge, that such a man had allowedhimself to perpetrate exactions in Asia, almost broke downtinder its own absurdity and under the infamy of theaccuser, one Apicius; yet the welcome opportunity ofhumbling the consular was not allowed to pass, and, whenthe latter, disdaining false rhetoric, mourning robes, andtears, defended himself briefly, simply, and to the point,and proudly refused the homage which the sovereign capi­talists desired, he was actually condemned, and his mode­rate property was confiscated to satisfy fictitious claims forcompensation. The condemned resorted to the provincewhich he was alleged to have plundered, and there, wel­comed by all the communities with honorary deputations, and

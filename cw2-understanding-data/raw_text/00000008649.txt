Of Segusio as a municipal town we hearlittle; but it is mentioned as such both by Pliny andPtolemy, and its continued existence is proved byinscriptions as well as the Itineraries; and we learnthat it continued to be a considerable town, anda military post of importance, as commanding thepasses of the Alps, until long after the fall of theWestern Empire. (Plin. iii. 17. s. 21; Ptol. hi- 1.§ 40; Grnter, Inscr. p. 111. 1; Orell. Imcr. 1690,3803; Amm. Mare. xv. 10; Itin. Hier. p. 556;P. Diac. Hist. Lang. iii. 8; Ore?. Tur. iv. 39.) AmmUnus tells us that the tomb of Cottiua wasstill visible at Segusio in his time, and was the objectof much honour and veneration among the inhabitants(Amm. /. c). A triumphal arch erected by him inhonour of Augustus is still extant at Stisa; it enu­merates the names of the "Civitates " which weresubject to his rule, and which were fourteen in num­ber, lhough Pliny si>eaks of the " Cottianae civitatesxii." (Plin. iii. 20. t>. 24; Orell. /;wcv. 626.) Allthese are, however, mere obscure mountain tribes,and the names of most of them entirely unknown.His dominions extended, according to Strabo, acrossthe mountains as far as Ebrodunum in the land ofthe Caturiges (Strab. iv. p. 179); and this is con­firmed by the inscription which enumerates the Ca­turiges and Medulli among the tribes subject to hisauthority. Tiieje are probably the two omitted byPliny. CK'elum, in the valley of the Chisone, wascomprised in the territory of Cottius, while its limittowards the Taurini was marked by the station AdFines, placed by the Itineraries on the road to Au­gusta Taurinorum. But the distances given in tlieItineraries are incorrect, and at variance with oneanother. Ad Fines may probably be placed at or nearAriy/iarui, 15 miles from Turin, and 20 from Susa.The mountain tribes called by Pliny the "Cottianaecivitates,'* when united with 1 lie Human government,at first received only the Latin franchise (Plin. /. c);hut as Segusio became a Roman municipium, it musthave received the full franchise. [E. II. B.] SEGUSTEKO, a name which occurs in the Anto-nine Itin. and in the Table, is a town of Gallia Nar-bonensis. any! the name is preserved in Sisteron, thechief town of an arrondtssement in the department ofBasse* Alp*:*, on the right hank of the Durance.Roman remains have been found at Sisteron. Thename in the Notit. Prov. Galliae is Civitas Segeste-riorum. It was afterwards called Segesteriuui, andSistericum, whence the modern name comes. (U'An-ville, Xotice.tfc.) [G. L.] SEIR, M. (Srjtlp, EXX. 2tt€ipa,Joseph). "The land of Seir" is equivalent to " thecountry of Edom." ((/eft. XXX.il. 3.) Mount Seir wasthe dwelling of Esau and his posterity (xxxvi. 8, 9;Deut.W. 4,5), in the possession of which they were notto he disturbed. {Josh. xxiv. 4.) Its general situ­ation is defined in Deuteronomy (i. 2) betweenHoreb and Kadesh Barnea. The district must havebeen extensive, for in their retrograde movementfrom Kadesh, which was in Seir (i. 44), the Israel-iles compassed Mount Seir many days (ii. 1. 3). Theoriginal inhabitants of Mount Seir were the Horims;''but the children of Esau succeeded them, whenthey had destroyed them from before them, anddwelt in their stead" (ii. 12, 22; com p. Gen.xiv. 6). It obviously derived its name from " Seirthe Horite" (xxxvi. 20, 21). and not, as Jasephuserroneously supposes, from the Hebrew "VJJC' = hir-sulus. {Ant. i. 20. § 3.)

After the lofs fuftained in thelaft battle, the Veientians avoided coming again toB.C.474. an engagement. They employed themfelves incommitting depredations, and fending out partiesfrom the Janiculum, which ferved them as a for-trefs; fcoured every part of the Roman territories,fo that neither the cattle, nor the hufbandmen, couldany where remain in fafety.

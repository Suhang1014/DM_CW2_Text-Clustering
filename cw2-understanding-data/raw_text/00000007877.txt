In B. c. 208 I'hilip, son of Demetrius, de-'feated the Aetolians near Lamia. (Liv. xwii. 30.)In 192 Lamia opened its Rates to Antiochus (Liv. .xxxv. 43), and was in consequence besieged in thefollowing year by I'hilip, who was then acting in |conjunction with the Romans. (Liv. xxxvi. 25.) Onthis occasion Livy mentions the difficulty which theMacedonians experienced in mining the rock, whichwas siliceous (" in asperis locis silcx saepe impene-trabilis ferrooccurrebat"). In 190 the town was takenby the Romans. (Liv. xxxvii. 4, 5.) Lamia is men- itioned by Pliny (iv. 7. s. 14), and was also inexistence in the sixth century. (Hierocl. p. 642, ed.Wesseling.) The site of Lamia is fixed at Zittmi,both by the description of the ancient writers of theposition of Lamia, and by an inscription which PaulLncas copied at this place. Zittmi is situated on ahill, and is by nature a strongly fortified position.The only remains of the ancient city which Leakediscovered were some pieces of the walls of theAcropolis, forming a part of those of the moderncastle, and some small remains of the town walls atthe foot of the hill, beyond the extreme modernhouses to the eastward. On the oppmitc side of thetown Leake noticed a small river, which, we learnfrom Strabo (ix. p. 434. 450), was called Achelous.The port of Malia was named Phai.ara (t& 4-o>Aopa, Strab. ix. p. 435; Polyb. xx. 11; Liv. xxvii.30, xxxv. 43; Plin. iv. 7. s. 12), now StijUdha.Zittmi has been compared to Athens, with its oldcastle, or acropolis, above, and its Peiraecus at Sttj-Utlha, on the shore below. Thin- is a tine view fromthe castle, commanding the whole country adjacentto the head of the Maliac gulf.

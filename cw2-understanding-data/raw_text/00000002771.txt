ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 417 under ground, and these convicted the king's chief hunter,that he had given the young men the royal hunting spears, andweapons to Alexander's dependents, at Alexander's command. 4>. After these, the commander of the garrison of Alexandriumwas caught and tortured; for he was accused to have promisedto receive the young men into his fortress, and to supply themwith that money of the king's which was laid up in that fortress,yet did he not acknowledge any thing of it himself; but his soncame in, and said it was so, and delivered up the writing, which,so far as could be guessed, was in Alexander's hand. Its con­tents were these: " When we have finished, by God's help, all"that we have proposed to do, we will come to you; but do"your endeavours, as you have promised, to receive us into"your fortress." After this writing was produced, Herod hadno doubt about the treacherous designs of his sons against him.But Alexander said, that Diophantus the scribe, had imitatedhis hand, and that the paper was maliciously drawn up byAntipater; for Diophantus appeared to be very cunning in suchpractices, and as he was afterward convicted of forging otherpapers, he was put to death for it.

But sheimmediately carried those words to her brother; upon this he wasout of patience, and gave command to bind him; and enjoinedthem both, now they were kept separate one from the other, towrite down the ill things they had done against their father, andbring the writings to him. So when this was enjoined them,they wrote this, that they had laid no treacherous designs, noimade any preparations against their father, but that they hadintended to fly away; and that by the distress they were in,their lives being now uncertain and tedious to them.

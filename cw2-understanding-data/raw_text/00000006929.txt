OCR Output STYLE OF TACITD8. 25 opinions; touching his learning, his fidelity, and his skill as an histo足rian. But now, since I have no other purpose than to write a prefaceto my edition, I have briefly discussed some subjects and have passedDy others, particularly those which it is evidently better to omit, thanto treat briefly and therefore unsatisfactorily. And it is better thatthose who start such questions should consult those books, (and theyare not a few), in which the ideas of men of pre-eminent talent havebeen ably and fully unfolded. But concerning the style of our au足thor I have treated a little more extensively, in order to compensatefor the small number and briefness of my notes; and, at the sametime, if I should seem to have used too great boldness in either ex足pressing an opinion or making a correction, to defend my position bybringing together under a single view the scattered examples. Forthis I have chiefly labored, and not with the more ambitious aim toset forth a sort of image and picture of the style of Tacitus. Who足ever shall undertake this, will find not a few who will repeat to himihese lines of Goethe: Nosoituro, descripturo, quod animo et vita viget, Hoc tibi providendum est, animum et vitara ut evites prills; Proinde partes exanimatas fecili tractabis munu.

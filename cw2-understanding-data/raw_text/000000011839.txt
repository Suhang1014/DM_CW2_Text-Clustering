The objection of thepious believer, that the god of the Stoic had neither sexnor age nor corporeality and was converted from a personinto an idea, had a meaning in Greece, but not in Rome.The coarse allegorizing and moral purification, which werecharacteristic of the Stoical doctrine as to the gods, destroyedthe very marrow of the Hellenic mythology; but the plasticpower of the Romans, scanty even in their epoch ofsimplicity, had produced no more than a light veil enve­loping the original intuition or the original notion out ofwhich the divinity had arisen—a veil that might be strippedoff" without special damage. Pallas Athene might be indig­nant, when she found herself suddenly transmuted into theidea of memory: Minerva had hitherto been in reality notmuch more. The supernatural Stoic, and the allegoricRoman, theology coincided on the whole in their result.But, even if-the philosopher was obliged to designate indi­vidual propositions of the priestly lore as doubtful or aserroneous—as when the Stoics, for example, rejecting thedoctrine of apotheosis, saw in Hercules, Castor, and Polluxnothing but the spirits of distinguished men, or as whenthey could not allow the images of the gods to be regardedas representations of divinity—it was at least not the habitof the adherents of Zeno to make war on these erroneousdoctrines and to overthrow false gods; on the contrary,they everywhere evinced respect and reverence for thereligion of the land even in its weaknesses. The inclinationalso of the Stoa towards a casuistic morality and towards asystematic treatment of the professional sciences was quiteto the mind of the Romans, especially of the Romans of thisperiod, who no longer like their fathers practised in unso­phisticated fashion self-government and good morals, but re­solved the simple moralitv of their ancestors into a catechism

Indeed Eu-menius cxpre-sly says that Fulviua Nobilior whenin Greece had heard "Herculem Musagetem essecomitein ducemque Musarum" (pro Inst. Schol.Avg. p. 195, Amtz.); and we learn from Ovid thatthe statue of Hercules represented him with alyre (Fast. vi. 810) : — "Annuit Alcidcs, increpuitque lyram." The vicinity of the temple and portico is indicatedin Martial (v. 49. 8). It is supposed that the Theatrum Baldi layclose to the western side of this portico, and, a littlefarther on, opposite the round end oi* the circus, butrather to the north of it, the Theatrum Pompeii;of which latter there are still some remains at thePalazzo Pio. Pompey's theatre must have lainclose to the boundary between the Campus Martinsand Circus Flaminius since Pliny mentions that acolossal statue of Jupiter, erected by the emperorClaudius in the Campus, was called Pompeianusfrom its vicinity to the theatre (*'Talis in CampoMartiu Jupiter a Divo Claudio Caesare dicatus, quivocatur Pompeianus a viemitate theatri," xxxiv.18). The same tiling might also be inferred fromCicero ('' Quid enim loci natura afferre potest, ut inporticu Pompeii potiusquam in Campo ambulemus,"de Fato, 4.) Hence it would appear that theboundary of the two districts, after proceedingalong the northern side of the Circus Flaminius,took a north-westerly direction towards the river.The Poirncrs Pompeii adjoined the scena of histheatre, and afforded a shelter to the spectators inthe event of bad weather. (Vitruv. v. 9.) Butwhat conferred the greatest interest on this group ofbuildings was the Curia Pompeii, a large hall orhexedra in the portico itself, sometimes used for therepresentation of plays as well as for assemblies ofthe senate. It was here that Caesar was assas­sinated, at the base of Pompey's statue; an eventwhich caused it to be regarded as a locus sceleratus,ami to he walled up in consequence. (Cic. Div. ii.9; Dion Cass. xliv. 16. 52: Suet. Cues. 80,88;Pint. Brut. 14, Cats. 66, &c.) The statue ofPompey, however, was first taken out by order ofAugustus, and placed under a marble arch orJanus, opposite the portico. (Suet. Awj. 31.) Itis a question whether the portico styled Hecato-stylon, from its having a hundred columns, wasonly another name for the portico of Pompey, orquite a distinct building. It is sometimes men­tioned in a manner which would seem to intimatethat it was identical with the Porticus Pompeii.Tims both ate said to have had groves of plane-trees (Prop. ii. 32. 11), and to have been consumedin one and the same fire. (Hieron. Chron. p. 475,Hone.) The following lines of Martial, however,appear to show that they were separate, but adjoin­ing buildings (ii. 14. 6); — "Indc petit centum pendentia tccta columnis;Illinc Pompeii dona neinusque duplex" From these lines, and from two fragments of theI'apitoline Plan, Canina has correctly inferred thatthere were two distinct porticoes, and that theHeeatostylon adjoined the X. side of that of Pompey.(Indie, p. 373.) Pompey also built a private dwell­ing-house near his theatre, in addition to the housewhich he possessed in the Carinae. The former ofthese seems to have been situated in some gardens. | (Plut.

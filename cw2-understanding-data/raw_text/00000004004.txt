VI. seem to one another to be enemies: for every one of themreceived those of their own men that came back in the darkas Romans, and made an assault upon them ; so that moroof them were wounded by their own men than by the enemy,till, upon the coming on of the day, the nature of the fightwas discerned by the eye afterward. Then did they standin battle-array in distinct bodies, and cast their darts regularly,and regularly defended themselves. Nor did either side yieldor grow weary. The Romans contended with each other whoshould fight the most strenuously, both single men and entireregiments, as being under the eye of Titus: and every oneconcluded that this day would begin his promotion, if hefought bravely. What were the great encouragements of theJews to act vigorously, were their fear for themselves andfor the temple, and the presence of their tyrant, who exhortedsome, and beat and threatened others, to act courageously.Now, it so happened that this fight was for the most part astationary one, wherein the soldiers went on and came backin a short time and suddenly: for there was no long spaceof ground for either of their flights or pursuits. But stillthere was a tumultuous noise among the Romans from thetower of Antonia, who loudly cried out upon all occasions totheir own men to press on courageously, when they were toohard for the Jews, and to stay, when they were retiring back­ward ; so that here was a kind of theatre of war; for whatwas done in this fight could not bo concealed either fromTitus or from those that were about him. At length it ap­peared that this fight, which began at the ninth hour of thenight, was not over till past the fifth hour of the day, andthat in the same place where the battle began neither partycould say they had made the other to retire; but both thearmies left the victory almost in uncertainty between them ;wherein those that signalized themselves on the Roman sidewere a great many, but on the Jewish side, and of those thatwere with Simon, Judas the son of Merto, and Simon the sonof Josias ; of the Idumeans, James and Simon, the latter ofwhom was the son of Cathlas, and James was the son ofSosas; of those that were with John, Gyptheus and Alexas,and of the zealots Simon the son of Jairus.

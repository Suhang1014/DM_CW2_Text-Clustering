On a hill which commands Vesunna,and is separated from it by the river file, there arethe remains of a Roman camp, which is called Campdc Cesar, though Caesar never was there; butsome of his successors may have been. There areseveral other Roman camps about Perhjimtx. Se­veral Human roads have been traced leading to Peri-gueux.

L.] VESUVIUlS MONS (Ovetrovios, or OvcvovGios:Mrmte Vesuvi6)y sometimes also called by Latinwriters Vesevts, and Vf.svius or Vesbits (Be'cr-6toy, Dion Cass.), a celebrated volcanic mountain ofCampania, situated on the shore of the gulf calledthe Crater or Bay of Kaples, from which it risesdirectly in an isolated conical mass, separated on allsides from the ranges of the Apennines by a broadtract of intervening plain. It rises to the height of4020 feet, and its ba.se is nearly 30 miles in cir­cumference. Though now celebrated for the frequency as wellas violence of its eruptions, Vesuvius had in ancienttimes been so long in a quiescent state that all tra­dition of its having ever been an active volcano waslost, and until after the Christian era it was notedchiefly for the great fertility of the tract that ex­tended around its base and up its sloping sides(Virg. Georg. ii. 227; Strab v. p. 247), a fertilitywhich was in great measure owing to the deposits offine volcanic sand and ashes that had been thrownout from the mountain. There were not indeedwanting appearances that proved to the accurateobserver the volcanic origin and nature of Vesuvius:hence IHodorus speaks of it as " bearing many signsof its having been a burning mountain in timed longpast " (Diod. iv. 21); but though he considers it ashaving on this account given name to the Phlegraeanplains, he does not allude to any historical or tra­ditional evidence of Its former activity. Straboin like manner describes it as "surrounded byfields of the greatest fertility, with the exceptionof the summit, which was for the most partlevel, and wholly barren, covered with allies, andcontaining clefts and hollows, formed among rocksof a burnt aspect, as if they had been eaten away byfire; so that a person would be led to the conclusionthat the spot had formerly been in a state of con­flagration, and had craters from which fire had burstforth, but that these had been extinguished for wantof fuel" (v. p. 247). He adds that the great fer­tility of the neighbourhood was very probably owingto this cause, as that of Catana was produced byMount Aetna. In consequence of this fertility, aswell as of the beauty of the adjoining bay, the line ofcoast at the foot of Vesuvius was occupied by severalflourishing towns, and by numbers of villas belong­ing to wealthy Roman nobles. The name* of Vesuvius is twice mentioned in his­tory before the Christian era. In u. c. 340 it wasat the foot of this mountain that was fought thegreat battle between the Romans and the Latins, inwhich P. Decius devoted himself to death for hiscountry. (Liv. viii. 8.) The precise scene of theaction is indeed uncertain, though it was probablyiu the plain on the N. hide. Livy describes it as"baud procul radieibus Vesuvii mentis, qua via adVeserim ferebat;" but the situation of the Veseris is ■wholly uncertain.

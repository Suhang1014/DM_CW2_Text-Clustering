They were, almost certainly, a Scythiantribe of Kherson, who during the period of theGreek settlements harassed Olbia, and, during thellyxantine period, joined with the other barbariansof the Lower Danube agitata Rome. Of these,the chief confederates were the Heruli and Turci-lingi; with wliom they found their way as far westas Bavaria.

(See Zeuss, s. c. Sciri). The Sciri of the later writers were probably aportion of the Scythians of the parts between theDanube and J>on, under a newer and more spe­cific name.

The name probably expressedthe wild and rugged nature of the country, for theword signified hard and rugged {oKipov, <rnupov,oKkwpov, Hesych.), It was bounded by the Mae-Daliana on the north, and by the Parrhasians on thewest, and was originally part of Arcadia, but wasconquered at an early period, and its inhabitantsreduced to the condition of Lacedaemonian Perioeci.(Steph. B. s. v. 2k£?os; Thuc. v. 33.)

(Thuc.v. 67, 68.) They were frequently placed in thepost of danger, and sometimes remained with theking as a body of reserve. (Xen. Cyr. it, 2. § 1,HeU. v. 2. § 24, v. 4. § 52; Diod. xv. 32.)

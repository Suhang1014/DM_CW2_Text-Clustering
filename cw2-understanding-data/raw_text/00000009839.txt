OCR Output PREFACE. IT was not from a private choice, but from deference towhat was judged a public call, that the following translationof Thucydides was first undertaken. To explain the motivemore largely, might perhaps incur the imputation of imperti­nence or vanity. The performance, upon the whole, mustjustify the undertaking. In what manner it is done, and notwhy it was done, will be the point of public arbitration. It will be also needless to tell the English Reader, howmany versions have been made of Thucydides into Latin.Their design was to bring the author more under the obser­vation of what is generally styled the learned world ; as thetranslations of him into modern languages have aimed at in­troducing him into general acquaintance, as a historian ca­pable of innocently amusing most ranks of men, but of use­fully instructing the persons, who from duty and frompassion would guard the rights or secure the welfare of pub­lic communities. The grand business of History is to makemen wiser in themselves and better members of society. Forthis purpose it recals past ages to their view; and thus opensa more extensive scope to reflection than any personal expe­rience can offer. To be well versed in a similarity of casesprepares men better for counsel or action on present contin­gencies. The statesman, the patriot, the friend to liberty andreason will be better enabled to plan and to regulate his ownmeasures, when he can see the tendency and consequence ofsuch as were followed on parallel occasions, and adjust thedegrees, in which they were either prejudicial or serviceableto public good.

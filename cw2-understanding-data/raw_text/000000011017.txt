ROMAN HISTORY, 351 centre, they would have paid dear for their rebellion,if Vectius Messius, one of the Volsci, a man more dis­tinguished for his merit, than his birth, had not read hiscountrymen a severe lecture, as they were already star­ing about them in crowds; calling aloud to them, 'Areyou determined to open your breasts, exposed to theenemy's darts, and to fall here unrevenged? Was itfor this purpose that you brought arms with you?—Was this all you had in view, when you were the firstto take up arms; mighty bold, when there is no dan­ger, but in battle mere poltroons? What do you lookfor standing here? Do you imagine, that some divi­nity is to take you under his protection, and extricateyou from your present difficulty? No; you must opena passage with your swords. Such of you as haveany desire to see your houses, fathers, wives, andchildren again, come this way along with me, whitheryou shall see me lead the way. You are neither ob­structed by walls nor entrenchments; but by menarmed like yourselves. If you are equal in courseyou are certainly superior in point of necessity, thelast and most effectual weapon.'He had scarce finished this speech, when he was fol­lowed by his own people with repeated shouts, as he wasputting in practice what he had promised. They at­tacked with great fury the cohorts -which opposed themunder Posthnmius Albus, and made them give way,victorious as they had been, till the dictator came upjust as they were beginning to retire. The whole heatof the battle turned that way. The fate of the enemydepended on Messius alone. The list of the woundedand killed was high on both sides. On the side of theRomans, the general officers did not escape withoutwounds. Though the dictator was wounded in theshoulder, though Fabius' thigh was almost pinned to hishorse, and though the consul lost an arm, none of themthought of quitting the field at so critical a juncture.

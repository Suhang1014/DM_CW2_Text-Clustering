The old city— awamj bj Phxlia, after the capture of Am- phipolU, Pydna, and Potidaea, and fortified to pro­tect his frontier against the Thracian monntainecn'.On the plain of Philippi, between Haemus andPangaeuH, the last battle was lotit by the republicHnsof Rome. Appian (I. c.) has given a clear descrip­tion of Philippi, and the posiiion on which Cassiusaud Brutus encamped. The town was situated ona steep hill, bordered to the N. by the foreststhrough which the Caspian army advanced,— to theS. by a marsh, beyond which was the sea, to theE. by the passes of the Sapaei and Corpili, and tothe W. by the great plains of Myrcinu?, Drahescun,and the Strymon, which were S50 utadia in length.Not far from Philippi, was the hill of Dkhivmis,containing the gold mines called A*yla; and 18stadia from the town, were two other heights, 8stadia asunder; on the one to the N. Brutuspitched his camp, and Cassius on that to the S.Brutus was protected on his right by rorky hills,and the left of Cassias by a mar>h. The riverGangas or Gangites flowed along the front, and theBea was in the rear. The camps of the two leaders,although separate, were enclosed within a commonentrenchment, and midway between them was thepass, which led like a gate from Europe to Asia.The galleys were at Neapolis. 70 stadia distant, andthe commissariat in Thasos, distant 100 stadia.Dion Cassius (xlvii. 35) adds, that Philippi wasnear Pangaeus and Symbolum, and that Symbolum,which was between Philippi and Neapolis, was socalled because it connected Pangaeus with anothermountain stretching inland; which indentities itwith the ridge which stretches from Prdvista toKavdla, separating the bay of Kavdla from theplain of Philippi. The Pylue, therefore, could be noother than the pass over that mountain behindKavdla. M. Antonius took up his position on theright, opposite to that of Cassius, at a distance of 8stadia from theenemy. Octavius Caesar was opposedto Brutus on the "left hand of the even field."Here, in the autumn of u. c. 42, in the first engage­ment, Brutus was successful against Octavius,while Antonius had the advantage over Ca^ius.Brutus, incompetent to maintain the discipline ofhis troops, was forced to fight again; and in anengagement which took place on the same ground,twenty days afterwards, the KepnMic perished.Regarding the battle a curious mistake was re­peated by the Roman writers (Manil. i. 908; Ovid,Met xv. 824; Flor. iv. 42; Lucan, i. 680, vii.854, ix. 271; Jnv. viii. 242), who represented it asfought on the same ground as Pharsalia.—a mistakewhich may have arisen from the ambignity in thelines of Virgil (Georg. i. 490), and favoured by thefact of the double engagement at Philippi. (Meri-vale, Hist, of Roman Empire, vol. iii. p. 214.)Augustus afterwards presented it with the privilegesof ** a colonia," with the name" Col. Jul. Aug. Philip."(Orelli, Inter. 512, 3658, 3746, 4064; and oncoins; Rasche, vol. iii. pt 2. p. 1120), and con­ferred upon it the " Jus Italicum." (Dion Cass. li.4.) It was here, in his second missionary journey,that St. Paul, accompanied hy Silas, came into con­tact with the itinerant traders in popular superstitions{Acts, xvi. 12—40); and the city was again visitedby the Apostle on his departure from Greece, {Acts,xx. 6.) The Gospel obtained a home in Knropehere, for the first time; and in the autumn of a. d.62, its great teacher, from his prison, under the waliaof Nero's palace, sent a letter of grateful acknow­ledgment to his Macedonian converts. Philippi was

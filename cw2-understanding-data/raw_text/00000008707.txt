PED1EIS (ntoi<7i)- inhabitants of one ofttie Phocian towns destroyed by Xerxes. (Herod,viii. 33.) From the order in which it stands in tin1enumeration of Herodotus, it appears to have stoodnear the Cephissus, in some part of the plain be­tween Tithorea anil Elateia, and is perhaps re­presented by the ruins at Paled Flea.

Tin.* town formed a small state byitself, hut was always involved in war with theneighbouring Selge. (Polyb. v. 72, &e.) It. isalso mentioned in the ecclesiastical annals and oncoins.

[L. S.] PEDO'NIA (nijoWfo), a town on the coast ofMarmarica, before which lay an island of the samename. (Ptol, iv. 5. 4}$ 32, 75.) This island is alsomentioned by Strabo, but in some editions under thename of Sidonia (xvii. p. 799). We may, however,conclude from Ptoh-niv that lYdi>nia is tiie directreading. (See Groskurd's Strabo, vol iii. p. 357.) I'EIH'M (n<5a, Steph. I*.: Eth. IleoWy, Pe-danus: OalUcano), an ancient city of Latimn, whichnpjKv:rs to have been at one period of considerableimportance. It is mentioned by Dionysus as one ofthe cities which composed the league against Koinein it. c. 493; and there is n<> doubt that it was, infact, one of the thirty cities of the Latin League.(I)imiy.s. v. 01; Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 17.) It is nextmen tinned among the cities which are said to havebeen taken by Coriolanus in tin* campaign of b. r.488, where its name is associated with those ofLahicum and Cnrbio. (Liv. ii. 39; Dionys. viii. 19;PIut. Coriol. 28.) Dionysius terms it at this timea small city (lb. 20); and it is remarkable that itsname does not again <H'cur during the warn of theItomans with the Aequians, notwithstanding itsproximity to the frontier of the two nations. It isnext mentioned in d. c. 358, when the Gauls, whohad invaded Latium, encamped in its neighbour-hood, where they sustained a severe defeat from thedictator C. Sulpiciua. (Liv. vil. 12.) During thelast great struggle of the Latins with Rome, thePedani bear a more considerable part. Their name,indeed, is not mentioned at the first outbreak of thew ar, though there can he no doubt of their havingtaken part in it: but, in n. c. 339, Pedum becamefor a time the centre of hostilities, being besieged bythe Roman consul Aemihus, and defended by theallied forces assembled from Tibur, Praeueste, Veli-trae, Lanuvium, and Antium. Aemilius on thisoccasion abandoned the enterprise; but the next yearCamilitis again advanced to Pedum, and. the forcesof the Latins being now divided, the Tihurtines andPraeuee tines alone arrived fur its protection. They were defeated in a great battle by Camillas, md tbfcity of Pedum taken by assault immeiiUtely ni'r-wards. (Liv. viii. 12,13; Fait.

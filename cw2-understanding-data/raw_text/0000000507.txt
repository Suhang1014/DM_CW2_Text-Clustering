Nor perhaps was itafterwards known, that Hyrcanus had left any behind him;till Herod, prying about every where for money, at lengthmet with that remainder also, and took it all away. Sepul­chres were of old looked upon as places so sacred andinviolable, that treasures might be more safely trusted inthem, than in almost any other places.

From this tribute, however,the Thebans were delivered by Hercules, who madewar upon Orehomenus, and gre.illy reduced itspower. (l'an>.ix. 37. § 2; Strab. ix. p. 414; Diod.iv 18.) In the Homeric catalogue Orehomenus ismentioned along with Aspledon, but distinct fromthe other Bix'otian towns, uiid as sending 30 .shipsto the Trojan War (//. ii. 511). Sixty years afterthe Tro an War, according to the received chronology,the sovereignty of the Minyae seems to have beenoverthrown by the Boeotian immigrants fromThessaly; and Orehomenus became a member of theB"eotian confederacy. (Strab. ix. p. 401; cornp.Time. i. 12.) The city now ceased to !>«• the Minyeianand became the Boeotian Orehomenus (Time. iv. 7*>);hut it still remained a powerful state, and throughoutthe whole historical period was second only to Thebesin the Boeotian confederacy. The town of Chaeroneiaappears to have been always one of its dependencies.(Time. iv. 7(1.) In the Persian War Orehomenus,together with the other Boeotian towns, with theexception of Thespiae and Plataeac, deserted thecause of Grecian independence. Orehomenus pos­sessed an aristocrat ienl government, and continuedon friendly terms with Thebes, as long as the aristo­crat ical party in the latter city had tlie direction ofpublic affairs. But when, after the close of thePeloponnesian War. a revolution placed the govern­ment of Thebes in the hands of the democracy, Or­ehomenus became op[>osed to Thebes. Accordingly,when war broke out between Sparta and Thebes, andLysander invaded Boeotia in it. <_'. 395, Orehomenusrevolted from Thebes, and sent troops to assist Ly-sandcr in Ins siege of Haliartus (Plut. Lys. 28; Xen.Hell iii. 5. § C, seq.; Diod. xiv. 81; Com. N'ej/is.Lys. 3.) In the following year (u. c. 394). when alltlie other Boeotians joined the Tliebans and Atheniansat the battle of Coroneia, tlie Orchomenians foughtin the army of Agesilaus, who arrayed them againstthe Thebans. (Xen. //til. iv. 3. § 15, Ayes. 2. § 9.)It was now the object of the Spartans to depriveThebes of her supremacy over the Boeotian cities.This they effected by the peace of Autalcidas, it.<•.387, by winch Thebes was obliged to acknowledgethe independence of Orehomenus and of the cities ofBoeotia. (Xen. Hell. v. ]. § 31.) The battle ofLenctra (n. c. 371) changed the position of affairs,and made Thebes the undisputed master of Boeotia.Orehomenus was now at the mercy of the Thebans,who were anxious to destroy the city, and reduce theinhabitants to slavery. Kpaininondas, however, dis­suaded them from carrying their wishes into effect,and induced them to pardon Orehomenus, and re­admit it as a member of tin: Boeotian confederation.(I)iod. xv. 57.) The Thebans appear to have yieldedwith reluctance to the generous advice of Epami-noiulas; and they took advantage of his absence inThessaly, in it.<*. 368, to carry their original designinto effect. The pretext was that the 300 knightsat Orehomenus had entered into a conspiracy withsome Theban exiles to overthrow the democraticalconstitution of Thebes. It is not improbable thattlie whole story was a fiction; but tlie Thebans eagerlylistened to the accusation, condemned the 300 Or-chomenians, and decreed that the city should bedestroyed. A Theban army was immediately sentagainst it, which burnt it to the ground, put all themale inhabitants to the sword, ami sold all the womenand children into slavery. (Diod. XV. 79; 1'uus. ix. 15. § 3.) This atrocious act of ren^nce ptm-*4as an indelible stigma upon the TUbaa ciiiTt^a(Dem. c. Leptin. p. 490.)

It appears to have bw-n rmiiduring the Phocian War, when the Pboaua a-dcavoured to expel the Thebans from tbfiwr'.bnparts of Boeotia, In B.C. 353 we find tlie iV-uileader Onomarchus in jtossession of OniioutDi^ adCoroneia (Diod. xvi. 33, 35); and in the Ufe<*o(year I'hayllus was defeated in the netgbbourt^tl 4these towns.

In the interior was a vast lake, ex­tending to the Aitakiatak. A fertile island of180 stadia in circuit was in the lake (Pallida Utovo,or Pvporo). From this lake the river flowed, at adistance of one day's sail from the river Arion('Aoiuu', Scylax, /. c.: Orublit; comp. Pouqucvllle,Voyage dtnis la Gri'ce, vol. i. p. 25.) This riverformed the S. boundary of Dalmatia, and its bankswere occupied by the Daorezi, Ardiaei and, Paraei.(Strab. vii. pp. 315, 317.) These banks wereiiimous in former times among tho professors ofpharmacy, who are advised by Nicander (Theriaca,v. 607) to gather the "Iris" there. (I'lin. xiii. 2,xxi. 19; Theophr. ap. Athen.xv. p. 681.) .Strabo (vii.p. 317) rejects the statement of Theopoinpus thatthe potters' clay of Chios and Thasos was found inthe bed of tho river, r'or the valley of the Narenta,sec Wilkinson, Dalmatia and Montenegro, vol. ii.pp. 1—93. [E. B.J.] NAKO'NA (Napfiivo, a mistake fur Nopwi a, Ptol.ii. 17. § 12, viii. 7. § 8), a town in Dalmatia, and aRoman "colonia." It appears from the letters of P.Vatinius to Cicero (ad Fam. v. 9, 10), dated Narona,that the Romans made it their head-quarters dur­ing their conquest of Dalmatia. (Comp l'omp. Mela,ii. 3. § 13; I tin. Anton.; Pent. Tab.; Geog. Rav.iv. 16.) Narona was a "conventus." at which,according to M. Vatro (ap Plin. iii. 26) 89 citiesassembled; in the time of l'liny (I. c.) this numberhad diminished, but he speaks of as many as 540"decuriae" submitting to its jurisdiction. The ancient city stood upon a hill now occupiedby the village of Vido, and extended proliably to tbomarsh below; from the very numerous inscriptionsthat have been found there, it appears that therewas a temple to Liber and Libera, as well as otherbuildings dedicated to Jupiter and Diana.

(Gull*, Thesaurus, p. 241 ; Kaschc, vol.iii. pt. i. p. 1048.) When the Serbs or W. Slaves occupied thiscountry in the reign of Heraclius, Narenta, as itwas called, was one of the four " banats " into whichthe Servians were divided. The Narentine pirates,who for three centuries had been the terror of Dal­matia and the Venetian tracers, were in A. D. 997entirely crushed by the fleet of Venice, commandedby the Doge in person.

The Thes-xnlians, after their defeat, took refuge on MountNarthacium, between which and a place namedPros, Agexilaus set up a trophy. On the follow­ing day he crossed the mountains of the Achaean1'hthiolis. (Xen. Hell. iv. 3. §§ 3—9; Ages. 2.§§ 3—5; Pint. Apvp/ith. p. 211; Diod. xiv. 82.)Narthacium is accordingly placed by Leake andKicpert south of Pharsalus in the valley of theEnipeus ; and the mountain of this name is probablythe one which rises immediately to the southward ofFtrtola. Leake supposes the town of Narthaciumto have bean on the mountain not far from upper Tjaterli, and Pras near lower TjaterU. (SorOurmGreece, vol. iv. p. 471, scq.)

(Diod. xiv. 82.) In 352 Xaryx was talusby Phayllus, the Phocian commander. (Diod. xvi.38.) It is placed by some at Talanda, bat byLeake at the small village of Kalapodhi, where therearc a few ancient remains. (Northern Gretas, voL n.p. 187.) As Locri in Bruttium in Italy wag, ac­cording to some of the ancients, a colony of Xaryx(Virg. Am. iii. 399), the epithet of Naryciaa iafrequently given to the Bruttian pitch. (Virg.

(Comp. ii. 32, iv. 172.) Theyappear, however, to have occupied at one time partof Cyrenaica and the Syrtes. Strabo (xvii. p. 857)places them at the Greater Syrtis, and beyond thrxatile Psylli, whoseterritory, according to both Herod. <a»and Strabo, they appropriated to themselves. Pliny(v. 5. s. 5) says that the Nasamoncs were originallynamed Mesamones by the Greeks, because tbey dweltbetween two quicksands—the Syrtes. Ptolemy (iv. 5.§ 21) and Diodorus (iii. 3) again remove theui to tLeinland region of Augila: and all these description*may, at the time they were « ritlen, have hero near thetruth; since notonly were the Nasamunes, as Xouia<ie>,a wandering race, but they were also prosed upon bythe Greeks of Cyrene, on the one side, and by theCarthaginians, on the other. For when, at a lawrperiod, the boundaries of Carthage and the RapoCyrenaica touched at the I'hileliian Altars, whackwere situated in the inmost recesses of the Syrtea, ixis evident that the Nasatnones must have been dis­placed from a tract which at one time brimmed latliem.

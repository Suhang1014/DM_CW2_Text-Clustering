OCR Output B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 285 Amidst these employments of both parties, which.were nothing less than most earnest preparations on allsides, as if war was just in its commencement, the Eu-bœans took the lead, and sent embassadors this winterto treat with Agis about a revolt from the Athenians.Agis accepted what terms they proposed; and sendsfor Alcamenes, the son of Sthenelai'das, and Melanthus,frorrr Lacedæmon, to pass over as commanders intoEubcea. Accordingly they arrived, with a body of *ci­tizens newly infranchised, to the number of about threehundred; and Agis was preparing for their transporta­tion. But in this interval the Lesbians arrived, withdeclarations of their readiness to revolt; and, as theywere seconded by the recommendations of the Bœotians,Agis is persuaded to put off for a time the affair of Eu­bcea, and began to expedite the revolt of the Lesbians,having assigned them Alcamenes for their governor, whowas to have passed over to Eubœa. The Bœotianspromised to send them ten ships, and Agis ten. Thesepoints were transacted without the privity of the Lace­dæmonian State: For Agis, so long as he continued atDecelea, having under his command the army of theState, was invested with a power of sending detachmentswhithersoever he thought proper, and to levy men andmoney at his own discretion; and it may withtruth be affirmed, that the confederates, duringthis period, paid a much greater deference to himthan to the State of Lacedæmon; for, having a power­ful force under his own orders, he was formidable in hisevery motion. And thus he arbitrarily settled the ne­gotiation of the Lesbians. But then the Chians and the Erythræans, who werealso desirous to revolt, addressed themselves, not to A-gis, but at Lacedæmon. In their company also wentthither an embassador from Tissaphernes, who was lieu­tenant for Darius, the son of Anaxerxes, in the mari- * Neodamodes. time

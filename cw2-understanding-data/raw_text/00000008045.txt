The loss seems tohave fallen especially upon the nobles and wealthiercitizens, so that it became the occasion ot'a politicalrevti] hi i m, and the government, which had pre-viourdv been an aristocracy, became thenceforth apure democracy. (Arist. Pol. v. 3.) Of the in­ternal condition and constitution of Tarentum pre­viously to this time, we know scarcely anything,but it seems probable that its institutions were atfirst copied from those of the parent city of Sparta.Aristotle speaks of its government as a iroAtTcia, inthe sense of a mixed government or common wealth;while Herodotus incidentally notices a king of Ta­rentum (iii. 156), not long before the Persian War,who was doubtless a king after the Spartan model.The institutions ot a democratic tendency noticedwith commendation by Aristotle {Pol. vi. 5) pro­bably belong to the later and democratic period ofthe constitution. We hear but little also of Tarentumin connection with the revolutions arising out of theinfluence exercised by the Pythagoreans: that secthad apparently not established itself bo stronglythere as in the Achaean cities; though many Taren-tincs are enumerated among the disciples of Pytha­goras, and it is clear that the city had not altogetherescaped their influence. (Iambi. Vit. Pyth, 262,Porphyr. Vit Pyth, 56.) The defeat of the Tarentines by the Messapians,which is referred by Diodorus to B. C-473 (Diod.xi. 52). is the first event in the history of Tarentumto which we can assign a definite date. Great asthat blow may have been, it did not produce anypermanent effect in checking the progress of thecity, which still appears as one of the most flourish­ing in Magna Graecia. We next hear of the Ta­rentines as interfering to prevent the Thurians, whohad been recently established in Italy, from makingthemselves masters of the district of the Siritis.On what grounds the Tarentines could lay claim tothis district, which was separated from them by theintervening territory of Melaponturn, we are not in­formed; but they carried on war for some timeagainst the Thurians, who were supported by theSpartan exile Cleandridas; until at length the dis­pute was terminated by a compromise, and a newcolony named Heracleia was founded in the con­tested territory (b. c. 432). in which the citizens ofboth states participated, but it was agreed thatit should be considered as a colony of Tarentum.(Antioch. up. Strab. vi. p. 204; Diod. xii. 23, 36.)At the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily,the Tarentines kept aloof from the contest, andcontented themselves with refusing all suppliesand assistance to the Athenian fleet (Time. vi.44), while they afforded shelter to the Corinthianand Laconian ships under Gylippua {lb. 104),but they did not even prevent the second fleetunder Demosthenes and Eurymedon from touch­ing at the islands of the Choerades, immediatelyopposite to the entrance of their harbour, and takingon board some auxiliaries furnished by the Messa­pians. (Id. vii. 33.) Another long interval now elapses, during whichthe history of Tarentum is to us almost a blank;yet the tew notices we hear of the city represent itas in a slate of great prosperity. We are toldthat at one time (apparently about 380—360 B.C.)Archytas, the Pythagorean philosopher, exercised aparamount influence over the government, and tilled the office of Strategus or eeneral no Te^> 4dar, sr^itimes, though it was prohibited by Uw u- &sc zmore than once; and was successful in <as»paign.

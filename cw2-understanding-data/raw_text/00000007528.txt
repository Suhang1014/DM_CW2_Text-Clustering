But Agrippa,- whenhe was made Sensible of their intentions and preparations, healso prepared to go thither; and as soon as they heard they set sail,he sent Fortunatus, one of his freed-mea, to Rome, to carrv pre­sents to the emperory and letters against Herody and to give Caiusa particular account of those matters, if he should have any op­portunity. This man followed Herod so-quick, and had so pros­perous a voyage, and came so little after Herod, that while He­rod was with Caius, he came himself, and delivered his letters;for they both sailed to Dicearchiaj and found Caius at Baiae,which is itself a little city of Campania, at the distance of aboutfive furlongs from Dicearehia. There are in that place royalpalaces, with sumptuous apartments, every emperov still endea­vouring to out-do his predecessor's magnificence : the place alsoaffords warm baths, that spring out of the ground of their ownaccord, which are of advantage for the recovery of the health ofthose that make use of them, and, besides, they minister to men'sluxury also.

But when he was informed that Herodias wasAgrippa's sister, he made her a present of what money was herown, and told her, that u it was her brother who prevented her" being put under the same calamity with her husband." Butshe made this reply; " Thou, indeed, O emperor ! actest after a" magnificent manner, and as becomes thyself in what thou of-" ferest me ; but the kindness which I have for my husband bin-" ders me from partaking of the favour of thy gift; for it is not" just, that I, who have been made a partner in his prosperity," should forsake him in his misfortunes."

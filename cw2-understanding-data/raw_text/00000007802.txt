OCR Output MARATHON. MARATHUS. 269 The exact ground occupied by the Greek andPersian armies at the battle of Marathon can onlybe a matter of conjecture. Col. Leake, whoseaccount is both probable and consistent, though Mr.1 ■ ■ !■■ differs from him, supposes that the Athe­nian camp was in the valley of I rand near its open­ing into the plain: that on the day of battle theAthenian line extended from a little in front ofthe Heracleium, at the foot of Mt. Argaliki,to the bend of the river of Marathona, below thevillage of Seftrri; and that the Persians, who were8 tUdia in front of them, had their right resting onMt. Koraki, and their left extending to the southernmarsh, which prevented them from having a frontmuch greater than that of the Athenians. (SeePlan. AA, BB.) When the Persians defeated theAthenian centre, they pursued the latter up one orboth of the two valleys on either side of Mt. Kotroni, since Herodotus says that the pursuitcontinued quite into the interior («s rty fitvoyatav').Nearly at the tame time the Persian left and rightwere defeated; but instead of pursuing them, theAthenians returned towards the field to the aid oftheir own centre. The Persian right fled towardsthe narrow pass leading into the plain of Tricory-thus; and here numbers were forced into the marsh,as Pausanias relates.

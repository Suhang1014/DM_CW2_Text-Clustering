Jornandes, de Rtb.Get. c. 2.) MAEDI (Maioof, M«r5oi, Thuc, n. 98; Polyb. x.41). a powerful people in the west of Thrace,dwelling near the sources of the Axius and Margus,and upon the southern slopes of Mt. Scomius.(Leake, Nortliern Greece, vol. iii. p. 472.) Strabosays that the Maedi bordered eastward on the Thu-natae of Dardania (vii. p. 316), and that the Axiusflowed through their territory (vii. p. 331). Thelatter was called Maedica (MaiiiKt), Ptol. iii. 11.§ 9; Liv. xxvi. 25, xl. 22). They frequently madeincursions into Macedonia ; but in B.C. 211, PhilipV. invaded their territory, and took their chief townIamphorina, which is probably represented by Vranidor Irorina, in the upper valley of the Margus orMorara. (Liv. xxvi. 25.) We also learn from Livy(xl. 22) that the same king traversed their territoryin order to reach the summit of Mt. Haemus; andthat on his return into Macedonia he received thesubmission of Petm, a fortress of the Maedi. Amongthe other places in Maedica, we read of l'hragandae(Lir. xxvi. 25) and Desudaba, probably the modernKtimanoco, on one of the confluents of the upperAxius. (Liv. xliv. 26.) The Maedi are said to havebeen of the same race as the Bithynians in Asia, andwere hence called Maedobithyni (Steph. B. *. v.MaiSoi ; Strab. vii. p. 295). (Comp. Strab. vii.p. 316; Plin. iv. 11. s. 18.) MAENACA (Mcm-dmi), a Greek city on the S.coast of Hispania Baetica, the most westerly colonyof the Phucaeans. (Strab. iii. p. 156; Scymn. 145, etseq.) In Strabo's time it had been destroyed; but theruins were still visible. He refutes the error of thosewho confoundi*d it with Malaca, which was not aGreek, but a Phoenician city, and lay further to theW.; but this error is repeated by Avienus (Or.Slnrit. 426, et seq.). The place seems to be theMate) of Stephanus. [P. S.] MAE'NALUS. 1. (MaimKos, Strab. viii. p. 388;Schol. ad Apoll.

Met. i.216), a lofty mountain of Arcadia, forming thewestern boundary of the territories of Mantincia andTegea. It was especially sacred to the god Pan,who is hence called Maenalim Deta (Ov. Faff. iv.650.) The inhabitants of the mountain fanciedthat they had frequently heard the god playing onhis pipe. The two highest summits of the moun­tain are called at present Aidin and Apano-Khripa:the latter is 5115 feet high. The mountain is atpresent covered with pines and firs; the chief passthrough it is near the modern town of Tripolitza.—The Roman poets frequently use the adjectivesMaenalvis and Maenalis as equivalent to Arcadian.Hence Maenalii verstu. shepherds' songs, such uswere usual in Arcadia (Virg. EcL viii.21); Maenalisora,i.e. Arradia(Ov. Font. iii.84); Maenalunympha,i. e. Camienta (Ov.

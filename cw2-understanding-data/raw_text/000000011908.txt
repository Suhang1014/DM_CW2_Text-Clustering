VI.] AND THE ATTEMPT OF DRUSUS AT REFORM. 223 democracy, since the power of the oligarchy mainly restedon their free control over the provinces and was endangeredby any permanent military command; the ideas of equalizingItaly and the provinces and of making conquests beyondthe Alps were not compatible with conservative principles.But the senate might very well sacrifice the Latin and eventhe Campanian domains as well as Sicily in order to raisethe Italian farmer class, and yet retain the government asbefore; to which fell to be added the consideration, thatthey could not more effectually obviate future agitationsthan by providing that all the land at all disposable shouldbe brought to distribution by the aristocracy itself, and thataccording to Drusus' own expression, nothing should be leftfor future demagogues to distribute but "the dirt and thedaylight." In like manner it was for the government—whether that might be a monarch, or a close number of rulingfamilies—very much a matter of indifference, whether thehalf or the whole of Italy possessed the Roman franchise;and hence the reforming men on both sides probably couldnot but light upon the idea of averting the danger of arecurrence of the insurrection of Fregellae on a larger scaleby a judicious and reasonable extension of the franchise, andof seeking allies, moreover, for their plans in the numerousand influential Italians. While in the question of theheadship of the state the views and designs of the two greatpolitical parties were palpably different, the best men of bothcamps had many points of contact in their means of opera­tion and in their reforming tendencies ; and, as Scipio iEmi-lianus may be named alike among the adversaries of TiberiusGracchus and among the promoters of his reforming efforts,so Drusus was the successor and disciple no less than theantagonist of Gaius. The two high-born and high-mindedyouthful reformers had a greater resemblance than wasapparent at the first glance; and, personally also, the twowere not unworthy to meet, as respects the substance oftheir patriotic endeavours, in purer and higher views abovethe obscuring mists of prejudiced partisanship. The question at stake was the passing of the laws drawn Discussionsup by Drusus. Among these the proposer, just like Gaius on the Li-Gracchus, kept in reserve for the moment the hazardous Tian laws-proposal to confer the Roman franchise on the Italian allies,and brought forward at first only the laws as to the jury­men, the assignation of land, and the distribution of grain.

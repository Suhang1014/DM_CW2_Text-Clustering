The arrival of Honorius at Milan waswelcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games ofthe circus; and the emperor, though he was op­pressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed byhis presence to the public joy. But the remains ofhis strength were exhausted by the painful effortwhich he made to assist at the spectacles of themorning. Honorius supplied, during the rest of theday, the place of his father; and the great Theodo­sius expired in the ensuing night. Notwithstandingthe recent animosities' of a civil war, his death wasuniversally lamented. The Romans were terrifiedby the impending dangers of a feeble and dividedadministration; and every disgraceful moment of theunfortunate reigns of Arcadius and Honorius revivedthe memory of their irreparable loss.

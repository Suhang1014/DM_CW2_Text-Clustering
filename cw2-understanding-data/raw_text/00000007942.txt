MUX)According to an incredible account in Solinus(i. 13).it wan a pate of the old Satuniian city, and was ori-pinally t ailed Porta Satumia; n-r is the versionof Pulyaentu more satisfactory (Stratag. viii. 3">).who refers the story of the Porta Pan<iaua to thetreaty with the Gaul-, by which the Etonians en-gaped always to have one pate open, but, in orderto evade the consequences, built it in an inaccessiblephu-e. After ]>eare had been concluded between Romulusand Tatius, they possessed two distinct but unitedcities,—the former reigning on the Palatine, thelatter on the Capitoline, and. dwelling on the spotwhi-re thf temple of Juno Muueta afterwards stood(Pint. Horn. 2: Sol. i. 21.) When Tacitus says,in the passage before cited, that latins added theCapil iline to the city, we are perhaps therefore tounderstand that he built u»<on it and made it habit­able, whilst previously it had been only a port ofmilitary outpost. The valley between the two hillsformed a kind of neutral ground, and served as ac'inmon market-place. The pate called Janualis,mentioned by Varro in the passage cited from himwhen treating of the Ilomub-an irate.-., seems undoubt­edly to have belonged tothe Sabine town. Kiebubr,who is followed by Bunsen (Btschr. vol. i. p. 14."»).is of opinion (Hist, i. that it was built by the two cities as a barrier of their common liberties;that it was open in time of war in order that suc­cour inipht priss from one to the other, and shutduring peace, cither to prevent the quarrels whichmight arise from unrestricted intercourse, or as atoken that the cities, though united, were distinct.Becker, on the other hand, denies that it ever was apat.- nt nil, maintaining that it only pot that namecaUirhrettumlly, from the temple which it subse­quently formed being called " Porta Belli" (pp. 118,1 19, and note lu7). Ii it there seems to be amplee\ idence that it was originally a cate. Varro, in thepassage cited, evidently considered it as such; andit is also mentioned by Macrnbius as a real gate,though the situation which he assigns to it willhardly be allowed even by those who give the great­est extent ion to the w alls of the I tornu lean city(" Cum bello Sabmo—Hon tan i portam, quae sub ra-dteihus collis Viminalis erat, quae postea ex eventuJtutuniit vocata est, claudere festmarent,'' Sat. i.9).

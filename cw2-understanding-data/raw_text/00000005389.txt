Herodian, I. iii.P- 135- [18] Mr. Hume is justly surprised at a passage ofHerodian, (i iv. p. 159.) who, on this occasion, re­presents the imperial palace, as equal io extent tothe rest of Rome. The whole region of the Pala­tine Mount on which it was built, occupied, .at most,a circumference of eleven or twelve thousand feet.(See the Notitia and Victor, in Nardini's RomaAntica.) But we should recollect that the opulentsenators had almost surrounded the city with theirextensive gardens and suburb palaces, the greatestpart of which had been gradually confiscated bythe emperors, if Geta resided in the gardens thatbore his name on the Janiculum; and if Caracalla.inhabited the gardens o* Mecænas on the Efque-line, the rival brothers were separated from eachother by the distance of several miles; and yetthe in termed fa re space was filled by the imperialgardens of Salluft, of Lucullus, of Agrippa, of Do­mitian, of Caius, &c. all skirting round the city,and all connected with each other, and with thepalace, by bridges thrown over the Tyber and thestreets. But this explanation of Herodian wouldrequire, though it ill deserves, a particular disserta-ition, illustrated by a map of ancient Rome. [19] Herodian, 1. 5v. p. 139. [20] Herodian, 1. iv. p. 144. [21] Caracalla consecrated, in the temple of Se-rapis, the sword, with which, a« he boasted, he hadiain his brother Gets, Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1307. [22] Herodian, I. iv. p. 147.. In every Romancamp there was a small chapel near the head­quarters, in which the statues of the tutelar deitieswere preserved and adored; and we may remark,that the eagles, and other military ensigns, were inthe first rank of these deities: an excellent institu­tion, which confirmed discipline by the sanctionof religion. See Lipsius de Militia Romana, iv. 5.«. 2. [23] Herodian, 1. iv. p. 148. Dion, 1. Ixxvii,p* 1289. [24] Geta was placed among the gods. Sit divut,dum non fit minus, said his brother. Hist. August,p. 91. Some marks of Geta's consecration arcstill found upon medals. [25] Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1307.. [26] Dion, 1 Ixxvii. p. 1290. Herodian, 1. iv..p. 1 50. Dion (p. 129S.) fays, that the comic poetsno longer durst employ the name of Geta in theirplays, and that the estates of those who mentionedit in their testaments,. were confiscated. [27] Caracalla had assumed the names of several,conquered nations; Pertinax observed, that thename of Giticut (he had obtained some advantage ofthe Goths or Getæ) would be a proper addition to>Parthicus, Alemannicus, &c. Hist. August, p. 89. [2S] Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1291. He was proba­bly descended from Helvidius Prifcus, and ThraseaPætus, those patriots whose firm, but useless and'unscasonable virtue, has been immortalized by.Tacitus. [29] It is said, that Papinian was himself a rela*tion of the empress Julia. [$o] Tacit. Annal. xiv. ii. £31] Hist. August, p. 88. [32] With regard to Papinian, see Heineccius'sHistoria Juris Romani, 1. 33c, &c. [33] Tiberius and Domitian never moved from •the neighbourhood of .Rome. Nero made a shortjourney into Greece. "Et laudatorum Principumufus ex æquo quamvis procul agentibus. S«eviproximisingruunt." Tacit. Hist. iv. 75. [34] Dion, 1. lxxviL p. 1294. [35] Dion, L Ixxvii. p. 1307. Herodian, 1. iv.p. 1 58. The former represents it as a cruel massacre,the latter as a perfidious one too. it seems pro­bable, that the Alexandrian* had irritated the ty­rant

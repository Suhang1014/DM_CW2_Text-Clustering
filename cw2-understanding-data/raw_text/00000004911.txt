OCR Output NOTES ON THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER. lv I will venture to recommend as one of the bellversions extant. [67] Hist. Armen. I. ii. c. 76. I have transferredthis exploit of Tiridates from an imaginary defeatto the real one of Galerius. [68] Ammian. Marcellin. L xiv. The mile, inthe hands of Eutropiui (ix. 24.)> ofFestus (c. 25.),and of Orosius (vii. 25 ), easily increased to ftvtralmiles, [69] Aurelius Victor. Jornandes de rebus Ge-ticis, c. 21. [70] Aurelius Victor fays, "Per Armeniam inhostes contendit, qua: ferme sola, feu facilior vin-cendi via est." He followed the conduct of Trajan,and the idea of Julius Cæsar. [71] Xenophon's Anabasis, 1. iii. For that reasonthe Persian cavalry encamped sixty stadia from theenemy. [72] The story is told by Ammianus, 1. xxii.Instead of saccunt some read scutum. [73] The Persians confessed the Roman superio­rity in morals as well as in arms. Eutrop. ix. 24.But this respect and gratitude of enemies is very sel­dom to be found in their own accounts. [74] The account of the negociation is takenfrom the fragments of Peter the Patrician, in theExcerpta Legationum published in the ByzantineCollection. Peter lived under Justinian; but it is veryevident, by the nature of his materials, that theyare drawn from the most authentic and respectablewriters. [75] Adeo Victor (fays Aurelius) ut ni Valerius,cujus nutu omnia gerebantur, abnuiflet, Romanifasces in provinciam novam ferrentur. Verumpars terrarum tamen nobis utilior quæsita. [76] He had been governor of Sumium. (Pet,Patricius in Excerpt. Legat. p. 30.) This provinceseems to be mentioned by Moses of Chorene (Geo-graph. p. 360.), and lay to the East of MountArarat. (77] By an error of the geographer Ptolemy,the position of Singara is removed from the Aborts to the Tigris, which may have produced the mistakeof Peter, in assigning the latter river for the boun­dary, instead of the former. The line of the Romanfrontier traversed, but never followed, the course ofthe Tigris. [78] Procopius de Edificiis, 1. ii. c. 6. [79] Three of the provinces, Zabdicene, Ar.zanene, and Carduene, are allowed on all sides.But instead of the other two, Peter (in Excerpt.Leg. p. 30.) inserts Rehimene and Sophcne. Ihave preferred Ammianus, (1. xxv. 7.) because itmight be proved, that Sophene was never in thehands of the Persians, either before the reign ofDiocletian, or after that of Jovian. For want ofcorrect maps, like those of M. Danville, almost allthe moderns, with Tillemont and Valesius at theirhead, have imagined, that it was in respect toPersia, and not to Rome, that the five provinceswere situate beyond the Tigris. [80] Xenophon's Anabasis, 1. iv. Their bowswere three cubits in length, their arrows two; theyrolled down stones that were each a waggon load.The Greeks found a great many villages in thatrude country. [81] According to Eutropius (vi. 9. as the textis represented by the best MSS.) the city of Tigra-nocerta was in Arzanene. The names and situationof the other three may be faintly traced. [82] Compare Herodotus, 1. i. c. 97. with MosesChoronens. Hist. Armen. 1. ii. c. 84. and the mapos Armenia given by his editors.

Tillthe discovery of the treatise De Mortibus Persecu-torum, it was not certain that the triumph and th«Vicennalia were celebrated at the fame time.

Book XV. asked for, ajid obtained, the power over them from the emperor,who gave command to Vitellius, who was then commander inSyria, to give it them accordingly. Before that time, they werekept under the seal of the high priest, and of the treasurers ofthe temple; which treasurers, the day before a festival, wentup to the Roman captain of the temple guards, and viewedtheir own seal, and received the vestments; and again, whenthe festival was over, they brought them to the same place, andshowed the captain of the temple guards their seal, which cor­responded with his seal, and reposited them there. And thatthese things were so, the afflictions that happened to us after­ward [about them] are sufficient evidence: But for the tgvyeritself, when Herod the king of the Jews had fortified it morefirmly than before, in order to secure and guard the temple, hegratified Antonius, who was his friend, and the Roman ruler,and then gave it the name of the Tower pf Antonia. 5.

This cloister had pillars that stoodin four rows one over against the other all along, for the fourthrow was interwoven into the wall, which [also was built ofstone;] and the thickness of each pillar was such, that threemen might, with their arms extended, fathom it round, andjoin their hands again, while its length was twenty-seven feetwith a double spiral at its basis; and the number of all the piL-lars [in that court] was a hundred and sixty-two.

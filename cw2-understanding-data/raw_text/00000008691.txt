It is stated to hare been 30 stadiawn Hippo, 60 from Gudara, and 120 from Scytbo-u!ii (Joseph, Vit. 65); distances which are not u'-h at variance with that of Jolifle, who statesbl it is 20 miles English from Nazareth and 90tjii Jerusalem. ( Travels, p. 40.) Knun the time of Herodes Antipas to that of theOCD of Agrippa II-, Tiberias was probably theil.tal of the province (Joseph. I'tt 9), and it was:e uf the four cities which Nero added to theiiirlom of Agrippa. (Joseph. Ant. xx. 8. § 4.)i the last Jewish War, Tiberias, from its greatr^ifith, played an important part (Joseph. B. J. ii.'i); as, after Sepphoris, it was held to be theirgest place in Galilaea (Joeicph, Vit. 65), and wassry strongly fortified, (B. J. iii. 10. § I.) The^ai>itanta derived their sustenance in great mea-lre from tbeir fisheries in the adjoining sea.I.*cph. Vit. 12.) On the destruction of Jeru-Jct, and for several centuries subsequently, rrias was famous for its academy of learnedrwi. (Lightfoot, fair. Ilebr. p. 140.) In the immediate neighbourhood of Tiberias were • celebrated hot springs of Knunaus (Joseph.. J. ii. 21, Ant. xviii. 2.) [F.mmais.] It is notrtain whether Tiberias occupied the site of Chin-nth. though Hieronymus thinks so ((?nom. s. v.k\nivrtth) : it seems more likely that this place: mfed to the tribe of Naphthali. (Josh. xix.i; lirland, Palaart. p. 161.) Nor is there any betteri*cn for identifying it, as some have done, withhimmath (Joseph, xix. 35) or Uakkah, which was•• l^bbinical notion. (Cf. Hieron. Megil. fol. 701 jtflitfoot, Churograph. Cent. cap. 72—74.) The»!an name of Tiberias is Tabarieh: it is not,■ icrtr, built Actually on the site of the old town,-i.'li close to its ruins. When Joliffe was there, itd a population of 11,000 (Travels, pp 48—58.)*u nearly destroyed by an earthquake on Newair's Day, 1837, since which time it has nevern> completely rebuilt.

[V.]TIBE'RIAS MAKE (Al^m T.*V«, Pausan. v.§ 4; PtoL v. 16. § 4; \lfun\ ij 'liGtplav, Joseph.J. iv. 26), the principal lake or sea of Palestine in • frTince ot' Galilaea. It was bordered on the. tide by the tribes of Issachar and Zabulon, and the E. by the half-tribe of Manassch. TheHers were fresh (Joseph. B. J. iii. 35) and11 rf Gab (Joseph. B. J. iv. 26; Malik, iv.1; Late, v. 1, &c), and its size is variouslyttal, by Joscphus (/. c), to have been 140 stadia ; ' v 40 broad, and by Pliny, to have I cen 16 M. P.it and 6 M. P. broad (r. 15). It was traversed a direction NW. and SE. by the river Jordan.oKDaXn: Palakstina.] This sea is known many different names in the Bible and profane tcf*. Ita eurliest title would seem to have been.:/Trth (.VfimA. xxxiv. 11; Joth. xiii 27; LXX'rrtpii.)

A thirdilaiioa it has derived from the province withm!i it was most nearly connected, viz. the sea ofihlee (MAsiTira ttji raAiAaiar, Mattk. iv. 18;ort, vil 31, 4c.; and with a double title, SdAewa rijs TaAiAaiar, TTjr Ti&pIaSos, John vi. 1). Pliny,in describing the same localities, speaks of a towncalled Taricliaea, from whence also he says theadjoining lake was sometimes named (I. c; cf.also Strab. xvi. p. 764). The present name isBakr-al-Tabarieh. (Pococke, ii. p. 103; Thevenotp. 387; Hoselquist, i. p. 181; Kobinson, iii. pp. 499—509, &c) [V.] TIBEItlO'POLIS (TieVpiowroAis), a town inPhrygia Major, in the neighbourhood of Eumenia.(PtoL v. 2. § 25; Socrat. Hut. Eccla. vii. 46.)Its site is yet uncertain, but Kiepert (in Franz,Funf Intchrij'ten, p. 33) is disposed to regard theextensive ruins near Suleiman as the remnants ofTiberiopolis. Hamilton (Retearchu, i. p. 127, foil.),probably more correctly, regards them as the ruinsof lilaundos. (Comp. Aruudell, Ditcottriri, i. p.81, foil.) [L. S.] Ti'BERIS (o Tiff pit: Term, Tiber : the formsTibris, Tybris, and Thybris are chiefly poetical, asis QvuSpts also in Greek: the Latin poets use alsoTiberinus as an adjective form, as Tiberinus pater,Tiberinum fluinen, &c, and thence sometimes Ti­berinus by itself as the name of the river), one ofthe most important rivers of Central Italy. It hasits sources in the Apennines above Tifemum, hut inthe territory of Arretium (Plin. iii. 5. s. 9), on theconfines of Etruria and Umbria, and flows at first ina southerly direction, passing by the walls of Tifer-num. which derived from it the name of Tiberinum(Citta iii CastiUd),am\ afterwards within a few milesof Perusia on the E.,and within a still shorter distanceto the W. of Tuder ( 7Wi). From thence it still pre­serves a general S. direction, notwithstanding consi­derable windings, till it receives the waters of theAnio (Tertrone), a few miles from the walls ofRome, from which point it has a general SW. courseto the sea at Ostia. Pliny estimates the upper partof its course at 150 miles, to which must be addedabout 35 more for the lower part, giving as a total185 miles ( Plin. /. c ; Strab. v. p. 218); but this es­timate is below the truth, the whole course of theriver being about 180 geogr. or 225 Roman miles.During the whole of its course from Tifemum to thes«i the Tiber formed in ancient times the easternboundary of Etruria, separating that country fromUmbria in the upper |>art of its course, afterwardsfrom the territory of the Sabines, and, in the lowerpart, from the mouth of the Anio downwards, divid­ing it from Latium. (Strab. T. p. 219; Plin. /.<-.)It receives numerous confluents or tributaries, ofwhich the most important are, the Tixia, an incon­siderable stream which joins it from the E. a littlebelow Perusia, bringing with it the waters of themore celebrated Ciitumnus; the Clanis, whichfalls into it from the right bank, descending from themarshy tract near Clusium; tho Nab, a muchmore considerable stream, which is joined by theVeijnus a few miles above Interamna. and dis­charges their combined waters into the Tiber, a fewmiles above Ocriculum; and the Anio, which fallsinto the Tilier at Antetnnae, 3 miles above Rome.These are the only affluents of the Tiber of any geo­graphical importance, but among its minor tributa­ries, the Allia on its left bank, a few miles abovethe Anio, and the Ckk.mf.ua on the rinht, are namesof historical celebrity, though very trifling streams,the identification of which is by no means certain.[See the respective articles.] Two other streams ofless note, which descend from the land of the Sabine*and fall into the Tiber between Ocriculum and Ere­

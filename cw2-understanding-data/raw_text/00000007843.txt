Ii. s. v.). a town of great antiquity andconsiderable size, was .situated nearly in the centre ofthe Delta, upon an island formed by tlie Sebennyticand Phatnitic branches of the Nile. It belonged tothe Sebennytic Nome. The 14th dynasty, accord­ing to Manetho, consisted of 7G Xoite kings. Thisdynasty immediately preceded that of the shepherdkings of Aogypt. It seems probable, therefore, thatXois, from its strong position among the marshesfunned by the intersecting branches of the river,held out during the occupation of the Delta by thellyksos, or at least compromised with the invadersby paying them tribute. By some geographers itis supposed to be the Papremis of Herodotus (ii. 59,iii. 12). Champollion (VEgypte sous les Pharaons,vol. ii. p. 214) believes its site to have been atSakkra. which is the Arabian synonyme of theCoptic Xeos and of the old Aegyptian Slchoo (Niebuhr.Travels, vol. i. p. 75.) The road from Tamiathis toMemphis passed through Xois. [W.B.D.] XYLENO'POLIS, a town said by Pliny, on theauthority it would seem of Oncsicritus or Nearchns,to have been founded by Alexander the Great (vi.23. s. 26).

Ewtfi5s), atown near the .southern confines of Thessaly, and thedistrict of the Aenianes (Liv. xxxiii. 3), which gaveits name to the lake Xynias (HuWas), which Ste-phamis confounds with the Boebeis (Apollon. Rhod. 1. 67; Catull. Ixiii. 287.; Steph. B. s. v. Bwia).Xynia, having been deserted by its inhabitants, wasplundered by the Aetolians in it. c. 198 (Liv. xxxii.13). In the following year Flamininus arrived atthis place in three days'march from Hcraclea (Liv.xxxiii. 3; comp. Liv. xxxix. 26). The lake of Xy­nias is now called TanHi, and is described as 6 milesin circumference. The site of the ancient city ismarked by .some remains of ruined edifices upon apromontory or peninsula in the lake. (Leake, North-em Greece, vol. i. p. 46U, vol. iv. p. 517.) XY'PETE.

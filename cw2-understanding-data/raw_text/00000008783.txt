These hanks werefamous in former times among the professors ofpharmacy, who are advised by Nicander (Therinca,v. GOT) to gather the "Iris" there. (Plin. xiii. 2,xxi. 19; Theophr. op.

It appears from the letters of P.Vatinius to Cicero (ad Fam. v. 9, 10), dated Xarona,that the Romans made it their head-quarters dur­ing their conquest of Dalmatia. (Comp. Pomp. Mela, ii. 3. § 13; Itin. Anton.; Pent. Tab. ■ Geog. Rav.iv. 16.) Karona was a "convent us," at which,according to M. Varro (np Plin. iii. 2f>) 89 citiesassembled; in tlie time of Pliny (/. c.) this numberhad diminished, but lie speaks of as many as 540"decuriae" submitting to its jurisdiction. The ancient city stood upon a hill now occupiedby the Village of Vido, and extended probably to themarsh below; from the very numerous inscriptionsthat have been found there, it appears that therewas a temple to Liber and Libera, as well as otherbuildings dedicated to Jupiter and Diana.

NapQaKtevt),the name of a ftty and mountain of Phthiotis inThessaly, in the neighbourhood of which Agesilaua,on his return from Asia in n. c. 394, gained avictory over the Thessalian cavalry. The Thes-Batians, after their defeat, took refuge on MountNarthacium, between which and a place namedPras, Agesilaus set up a trophy. On the follow­ing day he crossed the mountains of the AchaeanPhthiotis. (Xen. Hell. iv. 3. §§3—9; Ages. 2. 3—5; Plat. Apophth. p. 211; Died, xiv. 82.)Narthacium is accordingly placed by Leake andKiepert south of Pharsalu.s in the valley of theEriipeus ; and the mountain of this name i» probablythe one which rises immediately to the southward ofFirscda. Leake supposes the town of Narthaciumto have been on the mountain not far from upper Ijaterli, and Pras near lower Tjaterli. (Xortten(iret-ee, vol. iv. p. 471, ^eq.)

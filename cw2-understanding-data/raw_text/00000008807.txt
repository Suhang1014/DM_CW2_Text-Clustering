There is however some cor- Iruption in the passage (note of Lindeiibros). 'J'he jplaces seem to be mentioned in order from north tosouth. D'Anville conjectures that Quadribursrium ,is the same place as Burpnatium [BuitciNA- iticm], following Cluver and Alting, (Ukert,Gallten, p. 52S.)

Neither passage affords the slightest clue toits position, and the name is not elsewhere mentioned;indeed, it seems certain that the place was not inexistence at a later period.

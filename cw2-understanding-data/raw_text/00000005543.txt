Tobe in love indeed with a shadow, and not to know thedifference between a man and the shadow of a man, isstupidity in the extreme. But there is another reportconcerning Narcissus, which is less known thrn the formerone -, and this is, that he had a twin sister, who perfectlyresembled him in her whole form, that her hair and dresswere similar to those of Narcissus, and that they used togo out together to hunt. That Narcissus fell in Jove withthis sister ; and that slie happening to die before hini, heused to come to this fountain, in which, when he sawhis own shadow, without at the same time perceiving thatit was his own, he found some mitigation of the tormentsof his love, by imagining that it was the image of his sister.It appears to me, however, that the earth produced theflower Narcissus, prior to this circumstance; and mÂ»opinion is confirmed by the verses of Pamphus. For hefays, that many years before the Thespian Narcissus,Proserpine the daughter of Ceres was forcibly takenaway by Pluto, as she was playing and gathering flowers jand that she was deceived not by violets, but by theparcissus.

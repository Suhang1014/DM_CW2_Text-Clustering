(Comp. ii. 5, 7, and J wig. iv. with Josephus, Ant. v. 1 ) He eUewbere describes the lake as 60i k^ig by 30 broad, extending its marshes to a oiled Daphne, which Beland is probably right••nag to Dane, i. e.

It is singular that no other noticesoccur of this lake in sacred or in other writings. Itsmodern name is BaJir-el-fluleh. Pocoeke writes:"Josephus says the lake was 7 miles long, but it isnot above 2 miles broad, except at the north end,where it may be about 4. The waters are muddyand esteemed unwholesome, having something of thenature of the water of a morass." (Observations onPalaestine, vol. ii. p. 73.) Dr. Robinson ** estimatedits length at about 2 hours, or from 4 to 5 geo­graphical miles; its breadth at the northern end isprobably not less than 4 miles." It had the ap­pearance almost of a triangle, tho northern part beingfar the broadest; "or rather the map gives to it insome degree the shape of a pear." (BibL Res. vol.iii. pp. 339, 340, Biblioth. Sacr. vol. i. p. 12; Stan-lev, Sinai and Palestine, p. 383, n. 1.) [G. W.]"SAMAMYCII. [Syrtica.]SA'MARA.

The districthas been already described in general, under Pa-larsttna (p. 518], where also the notice of Jo­sephus has been cited [p. 532]. It remains to adda few words concerning its extent, its special cha­racteristics, and its place in classical geography. Itlay, according to Josephus, "between Judaea andGalilee (comp. St. John, ir. 4), extending from avillage called Ginaea in the great plain (Esdraelon)to the toparchy of Acrabalta." Ginaea there can beno difficulty in identifying with the modern Jenin,at the southern extremity of the plain, on the raidfrom Nablus to Nazareth. The toparchy of Acra-batta, mentioned also by Pliny, it is difficult to de­fine: but it certainly lay between Nablus and Jericho,and therefore probably east of the toparchy of Gophnaand in the same parallel of latitude. (Eusebius,Onomast. s. v. *Aitf>a€€t Iv; Ilelaml, Paiaest. p.192.) The northern boundary of Samaria is well de­fined by a continuous line of hills, which, commencingwith Mount Carmel on the W., runs first in a SW.direction and then almost due K. to the valley of theJordan, bounding the great plain of Esdraelon on theS. Its southern boundary is not so distinctlymarked, but was probably conterminous with thenorthern limits of the tribe of Benjamin. It com*prehended the tribe of Ephraim.and the half of Ma-nasseh on this side Jordan, and, if it be extended asfar E. as Jordan, included also some part of I>*a-char, that skirted these two tribes on the E. Pliny(v. 13) reckons to Samaria the towns Neapolis, for­merly called Mamortha, Sebnste, and Gamala, whichlast is certainly erroneous. [Gamala.] Ptnletnynames Neapolis and Thena (©^a, v. 16. § 5), whichlast is evidently identical with Thanath (Oa^Af) ofthe tribe of Joseph, mentioned by Eusebius (Ono-mast s. r.), and still existing in a village namedThena, 10 miles E. of Neapolis, on the descent to theJordan. St. Jerome notes that the most preciousoil was produced in Samaria (in Hoseam, cap. xii.),and its fertility is attested bv Josephus. [G.

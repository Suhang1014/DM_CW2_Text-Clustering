[Book IV. to executioners, confiscations of goods, summary procedurewith insubordinate officers had occurred a hundred times,and the obtuse political morality of ancient civilization hadfor such things but lukewarm censure; but it was unexam­pled that the names of the outlaws should be publiclyposted up and their heads publicly exposed, that a set sumshould be fixed for the bandits who slew them and that itshould be duly entered in the public account-books, thatthe confiscated property should be brought to the hammerlike the spoil of an enemy in the public market, that thegeneral should order a refractory officer to be at once cutdown and acknowledge the deed before all the people.

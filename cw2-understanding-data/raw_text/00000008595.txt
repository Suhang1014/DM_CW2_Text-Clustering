Mela on the contrary calls it theboundary of Illyricum (ii. 4. § 3). From thetime that the Formio, a river which falls into tbeaea6 miles S. of Trieste, became fixed as the boundaryof the province! [Kokmio], there can bo no doubtthat Pliny's attribution is correct. It is probablethat Tergeste was originally a native town either ofthe Carni or Islrians, but no mention is found of itsname till after the Roman conquest, nor does itappear to have risen into a place of importance untila later jvriod. The first historical mention of it isin it. c. 51, when we learn that it was taken andplundered by a sudden incursion of the neighbour­ing barbarians (Cues. Ii. G. viii. 24; Appian, I Ityr.IS); but frotn the terms iu which it is there no­ticed it is evident that it was already a Romantown, and apparently had already received a Romancolony. It was afterwards restored, and, to protectit for the future against similar disasters, was forti­fied with a wall and towers by Octarian in B. c. 32.(Grutcr, Inter, p. 2tih\ 6.) It is certain that itenjoyed the rank of a Colonia from the time of Au­gustus, and is styled such both by Pliny and Ptolemy.(Plin. iii. 18. s. 22; I'tol. iii. I. § 27.) That em­peror also placed under the protection and authorityof (he city the neigh bourinij barbarian tribes of theCarni and Catali, and, by reducing to subjectiontheir more formidable neighbours, the lajtodes, laidthe foundations of the prosperity of Terge.ste. Thegrowth of this was mainly promoted by the advan­tages of its jxirt, which is tin; only good harbour inthis part of the Adriatic; hut it was apparently over­shadowed by the greatness of the neighbouringAqnileta, and Tergeste, though a considerable mu­nicipal town, never ro>e iu ancient times to a com­manding position. We even learn that in the reignot Antoninus Pius the citizens obtained the admis-sion of the Carni and Catali—who had previouslybeen mere subjects or dependents—to the Roman"civitas," iu order that they might share the burthen-some honours of the local magistracy. (OrelI. /titer.4040.) The inscription from which we learn thisfact is one of the most interesting municipal recordspreserved to us from ancient times, and has l>ecurepeatedly published, especially with notes and il­lustrations by C. T. Zumpt (Decrehm Municipal*:Tergettimmn, 4to. Berol. 1837) and by Guttling(Fitnfzt hn Huinhche Vrhtmkn, p. 75). No subse­quent mention of Tergeste is found in history underthe Roman Empire; but it is certain that it conti­nued to exist; and retained its position as a consi­derable town throughout the middle ages. liut it isonly within the last century that it lias risen to theposition that it now occupies of one of the most po­pulous and flourishing cities on the Adriatic. Theonly remains of antiquity extant at Trieste are someportions of a Roman temple, built into the moderncathedral, together with several inscriptions (in­cluding the celebrated one already noticed) and sometragments of friezes, bas-reliefs, &c. lergeste is placed by the Itineraries at a distanceof 24 miles from AquileU, on the line of road whichfollowed the coast from that citv into lstria.

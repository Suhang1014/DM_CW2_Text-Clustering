In the cosmography of Aethicusthe Seqnana is named Geon or Geobonna, [G. L.]SE'QUANI (SijKovavo't), a Celtic nation in theup|«-r vallfy ot ibe Arir or Saotie. Luean {\. 425)follows the quantity of the Greek form: — u Optima gens flexis in pyrum Sequana fraen'is." Caesar fixes the position of the Seqnani. Tiieirterritory extended to the Rhine, (fi. G. i. 1.) TheJura .separated them on tiie east from the Helvetii;and the narrow puss between the Jura and 1 lieRhotM at Fort V Eel use was in the possession of theSequani (B. 0. i. C, 8). The southern boundary oftheir territory from Fort TEclusc was the Rhotw;but they did not possess all the country in the anplebetween the Rhone and the Sadne, for part of it washeld by the Allubropes (B. G. i. 12), and part bythe Sepusiani (B. G. i. 10) and by the Ainbarri,who were dependent on the Aedui (B. G. i. 11).When Caesar describes the march of the Helvetiifrom Fort C Ecluse to the Saotie, he says that theHelvetii first passed through the territory of theSequani, and then entered the territory of the Aedui,which tliey plundered. But they bad not yet reachedthe Sating asCasar's narrative shows, and it is clearfrom this passage G. i. 11) and those alreadycited, that a large tract of country between theRhone and tSaone did not belong to the Sequani, forthe line of march of the Helvetii from Fort CEcluseto the Saotie would probably bring them to the Saoneat a point not much lower down than Macon. Thewestern boundary of the Sequani was the Arar, alsocalled the Sauconna, a name which appears to bethe BftllK! as the name of the Sequani. Their neigh­bours on the west side of the&flOJM were the Aedui,with whom the Sequani had disputes about the rivertolls(Strab. iv. p. 192). On the north their neighbourswere the Leuci and Lingone*. Strabo (iv. p. 186)describes the Arar and Dubis (Jhntbs) as Mowingthrouph the country of the Sequani. IVAnville hasan argument to show that the jurt of the diocesesof Chdhn-.sur-Stwue and Macon which is east ofthe Snone belonged to the old territory of the Se­quani, which may be true; but the towns Matisco(Macon) and Cabillonuin (Chalon) were on thewest side of the Snone and in the territory of theAedui (B. G. vii. 90> In another ]ia.>sage besides that already referredto, Caesar ahowa that the Sequani extended to theBbine, lor in describing the course of this river fromsouth to north, lie says that it passes by the terri­tory of the Helvetii, Sequani, JMliomatrici andTribocci (B. G. iv. 10.) The Sequani belonged to the divi>ion of tlelcieaunder the Empire (Plin. iv. 17; Ptol. ii. 9. § 21).The territory of the Sequani contained much goudland, some of the best in Gallia. Their chief townwas Vesontio (Besancon) on the Doubs, and theybad otla?r towns also. They fed hogs, and theirhams and bacon were exported to Ittmc as Strabo(iv.p.192) say.-.;and Varro (*Ve R.R. ii. 4) may meanto say the same, when he ipeakl of Gallic bacon. The Sequani had kings, sometimes at least; furGallic kings were not perpetual. (B. G. i. 3.) lieforeCaesar went into Gallia, the Arverni and Aedui hadbf*en the two most powerful peoples. The Sequaniwere in league with the Arverni, who occupied thecentre of all Gallia, but hostile to tiieir neighboursthe Aedui To maintain themselves against the Aedui, the Arverni and Sequanicome over the Rhine.

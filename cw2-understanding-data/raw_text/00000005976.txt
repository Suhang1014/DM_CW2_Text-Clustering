"But the grammarian Apollonius relates that there was anearthquake during the reign of Tiberius Nero, through whichmany celebrated cities of Asia were entirely destroyed, but whichTiberius afterwards rebuilt at his own expence; for which bene­fit the Asiatics made a colossal statue of him, and placed it nearthe temple of Venus, which is in the forum of the Romans: andafter this, they placed the statues of the several cities that hadbeen rebuilt.

"Nor ought we to refuse our assent to this narration, since thereIs a place in Egypt called Litiæ, in which bodies are to be seen,not less in size than the above-mentioned, and these not buried in the

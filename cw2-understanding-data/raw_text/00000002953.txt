Now Antonius and Caesar had beaten Cassius near Philippi,as others have related; but after the victory, Caesar went intoGaul, [Italy] and Antony marched for Asia, who, when he wasarrived at Bythinia, he had ambassadors that met him from allparts. The principal men also of the Jews came thither, to ac­cuse Phasaelus, and Herod, and they said, that Hyrcanus had in­deed the appearance of reigning, but that these men had all thepower, but Antony paid great respect to Herod, who was cometo him to make his defence against his accusers, on which accounthis adversaries could not so much as obtain a hearing; whichfavour Herod had gained of Antony by money.

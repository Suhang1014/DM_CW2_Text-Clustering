He takes extraordi­nary pains to inveftigate the caufes of the fe-cond Punic war, and to determine which of thetwo nations had incurred the guilt of breach oftreaty. He difcufles th,e matter at confiderablelength*; ftating accurately, and carefully ex­amining, the facts and arguments urged onboth fides; and, at length, brings the matter tothis iflue, that, if the war is to be conlidered astaking its rile from the Heftruction of Sagun-tum, the Carthaginians were in the wrong;but by no means fo, if the matter be taken upfomewhat higher, and the taking of Sardiniaby the Romans, and the impofmg a tributeupon that ifland, be included in the account:for that, then, the Carthaginians did no morethan take occafion to avenge an injury donethem.

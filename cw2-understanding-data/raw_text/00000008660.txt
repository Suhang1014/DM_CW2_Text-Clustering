'lariauv?). a town inthe north of Euboea, situated upon the river C.iMas,at the foot of Mt, Telethrium, and opposite Antronen the Thessalian coast. From this town the wholenorthern extremity of Euboea was named Histiaeotis('l<TTiaiwTi$, Ion. 'liTTtaniTis, lleiud. vii. 23). Ac­cording to .some it was a colony from the Atticdemus of Histiaea (Strab. x. p. 445); according toothers it was founded by the Thes-sahan Perrhaebi.(Scyinn. Ch. 578.) It was one of the most ancientand most important of the Euboean cities. It oc­curs in Homer, who gives it the epithet uf tto\v-trratpuAos (//. ii. 5.'J7); and ScylaX mentions it asone of the four cities of Euboea (p. 22). After thebattle of ArtemUium, when the Grecian fleet sailedsouthwards, Histiaea was occupied by the Persians.(Herod, vii. 23.) Upon the expulsion of the Per­sians from Greece, Histiaea, with the other Kuboeantowns, became subject to Attica. In the revolt ofEuboea from Athens in B.C. 445, we may concludethat Histiaea took a prominent part, since Pericles,upon the reduction of the island, exj«*lled the inha­bitants from the city, and peopled it with 2001)Athenian colonists. The expelled Hi.stiaeans weresaid by Theopotnpos to have withdrawn to Mace­donia. (Thuc. i. 114: Diod. xii. 7, 22; Plut. Per.23; TheojM.mp. ap. Strab. x. p. 445.) From thistime we find the name of the town changed toOreus, which was originally a demus dependent uponHistiaea. (Strab. I. c; Pans, vii. 26. § 4.) It istrue tiiat Thueydides upon one occasion subseipi-'ntlycalls the town by its ancient name (vii. 57); but hespeaks of it as Oreus, in relating the .second revoltof Euboea in B.C. 411, where he says that it wasthe only town in the island that remained faithful toAthens. (Thuc. viii. 95.) At the end of the Pelo-ponnesian War, Oreus became subject to Sparta;the Athenian colonists were doubtless expelled, anda portion at least of its ancient inhabitants restored;and accordingly we read that this town remainedfaithful to Sparta and cherished a lasting hatredagainst Athens. (Diod. xv. 30.) Neogcnes, sup-|>orted by Jason of Pherac, made himself tyrant ofOreus for a time; but he was expelled by Therip-pidas, the Lacedaemonian commander; and theAthenian Chabrias endeavoured in vain to obtainpossession of the town. (Diod. /. <?.) But short I vafterwards, before the battle of Leuctra, Oreus re­volted from Sparta. (Xen. Hell v. 4. § 5G.) Iuthe subsequent war between Philip and the Athe­nians, a party in Oreus was friendly to Philip; andby the aid of this monarch Philistides became tyrantof the city (Dem. Phil, hi. pp. 119, 127, de Cor.p. 248; Strab. /. c); but the Athenians, at the in­stigation of Demosthenes, sent an expedition againstOreus, which expelled Philistides, and, according toCnarax, put him to death. (Dem. oV; Cor. p. 252:Charax, ap. Stepk. g. v. 'Clptos.) In consequence ofits geographical position and its fortifications, Oreusbecame an important place in the subsequent wars, jIn the contest between Antigonus and Cassander itwas besieged by the latter, who was, however, obligedto retire upon the approach of Ptolemj, the generalof Antigonus. (Diod. xix. 75, 77.) In the firstwar between the Koinans and Philip, it was betrayedto the former by the commander of the Macedoniangarrison, u. c. 207. (Lhr. xxviii. G.) Iu the^■cond war it was taken by the Romans by assault,u.c. 200. (Liv. xxxi. 46.) Soon afterwards, in B. c. 190, it was declared free by T.

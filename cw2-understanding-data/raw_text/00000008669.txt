S. j US'CANA, the chief town of the Penestae, a peo­ple of lllyricum. which contained 10.001 inhabitantsat the time of the Roman war with Perseus. At thecommencement of this war it appears to have been inthe hands of Perseus, and the first attempt of I heRoman commander, App. Claudius, to obtain pos­sesion of the place proved unsuccessful, B.C. 170.(I.iv. iliii. 10 ) It would seem, however, to havebeen afterwards taken by the Romans, since we readthat Perseus in the following year surprised Uscaua,marching thither in three days from Stubera. (Liv.xliii. 17, 18.) Shortly afterwards L. Coelius, theRoman commander in lllyricum, made an unsuccessfulattack upon Uscana. (lb. 21.) The site of thistown is uncertain.

Itsname is not found in the Itineraries, and the onlyauthor who mentions it is Ptolemy (iii. 3. § 2), whoerroneously places it ou the W. coast of the island:but the existing ruins, together with the name ofVstUat, still borne by a village on the site, leave nodoubt of its true situation. It is about 3 miles NE.of the modern town of A let. Ptolemy styles it acolonis, and this is confirmed by an inscription inwhich it bears the title of " Colonia Julia Augusta."It would hence appear probable that the colony musthave been founded under Augustus, though Plinytells us distinctly that Tunis Libyssonis was theonly colony existing in Sardinia in his time, (bela Marmora, 1'oy. en Sardaiyne, vol. ii. pp. 367,466.)

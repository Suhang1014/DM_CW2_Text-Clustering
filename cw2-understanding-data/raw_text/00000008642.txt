[E. B. J.]MASSYLL [Numidia.] MASTAURA (Mitrravpa). a town in the northof Caii*. at the foot of Mount Messogis, on thesmall river Chrysaoras, between Tralles and Tri­poli*. (Strab. xiv. p. 650; Plin. v. 31; Stcph. B.*. p.; HierocL p. 659.) The town was not of anygreat repute, but is interesting from its extantcoins, and from the fact that the ancient site is stillmarked by a village bearing the name Mastaura,near which a few ancient remains are found. (Ha­milton, Researches, i. p. 531.) [L. S.] MASTE (Moo-ni ipos, Ptol. iv. 7. § 26), a moun­tain farming part of the Abyssinian highlands,a little to the east of the Lunac Montcs, lat. 10° 59'N., long. 36° 55' E. The sources of the Astapus,Bahr-el-Atrek, Blue or Dark river, one of the ori­ginal tributaries of the Nile, if not the Nile itself, aresupposed to be on the N. side of Mount Maste.They are three springs, regarded as holy by thenatives, and though not broad are deep. Bruce,( Trued*, vol. iii. p. 308) visited Mount Maste, andwas the first European who had ascended it forseventy years. The tribes who dwelt near the foun­tains of the Bahr-el-Acrek were called Mastitae(MooTrrm, Ptol. iv. 5. § 24, 7. § 31), and there wasa town of the same name with the mountain (Mdarr)wiAis, PtoL iv. 7. § 25). [W. B. D.] MASTIA'NI (Mao-riayof), a people on the southroast of Spain, cast of the Pillars of Hercules, towhom the town of Mastia (Maori'a) belonged.They were mentioned by Hecataens (Steph. B. 8. v,Vlatmarvi) and Polybius (iii. 33), but do not oc­cur in later writers. Hannibal transported a part ofthem to Africa. (Polyb. I. c.) Mastia appears tobe the same as Massia (Maffffio), which Theopom-pas described as a district bordering upon theTartessians. (Steph. B. s. v. Mcurcrfa.) Hecataensalso assigned the following towns to this people:Maknoboka (Steph. B. ». r. Kcuv6Gwpa), pro­bably the same as the later Maenoba ; Slxus (2t(ur,S«eph. B. a. r.), probably the same as the later Sex,or Hexi; Molybdajia (MoAvSSdva, Steph. B.r. ».) : and Stalib (SvaAir, Steph. B. t. v.), pro­bably the later Suel. MASTRA'MELA (MaorpaM&n, Steph. B.«. v.),"» city and lake in Celtice," on the authority ofArtemidorus. This is the Astromela of the MSS.of Pliny [Fossa Mariana, p. 912]. The nameMartnunela also occurs in Avienus (Ora Marilima,v. 692). It is one of the lakes on the eastern sideof the Delta of the Rhone, but it is uncertain whichit ij. the E'tang de Bern or the E'tang de Mar-ti(p*ei. It is said that there is a dry port of someme in the middle of the E'Umg de Caronte, and thatthis dry part is still called Malestraou. [G.

(Plin.v.31.) [L. S.] MASCRA (MaVowpa), a place between Attalia and Perge in Pamphylia (Stadium. §§ 200, 201),and 70 stadia from Mygdala, which is probably acorruption of Magydus. [Magyuis.] [L. S.] MATALA PR. [Natalia.] MATA'LIA (MoToAla, rtol.iii. 17. § 4), a townin Crete near the headland of Matala (MaraAa,Stadiasm.), and probably the same place as thenaval arsenal of Gortyna, Metali.um (M«VaAAoi/,Strab. x. p. 479), as it appears in our copies ofStrabo, but incorrectly. (Comp. Groskurd, ad foe.)The modern name in Mr. Pashley's map is Matala.(Hock, Arete, vol. i. pp. 399,435;Mus. Class. Antiq.vol. ii. p. 287.) [E. B. .T.] MATEOLA, a town of Apulia, mentioned only byPliny (iii. 11. s. 16) among the inland cities of thatprovince. It is evidently the same now called Afa-tera about 12 miles from Ginosa (Genusium), and27 from the gulf of Tarentum. It is only about8 miles from the river Bradanus, and must there­fore have been closely adjoining the frontier ofLucania. [E. H. B.] MATAVO, or MATAVONIUM, as D'Anvillehas it, in Gallia Narbonensis, is placed by theAntonine Itin. on a road from Forum Voconii [Fo-kum Voconti] to Massilia (Marseille), 12 M. P.from Forum Voconii and 14 from Ad Turres(Tourres), between which places it lies. It is alsoin the Table, but the distances are not the same.Matavo is supposed to be Vms. [G. L.] MATERENSE OPPIDUM, one of the thirty freetowns (" oppida libera," Plin. v. 4) of Zeugitana. Itstill retains the ancient name, and is the modemMatter in the government of Tunis,— a small vil­lage situated on a rising ground in the middle of afruitful plain, with a rivnlet a little below, whichempties itself into the Sisura Palus.

Ma-nai'o'r,Mannvo's), a district of ancient Media, in thesouth-western part of its great subdivision calledMedia Atropatene, extending along the mountainswhich separate Armenia and Assyria. Its bound­aries are very uncertain, and it is not possible todetermine how far it extended. It is probablythe same as the MapTiaWj of Ptolemy (vi. 2.§ 5). [Martiane.] Strabo mentions as a pe­culiarity of the trees in this district, that theydistil honey (I. c). The Matiani are included byHerodotus in the eighteenth satrapy of Dareius(iii. 94), and served in the army of Xerxes, beingarmed and equipped in the same manner as thePaphlagonians (vii. 72). Herodntus evidently con­sidered them to occupy part of the more widelyextended territory of Armenia, [V.] MATIE'NI MONTES (to: Manrjro o>n, Herod,i. 1S9. 202, v. 52), the ridge of mountains whichforms the back-bone or centre of Matiana, doubtlesspart of the mountain range of Kurdistan, in theneighbourhood of Vtfn.

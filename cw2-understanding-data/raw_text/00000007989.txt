THRACIA. a powerful force in Thrace, the Paeonians couldhardly have succeeded in making their escape fromPhrygia back to the Strymon (Id. v. 98), nor couldthe revolted lonians (b. c. 498) have taken Byzan­tium and all the other cities in that country. (Id.v. 103.) It is to this period that we must refer theinvasion of the Scythians, who are said to have ad­vanced as far as the Chersonesus, thus occasioningthe temporary flight of Miltiades, who, they wereaware, had assisted Darius in his attack upon theircountry. (Id. vi. 40.) After the suppression of the Ionian revolt (d. c.493), the Phoenician fleet sailed to the Hellespont,and again brought the country under the Persiandominion, Cardiu being the only city which theywere unable to take. (Id. vi. 33.) Miltiades madebis escape from the Chersonesus to Athens, on hear­ing of the approach of the hostile fleet. (76. 41.) Next year Mardonius led an army across theHellespont, and advanced as far as Macedonia ; buthis fleet having been wrecked off Mount Athos, andhis land forces having suffered considerably in a warwith the Thracians, who then occupied the countryW. of the Strymon, he retraced his steps, and trans­ported his shattered army into Asia (Id. vi. 43, seqq.). It was not till ii. c. 480 that the vast army underthe command of Xerxes crossed the Hellespont bythe famous bridges which spanned the strait fromAbydos to Septus. Of his march through Thrace,Herodotus gives an interesting account (vii. 10$—115); hut, as he met with no opposition, we need notdwell upon these circumstances. Atter the disastrous battle of Salamis, Xerxes,with an escort <<f 60,000 men, hastened back by thesame road which he had so recently trod in all theoverweening confidence of despotic power: in Thrace,his miserable troops suffered greatly from hungerand consequent disease, but do not appear to havebeen openly attacked. (Herod, vhi. 115, seqq.) Next year (b. c. 479) was fought the battle ofPlataeae in which Thracians formed part of themotley host arrayed against Greek freedom (Id. ix.32). Artabazus led the 40,000 men, who aloneremained of the Persian army, by forced marchesthrough Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace. He struckthrough tlie interior of the latter country, probablyfor tear of the Greek cities on the coast; but he en­countered enemies as much to be dreaded, and lost agreat part of his army by hunger, fatigue, and the at­tacks of the Thracians, before he reached Byzantium. It was now the turn of the victorious Greeks toassail their foes in their own territories. Thrace,with the exception of Doriscus, was soon cleared ofthe Persians. After the battle of Mycale, their fleetsailed to the Hellespont, where the Athenians laidsiege to Scstns, which was taken early in the followingyear (b. c. 478) [Sestcs]. Eion, at the mouthof the Strymon, made a desperate resistance ; but atlength (u. c. 470) fell into the hands of Cimon andthe Athenians, after its Persian governor had put todeath all his family, and finally himself. (Herod,vii. 107; cf. Thucyd. i. 98). Byzantium had beentaken by Pausanias the year before. Thus the Per­sians were driven out of Europe, and the Greeksettlements in Thrace resumed their internal freedomof action, though most of them, it is probable, weremuter the supremacy of Athens, as the chosen headof the great Greek confederacy. During the administration of Pericles, 1000 Athe­nian citizens were settled in the Tliracian Cher­sonesus, which was always the chief stronghold of Athens in that quarter.

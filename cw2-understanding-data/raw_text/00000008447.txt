VOMANUS ( Votnano), a river of Picennm, whichrues in the lofty group of the Apennines now knownas the Gran Satto dltalia, and flows into theAdriatic, after pausing within a few miles to the N.of the city of Adria (/l(n'). Its name is mentionedby Pliny only (iii. 13. § 18). [E. H. B.J VORDENSES, in Gallia Narbonensia, an ethnicname which occurs in an inscription found at Apt,the aileof Apta Julia [Aita Julia]. The in­scription states that the " Vordenses pagani" de­dicate this monument to their patronus, who isdesignated "imvir" of the Colonia Apta. Theplace is supposed to be Gordet, which is contiguousto the diocese of Apt, and in that of Cavaillon. Thechange of Vord into Gonl is easily explained. [Va-riNCDM.] (D'Anville Notice, dr ) [G. L.] VOKEDA, a town of the Brigantes in BritanniaRomana, on the road from Cataracton to Lugu-Talliuin. (ltin. Ant. p. 4f>7.) It is variously iden­tified with Old Penrith, Whelp Cattle, and Coal/Hilt. By the Geogr. Bat. (r. 31) it is calledBemU. [T. H. D.] VORGA'XIUM (Ouopyinor), in Gallia Lugdu-nensis, the capital of the Osismii [Osismii]. aCeltic people in the north-west part of liretagne(PtoL ii. 8. § 5). This seems to be the sameplace as the Vorginum of the Table; and it appearson a route which leads from the capital of theXainnetes through the capital of the Veneti, andends on the coast at Gesocribate, or Gesobrirate, assome would write it. Between the capital of theVeneti and Vorginum is Sulis, supposed to be at thejunction of the Suel and the Biuret [Si'Lia],From Sulis to Vorginum the distance is markedxxiiiL, and this brings us to a place namedKarhex (D'Anville). But all this is very un-cvrlain. Others fix Vorginum at a place namedCuemeni [G. L.] VOKO'GIUM, in Gallia, is placed in the table ona road from Augustonemetum (Clermont Ferrand)through Aquae Calidae (Vichy) to Ariolica (yicrtT/i).The distance is marked viii. from Aquae Caliilae,and xiiii. from Vorogium to Ariolica. There is Aplace named Vouroux, which is the same name asVurngium. Vouroux is near the small town ofI'arennet. and somewhat nearer to the banks of theAllier. The direct distance from the springs ofI'tcAy to Varennet is soniewhat less than the ltin.diKtmnce of viii. Gallic leagues, but the 8 leagues arenot more than we may assign to the distance fromVichy to Varennet along the river. But the ltin.distance from Vorogium to Ariolica is soniewhat toolarge compared with the real distance. (D'Anville,Notice. frc.) [G.L.]VOSAMA. [Vosata.]VOSAVA or VOSAVIA, in North Gallia, isplaced by the Table on the Roman mad Along thewest bank of the Rhine, and between Bontobrice orBaudobricA (Iiuppart) [Bai'DOBRIca] and Bin-piura (Bingen) It stands half-way between theseplaces and at the distance of viiii. Vosava is Ober-vretel on the Rhine, north of Bingtn; and it isavlmost certain, as D'Anville suggests, that the nameis erroneously written iu the Table, and that itabouM be Vosalia. [G.I..] VCSEGUS (Vogeten, Vatgau, Vosges). Theform Vosegus has better authority than Vogeans(Schneider's Cottar, B. G. iv. 10) ; and the modernname also is in favour of the fonn Vosegus. Lucanis sometimes quoted as Authority fur the formVogesos: "Castraqne quae Vogesi curram super ardua rupemPugnaces pictis cohibebant Lingonas armis." (Phartal i. 397.)The name is Boo-^kof in the Greek version of theCommentaries. Caesar says that the Mosa (ifaai) rises in theVosegus, by which he means that the hills in whichthe Moot rises belong to the Votget. But be saysno more of this range. The battle with Ariovistua,B. c. 58. was fought between the southern extremityof the Votget and the Rhine, but Caesar (B. G.i. 43. 48) gives no name to the range under whichAriovistua encamped in the great plain between theVoiget and the Rhine. D'Anville observes thatan inscription in honour of the god Vosegus waifound at Berg-Zabern on the confines of Alsace Andthe Palatinate, which proves that the name Vosegusextended as far as that place. It seems likely thatthe name was given to the whole range now calledVotget, which may he considered as extending fromthe depression in which is formed the canal of theRhone and Rhine, between Bifort and Altkirch,to the bend of the Mine between Haitu andBingen, a distance of above 170 miles. The rangeof the Votget is pArallel to the Rhine. The hillycountry of the Faucillet in which the Maat risesis west of the range to which the name of Votgetis now given. The Votget are partly in France,and partly in Rhenish Bavaria and llette Darm-ttadt. The territory of the Seqnani originally extendedto the Rhine, ami the southern part of the Votgetwas therefore included in their limits. North ot theSeqnani and west of the Votget were the Leuci andMcdiomatrici; and east of the Votget and betweenthe Votget and the Rhine were the Rauraci, Triboci,Nemetes, Vangiones, and Caracates. In the Table the Silva Vosagns is marked as along forest on the west side of the Rhine. Pliny(xvi. 39) also speaks of the range of the Vosegusas containing timber. [G. I..] UR. a castle of the Persians mentioned by Ammi-anus Marcellinus (xxv. 8), in his account of the warbetween Julian and the Persians. It must havebeen situated in Mesopotamia, at no great distancefrom Iiatra (Al-llathr). It has been generallysupposed that Ur is the same place as that men­tioned in Genesis (xi. 28); but the recent researchesof Colonel Bawlinson have demonstrate*) that the Urwhence Abraham started was situated in the S. partof Babylonia, at a place now called MMother.(Joum. Roy. At. Soc. 1855.) [V.] URAXOTOMS (OopwoiroXii), a town in thepeninsula Acte of Chalcidice in Macedonia, of whichwe know nothing, except that it was founded by Alex-archus, the brother of Cassander, king of Macedonia(Athen. iii. p. 98; Plin. iv. 10. s. 17). As Plinydoes not mention Sane in his list of the towns ofActe, it has been conjectured by Leake that Urano.polis occupied the site of Sane. (Northern Greece,roL in. p. 149.) URANO'POLIS (OtoorowoXir). a town of Pi-sidia, in the district of Cabalia, to the north-west ofTermessus, and south-east of Isionda. (I'tol. v. 5.§ 6.) [L. 8.] URBA, a town of Gallia, in the territory of tbsHelvetii. It is placed in the Antonine ltin. be­tween Lacus Lausonius and Ariolica [Abiouca],xviii. from Lacus LAusonius and xxiiii. from Ario­lica.

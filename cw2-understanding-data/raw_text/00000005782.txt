The historian,Pancirollus, who mentions this lamp, is a respectable author, andrelates it as a well-known fact, in his curious book, entitled, Con­cerning memorable Things known to the Antients, but now-lost. Saint Austin too (De Civitat. Dei, I.21. cap. 6.) fays, thata lamp was found in a temple dedicated to Venus, which wasalways exposed to the open weather, and could never be con­sumed, or extinguished.

A very remarkable lamp was discovered about the year 1500,near Atestes, a town belonging to Padua in Italy, by a rustic,who digging deeper than usual, sound an earthen urn, contain­ing another urn, in which last was a lamp placed between twocylindrical vessels, one of gold, and the other of silver, and eachof which was full of a very pure liquor, by whose virtue, it isprobable, the lamp had continued to (hine for upwards of 1500years; and, unless it had been exposed to the air, might havecontinued its wonderful light for a still greater period of time.This curious lamp was the workmanship of one Maximus Oly-bius, who most probably effected this wonder by a profoundskill in the chymical art. On the greater urn some verses wereinscribed in Latin, which may be translated as follows: I. Plund'rers, forbear this gift to touch, 'Tis awful Pluto's own:A secret rare the world conceals, To such as you unknown. II. Olybius in this slender vase The elements has chain'd;Digested with laborious art, From secret science gain'd. III. With

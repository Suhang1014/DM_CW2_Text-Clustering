After its capture by Snladin(Wilken, Die Kretaz, vol. iv. pp. 537,539) it fellinto the hands of onr own Richard (p. 545), wasthen sacked by Malek-al-Adcl (vol, v. p. 25). wasrebuilt by Frederick II. (vol. vi. p. 471) andLocis IX. (vol. vii. p. 316), when it was taken bySultan Bibars (vol. vii. p. 517). As the landing-place for pilgrims to Jeru-alem, from the first Cru-tade to onr own day, it occurs in all the Itinerariesand books of travels, which describe the locality andnatural unfitness of Jaffa for a haven, in terms veryrimilar to those employed by the ancients.

(Roland, Pa-laest. p. 864; Von Kaumer, Palestina. p. 201;AViner, Realtcorterbuch, s. v.; Robinson, Researches,voL iii. p. 31; Kilter, Erdbmde, vol. xvi. pt. i.pp. 574—580, Berlin, 1852.) [E. B. J.] JORDANES. [Palaestina.] IOS ("los: Eth. 'Ittttji, 'I«T7|t), an island in theAegaean sea, one of the Sporados, and falsely called byStephanus one of the Cyclades, lay north of Theraand south of Paros and Naxos. According to Pliny,it was 25 miles in length, and was distant 18 milesfrom Naxos and 25 from Thera. (Plin. iv. 12. s. 23.)Both Pliny and Stephanus state that it was ori­ginally called Phoenice. It possessed a town of thesame name (Ptol. iii. 15. § 28), situated upon aheight on the western side of the island. It has anexce lent harbour, of a circular form, like the Pei-raeeus: its mouth faces the south-west, and is op.pnMte the island of Sicinus. The island is nowrailed Sio (iv "Iy); and when Ross visited it, in1836, it contained 505 families or 2500 souls. Themodern town is built upon the site of the ancientone, of which there are still remains. los was celebrated in antiquity as the burial-place of Homer, who is said to have died here on hisvovage from Smyrna to Athens. Long afterwards,when the fame of the poet had filled the world, theinhabitants of los are reported to have erected thefollowing inscription upon his tomb 'Zi&a&* t$iv itphv Kctpa\i]v Kara ycua Ka\virrci'Arip£/t ripwvy Koff^ropa, Stlov 'Opnpcv. (Pseudo-Herod. Fit Vomer. 34, 36; comp. Seylax,p. 22; Slrab. x. p. 484; Paus. x. 24. § 2; Plin.,Meph. U. cc.) It was also stated that Clymene,the mother of Homer, was a native of los, and thatshe was buried iu the island (Paus., Steph. B., U.cc);and, according to Gellius (iii. 11), Aristotle relatedthat Homer himself was bom in los. In 1771 aDutch nobleman, Graf Pasch van Krienen, assertedthat be had discovered the tomb of Homer in then-.Tthem part of the island; and in 1773 he pub­lished an account of his discovery, with some in­scriptions relating to Homer which ho said he hadfound upon the tomb. Of this discovery a detailed COIN OF IOS. account is given by Ross, who is disposed to believethe account of Pasch van Krienen; but the originalinscriptions have never been produced, and mostmodern scholars regard them as forgeries.

JOTABE ('ItoTaS7)), an island in the ErythraeanSea, not less than 1000 stadia from the city ofAelana, inhabited by Jews who, formerly inde­pendent, accepted the yoke of the Empire duringthe reign of Justinian (Procop. B. P. i. 19). It isnow called Tiran, or Djeziret Tyran of Burkhardt(Trav. p. 531), the island at the entrance of theGulfof Ahibah. (Comp. Journ. of Geog. Soc. vol.vi. pp. 54, 55.) The modern name recalls the"Gens Tyra" of Pliny (vi. 33), placed by him inthe interior of the Arabian gulf. (Ritter, Erd-hmde, vol. xiii. pp. 223—225, vol. xiv. pp. 19,262.) [E. B. J.] JOTA'PATA (WdWa: Eth. 'IairajraTiji'o's,Steph. B. *. r.), a city of Galilee, standing on thesummit of a lofty hill, rising abruptly on three sides,from the deep and impassable ravines which sur­rounded it. Josephus, who manfully defended itagainst Vespasian, has told the story of its siege andcapture : 1200 prisoners were taken, and 40,000 menfell by the sword during its protracted siege: Ves­pasian gave orders that the city should be razidto the ground, and all the defences burnt. Thusperished Jotnpata on the first day of Panemus(July) (B.J. iii. pp. 6—8; comp. Reland, Palnest.p. 867; Milman, Hist, of Jews, vol. ii. pp.287—309). Mr. Bankcs (lrby and Mangles, Trav.p. 299) has fixed the site at the singular remains ofKiiTat Ilm Mu'an, in the Wady-el-Ham&m (comp.Burkhardt, Trae. p. 331; Ritter, Erdhmde, vol.xv. pt i. p. 327), but Robinson (Researches, vol. iii.pp. 279—282) identifies these ruins with the Ar-bela of Galilee and its fortified caverns. [E. B. J.]JO'TAPE (Torrdirj): Eth. 'UiTBTelrns), a smalltown of Cilicia, in the district called Selenitis, notfar from Selinus. It is perhaps the same place asLaertc, the native city of Diogenes Laertius. It isidentified with the modern fort iMmbardo. (Ptol. v.8. § 2; Plin.v. 22-, Concil. Chalced. p. 659; Hierocl.p. 709, where it is called 'lordmt; comp. Laf.rtk.)The coins of Iotape belong to the emperors Philipand Valerian. [L. S-] JOVA'LIA, a town of Lower Pannonia, on thesouthern bank of the river Dravus. (Itin. Uieros.p. 562.) In the Peut. Tab. it is called Iovallium,while Ptolemy (ii. 16. § 6.) calls it 'loioWov or'IooSoAoy, and the Geog. Rav. (iv. 19), Ioballios. Itoccupied, in all probability, the site of the modernvillage of Valpo. [L. S.] JQVEM, AD, in Gallia Aquitania, a Mutatio onthe road from Burdigala (Bordeaux) to Tolosa(Toulouse'); and between Bucconis andTolo*a. ThisMutatio was seven leagues from Tolosa. D'Anvilleconjectures it to be at a place which he namesGuevin or Guerin. Wnlckenaer fixes the Mutatioof Bucconis near the Bois du Bouconne. [G. I..]JOTIA, a town in Lower Pannonia, south of theriver Dravus, on the road from Poetovium to Mursa.(Itin. Uieros. p. 561; Itin. Ant. p. 130; Tab. Peut.)The site is generally identified with some ruins foundat Toplita. Another place of the same name iamentioned in Upper Pannonia, on the same road(Itin. .4nf. p.264), and is identified with some ruinsfound at Iovinax. [L. S.]

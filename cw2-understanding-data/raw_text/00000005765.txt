OCR Output OF GREECE. 175 Lescheus relates in his verses, that when Troy wastaken, Æthra escaped, and came to the camps of theGreeks; that she was there known by the sons of Theseus,and that Demophon requested her in marriage 9s Aga­memnon. That he indeed was willing to gratify Demophon,but that he said he would not accomplish their desires, tillhe had gained the consent of Helen. A herald thereforebeing sent to Helen, found her disposed to the match.Hence, in the picture, Eurybates appears addressing Helenon account of Æthra, and delivering to her the messageof Agamemnon. Trojan women too are represented inthis picture in the habit of mourning captives. The firstof these is Andromache with an infant at her breast.Lescheus fays, that this infant was thrown from a tower,not indeed by the decree of the Greeks, but through theprivate hatred of Neoptolemus, who ordered him to beput to death. Medesicaste likewise is painted here, whowas one of the bastard daughters of Priam, who, accord­ing to Homer, dwelt in the city Pedæum, and was mar­ried to Imbrius the son of Mentor. Andromache andMedesicaste are veiled: but Polyxena is painted with herhair platted after the manner of virgins. Poets sing, andthe pictures which I have seen at Athens, and Pergamuswhich is a city above Cakus, in which die calamities ofPolyxena are painted, evince, that she was slain at thetomb of Achilles. Polygnotus too has painted in thefame picture, Nestor with a hat on his he.id, and a spearin his hand. A 'horse rolling in the dust is seen nearhim. The ground on which the horse lies is the sea shore jand the pebbles on the sliore are represented. The re­maining part of the ground does not appear to resemblethe sea shore. , CHAP.

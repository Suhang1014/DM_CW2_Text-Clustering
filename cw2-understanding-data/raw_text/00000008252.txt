The Tentyrite Athor has ahuman face with the ears of a cow (Rosellini,Monum. dA. Culto, pi. 2\t. 3), and her attributes soclosely resemble those of Isis, that it was longdoubtful to which of the two goddesses the greattemple at Tentyra was dedicated. Like [sis, Athoris delineated nursing a young child named Ehoott,said, in hieroglyphics, to he her son. He is thethird member of the Tentyrite triad of deities. The principal fabrics and produce of Tentyrawere flax and linen. (Pliu. xix. 1.) Its inhabit­ants held lite crocodile in abhorrence, and engagedin sanguinary conflicts with its worshippers, espe­cially with those of the Ombite Nome [Umbos].Juvenal appears to have witnessed one ot these com­bats, in which the Ombites had the worst of it, andone of them, falling in his flight, was torn to piecesand devoured by the Tentyriles. Juvenal, indeed,describes this tight as between the inhabitants ofcontiguous nomes ("inter finitimos"); but this isincorrect, since Umbos and Tentyra are more than 50miles apart. As, however,Coptosand Tentyra werenearly opposite to each oilier, and the crocodile wasworshipped by the Coptites also, we should probablyread Coptos tor Umbos in Juvenal. {Sot. xv.) Thelatter were so expert in the chase of this animal init;, native element, that they were wont to follow itinto the Nile, and drag it to shore. (Aelian, Bust.Anini. x. 24; l'lhi. viii. 25. s. 38.) Seneca (Aut.Qwitsl. it. 2) says that it was their presence of mindthat gave the Tentyrites the advantage over the cro­codile, for the men themselves were small sinewyfellows. Strabo (xvii. pp. 814, 815) saw at Humethe exhibition of a combat between the crocodile andmen purposely imported from Tentyra. They plungedboldly into the tanks, and, entangling the crocodiles illnets, haled thein backwards and forwards in and outof the water, to the gieat amazement, of the be­holders. So long as Aegypt was comparatively unexplored,no ruins attracted inure admiration from travellersthan those of Tentyra. They are the first intolerable preservation and of conspicuous magnitudethat meet the eyes of those who ascend the Nile.They are remote from the highways anil habitationsof men, standing at the hurt of the Libyan bills,amid the sands of the western desert. But thoughlong regarded as works uf a remote era, Aegyptianart was already on the decline when the temples ofTentyra were erected. The architecture, indeed,reflects the grandeur of earlier periods; but thesculptures are ungraceful, and the hieroglyphics un­skilfully crowded ujwiii its monuments. The mustancient of the inscriptions do not go farther backthan the reigns of the later Ptolemies; but thenames of the Caesars, from Tiberius to AntoninusMi us (a. i). 14—161), are of frequent occurrence.Tentyra, in common with Upper Aegypt generally,appears to have profited by the peace and security itenjoyed under the imperial government to enlarge orrestore its monuments, which, since the Persian oc­cupation of the country, had mostly fallen into de­lay. 'The principal structures at Tentyra are thegreat temple dedicated to Athor; a temple of Isis;a Typhonium; and an isolated building without aroof, of which the object has not been discovered.With the exception of the latter, these structures areinclosed by a crude brick wall, forming a square,each side of which occupies lUOU feet, and which is I in some parts 35 feet hieh and 15 feet thick.

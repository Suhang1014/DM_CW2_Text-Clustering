Hence their opinion, whoassert that the Cadmus who came to Thebes was auEgyptian, and not a Phœnician, may be confuted by thevery name given to this statue of Minerva: for this god­dess is called Siga in the Phœnician, and not Sais, as in.the Egyptian tongue. The Thebans too farther report, that where the forumof the tower now stands, the house of Cadmus formerlystood. Hence, they shew the ruins of the bed-chambersof Harmonia and Semele, into which last, even at present,men are not permitted to enter. According to the Greeks,the Muses celebrated the nuptials of Harmonia with songs:and there is a place in the forum here, where they fay thegoddesses fang. It is also said, that together with thethunder which descended into the chamber of Semele, apiece of wood fell from heaven, which Polydorus adornedwith brass, and called Cadmean Bacchus. Near this thereis a statue of Bacchus, which Onassimedes made entirelyof brass; for the statue of Cadmus was made by the sonsof Praxiteles. Here too there is a statue of Pronomus thepiper, who allured many by his harmony. Before histime there were different pipes, for the Dorian, Lydian,and Phrygian measures; but he sirjl invented pipes adapted toevery kind of harmony, and was the first that played all thedifferent measures at once on one pipe. It is alto said, that hewonderfully delighted the spectators in the theatres, bythe gesticulations of his face, and the motion of his wholebody. His songs are yet extant which he composed forthe Chalcidenses by the Euripus, in honour of Delos. TheThebans therefore have here placed a statue of this Pro-pomus, and of Epaminondas the son of Polymnis. CHAP.

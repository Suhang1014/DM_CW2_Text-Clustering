TheSotiates were the neighbours of the Elusates aname represented by t lie town of JCause. A linedrawn from Auck (Ausei) on the Gers to Bazas intlie department of La Gironde, passes near Sos, atown which is on the Getiie, and in the Gabaret.In the middle ages it was called Solium. Ancientremains have been found at Sos. Here we have aninstance of the preservation of ancient names in thispart of France, and tin-re are many oiher instances. D'Anville in tfeteriniuine; the position of tlie Satiatesargues correctly that Crassus having passed throughthe Santones. a people who hail submitted to Caesar{ft. G. iii. 12) and would offer no resistance, enteredAqtiitania by the north, and the Sotiates who wereonlv seven or eight leagues south of the Garonnewould be the first tribe on whom befell. Ho saysthat he has evidence of a Roman road very directfrom Sos to Eause ; and he is convinced that this ispart of the road drscribed in the Jerusalem Itin. be­tween Vasatae and Klusa. On this road the name Scit-tium occurs in the Ttin., ami as the distance betweenScittiurn and Elu^a correspnnds very nearly to thedistance between Sos and tiause, he conjectures thatthis word Scittiutn is written wrong, and that itshould be Solium. The Sotiates, who were strong in cavalry, attackedthe Romans on their march, and a battle took placein which they were defeated. Crassus then assaultedtheir town, which made a stout resistance. Hebrought up his vineae and towers to the walls, butthe Sotiates drove mines under them, for as theyhad copper mines in their country they were veryskilful in burrowing in the ground. At last theysent to Crassus to proj>ose terms of surrender (B. G.iii. 21). While the people were giving up their arms(.n one side of the town, Adcantuannus, who wa.; aking or chief, attempted to sally out on another sidewith his GOO " soldurii." The Romans met himthere, and after a hard fight Adcantuannus wasdriven back into the town; but ho still obtained thesame easy terms as the rest. These Soldurii were a body of men who attachedthemselves to a chief with whom they enjoyed all(he good things without working, so long as thechief lived; but if any violence took off their leaderil was their duty to share the same fate or to die bytheir own hand. This was an Iberian and also aGallic fashion. The tiling is easily understood.A usurper or any desperate fellow seized on powerwitli the help of others like himself; lived well, andfed his friends; anil when his tyranny came to anend, he and all his crew must kill themselves, ifthey wished to escape the punishment which theydeserved. (Plut. Sertor. c. 14; Caesar, H. G. vi'i,40; and the passage in Athenaeus.) The MSS. of Caesar vary in the name of Adcan­tuannus. Schneider writes it Adiatunus, and inAthenaeus it is 'ASi^TOnoy. Schneider mentions amedal of Pellerin, with REX AALETVfiNY'2 anda lion's head on one side, and on the other SO-TIOGA. Walekenaer (Geogr. <)'"<"• i. 284) may bespeaking of the same medal, when he describes onewhich is said to have been found at, 'Jouluttjte, witha head of Adictanus on one side and the w«>nlSotiagae on the other.

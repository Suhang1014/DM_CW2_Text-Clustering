Admitting Plutarch's accountlit'the triumphs nf Paullus and Lucullus, namely,tliat they passed through the Circus Flaminios, yetwhat does this prove? how is it connected with thePorta Triumphalis? Those generals may havemarshalled their processions in the Campus andpassed through the Circus Flaminins in their wayto the Porta Triumphalis. The precession wouldhave Wen equally visible in the Circus as in thestreets of Home, just as the Lord Mayor's show may,or might, be seen at Westminster as well as in thecitv. It is pissible indeed that in the case of Ves­pasian there was no procession till he arrived at thegate; but it does nut necessarily follow that thesame line was always precisely observed. In truthwe may perceive a difference between the expressionsof Josepluw and those of Plutarch. The formersavs that Vespasian went Sia twc Hfdrpuy; whilstPlutarch says, of Paullus, that the people assemblediv rois twitika is dfaTO'H*, 6\ KtpKovs Kahovatv;of Lucullus, that he adorned tof 'PXafiiffiov i'tttto-Sftofiov. lien* the cirri are precisely designated ashipp'xlromes; but Josephus uses the general term^aTpiur. which may include theatres of all kinds.Xow we will suggest a mure probable route thanthat given by Becker, according to which the pa­geant must have crossed the forum twice. Aftercoming out at the further end nf the circus, Ves­pasian turned down to the left, between the Palatineand Caelian, the modern Via dt S. Grtgorio. Thiswonld bring him out opposite his own magnificentamphitheatre, the Colosseum, then in course of con-struclion. Even if it had not risen much above itsfoundations, still its ample area by means of scaffold­ings, would have accommodated a vast number nfspectators; and as to Vespasian personally, it wouldhave imparled no small rciish to his triumph topa-s thruugh so magnificent a work of his owncreation. Hence his road lay plain and direct overthf Sumina Sacra Via to the f>rum and Capitol. Xow, taking all thesp things into consideration,we will venture to suggest a very slight change in1 lie te\t ot Josephus, a change not so great as someof those often proposed by Becker upon muchsmaller occasions, and which will release us from agreat deal of perplexity. The alteration is that ofan N into a n. a very slight one in the uncial cha­racter; and, by reading drex^pei for ew€Xwp*t, wewould make Vespasian depart from the PorticosOctaviae towards the gate which had always beenu-ed fa- triumphs, instead of retracing It is stepstowards one of which nobrx.lv can give any account.But whatever may be thought of the individualcase of Ve-pasian, still we hold it to be incontestablethat tin- ancient Porta Triumphalis, against whichthe sole objection seems to be that it was near twoother gates, i-, t>> be sought in that part of theServian wall between the P. Carmentalis and the1*. Flumentana. The objection just alluded to wouldindeed have some force, if we could assume, withBecker (Handb. p. 154), that the Porta Triumphalis,just like an ordinary one, lav always open for com­mon traffic. But it is surprising how anvbodv couldcome to that conclusion utter reading the passageswhich Becker has himself cited from Suetonius,Tacitus, and Dion Cassius, or that in Cicero's ora­tion against Piso before quoted. The first of theseauthors relates that after the death of Augustus the senate voted, or pmpneed to vtfe, that.a» oextraordinary mark of honour, his ftiflTilpass through the triumphal gate. frw"i«i &statue of Victory which stood in the curia: "Itcensuerint quidam funus triumphal! porta don aim.| praecedente Victoria, quae est in Cora" (J*i 100; cf.

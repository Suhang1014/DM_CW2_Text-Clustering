But he thinks thatthe Maritima Colonia of Ptolemy is a differentplace from the Maritima Avaticorum of Pliny; andhe says that the measures of Ptolemy for MaritimaColonia fix the Anatili, whose capital this town was,between the mouths of the Rhone. Pliny also speakscf the Anatili (iii. 4), and Walckenaer says that heplaces them where Ptolemy does, or rather where heMy* that Ptolemy places them. But this is not so.Pliny places them east of the eastern branch of theRhone, if his text can be understood. Nor is it truethat Ptolemy places the Anatili or Avatici, what­ever may be the true name in his text, between themouths of the Rhone; for Ptolemy places them eastof the eastern branch of the Rhone, where Plinyplaces the Avatici. Walckenaer can find no place forPtolemy's Maritima Colonia, except by hazarding apoem that it may have been Heraclea [Heraclka]at the mouth of the Rhone; but Ptolemy places theilaritima Colonia half a degree east of the easternmouth of the Rhone. Walekenaer's examination ofthis question is very badly done. The site ofMaritima at Samt-Blaite seems probable, for it iscertain that a Roman town was there. Many re­mains, Roman bricks, and coins have been found atSamt-Blaite; and " there are wharves on which thereare still iron rings to fasten ships by " (Ukert, Gal-Hen, p. 421). Ukert's authority seems to be theStatistupte du Depart, det BoucJtet-du-Rhone; butoce ian hardly suppose that any man can believethat iron rings exposed to the weather could last■a long. [G.

The psition of Tabilba. where thereare ruins, and inscriptions in the running hand of theGreeks of the Roman Empire, corresponds exactlywith these naval stations. (Beechey, Expedition totkt X.

Iteoouined a sanctuary of all the gods and one ofArtemis, and in each there were copions springs of«ster. It is represented by Mari, which stands onthe road from Gherdki (Geronthrae) over the moun­tains to Krematti; but, according to the FrenchC-xntnissioo, its real distance from Geronthrae is from7 > to 80 stadia, and not 100, as is stated by Pau-uaiaj. There are ruins of the ancient town abouta mile and a half to the south of the modern village,nil the place is still characterised by its abundantfflLtiita, (Pans. iii. 21. §7,22. §8; Boblaye,Aedin-cAea, <fc. p. 96; Leake, Pelopomtetiaca,f- 3*2; Curtius, Peloponneiot, vol. ii. p. 303.)

The Marmakidak (o! MapfiaplSai),a Libyan tribe, gave their name, which Niebuhr(iact on Anc. Ethnog. and Geog. vol. ii. p. 336) derives from the word "Mar" = salt, with a re­duplication common to these languages, to theregion they occupied. They appear as the principalindigenous tribe to the W. of Aegypt, between theage of Philip of Macedon, and the third century ofthe Christian aera (Scylax, c. 107, ed. Klausen;Strab. ii. p. 131, xvii. pp. 798, 825, 838 ; Plin.v. 5; Joseph. B. J. ii. 16. § 4; Vopisc. Vit. Prob.c. 9), but are not mentioned by Herodotus; it isprobable that they were pushed into the interior ofthe country, by the Greek colonists of Cyrene, andafterwards recovered their ancient seats. In thereign of Magas of Cyrene, the Marmaridae revolted,and compelled that prince to give up his intention ofattacking Ptolemy Philadelphia, and the Aegyptianfrontier. (Paus. i. 7. §§ 1, 2.) The ancients dif­fered considerably in the limits they assigned to theMarmaridae: Scylax (I. c.) places them betweenApis, and the Gardens of the Hetperides; Pliny(J. c.) between Paraetoninm, and the Greater Syrtis;while Strabo (xvii. p. 838) extends their frontier tothe S. as far as the Oasis of Ammonium (Sivah).Ptolemy (iv. 5. §§ I—10) bounds the districtMarmarica, on the E. by the Plinthinetic gulf, andon the W. by a line which is drawn through thetown of Damis (Dermi); he divides this region —according to the arrangement made by the Ptolemieswhen Cyrenaica became a dependency of Aegypt—into two parts, the E. of which was called LibycusNomos (AiSinjr vinos, § 4) and the W. Mai:-maricus Nomos (Mapuapiicijs vofnos; § 2); theline of separation was made by the CatabathmusMagnus (KarrdSatftos ^i-yai, Polyb. xxxi. 26:Strab. pp. 791, 798, 825, 838; Stadiatm. p. 440;Sail.

This elevation, which rises tothe height of 900 feet, according to some authorsseparated Aegypt from Cyrenaica, and extends fromthe coast in a SSE. direction towards the Oasis ofof Ammonium. Edrisi (vol. i. p. 125, ed. Jaubert.)calls it 'Ahdbah el Svllom, or staircase descent,whence the port Solom and Soloume of most of theearlier " Portulani ;" the modern name is 'Abiltahel Kibir. Further to the E., near Paraetonium,was the smaller inclination Catabatiimi s Minor(Strab. p. 838; Solin. 30), now called 'Akdbuh elSgir, the height of which is 500 feet. Shooting outinto the sea, in the headland Jias el Kanait, it takesa direction from N. to S. to the Oasis of Ghara. Inthe sea-board of this arid space, following the coastfrom E. to W., were the promontories of Dkris (elIleyf); Hermaeum (RatelKaanis); the harbour ofGyzis or Zygis (Mahadah); Paraetonilm (Hasel I/arzeit); Apis (fioun Ajoubuh) ; the little rockscalled ScoPL'LI Tyndarei (el Chairy); PlyniPs.

(Am el Gha-zdh), with the islands Aedonia and Platra(Bomba), and Chersonesus (Rat et Tin.) Alongthe whole of this coast a road ran, the stations onwhich are given in the Peutinger Table. (Segm.viii.) One river, the Paliurus (naAioopoi,PtoL iv. 5. § 2: el Zemminih), watering the districtof Aziitis, discharges itself into the sea at the Gulfof Bomba. The interior, which was occupied bythe tribes of the Adyrmachidak and iln.i-uahmae, is described nnder Oasis. Taposiris,Apis, and Paraetoniuh were the chief towns, of T 3

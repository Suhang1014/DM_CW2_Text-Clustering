How­ever, he governed the nation jointly with his father, being in­deed no other than a king already ; and he was for that veryreason trusted, and the more firmly depended on, for thewhich he ought himself to have been put to-death, as appear­ing to have betrayed his brethren out of his concern for thepreservation of Herod, and not rather out of his ill-will tothem, and, before them, to his father himself; and this wasthe accursed state he was in.

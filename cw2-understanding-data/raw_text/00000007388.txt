But, when He­rod had bound his son, he sent letters to Rome to Caesar abouthim, and such messengers withal as should, by word of mouth,inform Caesar of Antipater's wickedness. Now, at this verytime there was seized a letter of Antiphilus, written to Anti-pater out of Egypt, (for he lived there) ; and, when it wasppened by the king, it was fsund to contain what follows: " I«' have sent thee Acme's letter, and hazarded my own life ; forf« thou knowest that I am in danger from two families, if I be" discovered. I wish thee good success in thy affair." Thesewere the contents of this letter; but the king made inquiryabout the other letter also, for it did not appear, and Antiplnlusjsslave, who brought that letter which had been read, denied thathe had received the other. But, while the king was in doubtabout it, one of Herod's friends seeing a seam upon the innercoat of the slave, and a doubling of the cloth, (for he had twocoats on), he guessed that the letter might be within that doub­ling ; which accordingly proved to be true.

I have done my endeavour that nothing that is done" against thee should be concealed from thee. So, upon my find-" ing a letter of Salome written to my lady against thee, I have" written out a copy, and sent it to thee ; with hazard to myself,f but for thy advantage.' The reason why she wrote it was this," that she had a mind to be married to SyIleus, Do thou there-" fore tear this letter in pieces, that I may not come into dan-" ger of my life." Now Acme had written to Antipatsr him­self, and informed him, that, in compliance with his command,she had both herself written to Herod, as if Salome had laid asudden plot entirely against him, and had herself sent a copy ofan epistle, as coming from Salome to her lady. Now, Acmewas a Jew by birth, and a servant to Julia, Caasar's wife ; anddid this out of her friendship for Antipater, as having been cor­rupted by him with a large present of money, to assist in hispernicious designs against his father and his aunt. 8. Hereupon Herod was so amazed at the prodigious wicked­ness of Antipater, that he was ready to have ordered him to be slain

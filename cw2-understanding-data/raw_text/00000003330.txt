A gratefulxxxvn- return is due to the author of a benefit; and who­ever is intrusted with the property of another hasbound himself to the sacred duty of restitution. Inthe case of a friendly loan, the merit of generosity ison the side of the lender only; in a deposit, on theside of the receiver: but in a pledge, and the rest ofthe selfish commerce of ordinary life, the benefit iscompensated by an equivalent, and the obligation torestore is variously modified by the nature of thetransaction. The Latin language very happily ex­presses the fundamental difference between the com-modatum and the mutuum, which our poverty is re­duced to confound under the vague and commonappellation of a loan. In the former, the borrowerwas obliged to restore the same individual thing withwhich he had been accommodated for the temporarysupply of his wants; in the latter, it was destinedfor his use and consumption, and he discharged thismutual engagement, by substituting the same specificvalue, according to a just estimation of number, ofweight, and of measure. In the contract of sale,the absolute dominion is transferred to the purchaser,and he repays the benefit with an adequate sum ofgold or silver, the price or universal standard of allearthly possessions.

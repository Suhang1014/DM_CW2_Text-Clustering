OCR Output 83 ,' ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book X. "spoil the temple, and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for"three years' time." And indeed so it came to pass, that ournation suffered these things under Antiochus Epiphanes, ac­cording to Daniel's vision, and what he wrote many years be­fore they came to pass. In the very same manner Daniel alsowrote concerning the Roman government, and that our countryshould be made desolate by them. Ah1 these things did thisman leave in writing, as God had showed them to him, inso­much, that such as read his prophecies, and see how they havebeen fulfilled, would wonder at the honour wherewith God hon­oured Daniel: and may thence discover how the Epicureans are inan error, who cast providence out of human life, and do not be­lieve that God takes care of the affairs of the world, nor that.theuniverse is governed and continued in being by that blessed andimmortal nature, but say that the world is carried along of itsown accord, without a ruler and a curator: which, were it des­titute of a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, it would belike ships without pilots, which we see drowned by the winds,or like chariots -without drivers, which are overturned, so wouldthe world be dashed in pieces by its being carried without aProvidence, and so perish, and come to nought. So that, bythe forementioned predictions of Daniel, those men seem tome very much to err from the truth, who determine, that Godexercises no providence over human affairs: for if that werethe case, that the world went on by mechanical necessity, weshould not see that all things would come to pass according tohis prophecy. Now as to myself, I have so described thesematters as I have found them and read them; but if any oneis inclined to' another opinion about them, let him enjoy hisdifferent sentiments without any blame from me.

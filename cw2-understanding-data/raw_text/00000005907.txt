OCR Output i8a THE DESCRIPTION is a man. suffering punishment for sacrilege. A womanwell acquainted with poisons, and other instruments ofpunishment, is represented tormenting him. Men there-ifore at that tine were' remarkably pious towards thegods: and this the Athenians evinced when they rook thetemple of Olympian Jupiter among the Syracusans; forthey .did not move any of die sacred offerings, and sufferedthe Syraciisan priest who guarded the offerings still tocontinue his office. This too the Mede Datis evinced:for having found a statue of Apollo in a Phœnician ship,, he immediately gave it to the Tanagræans to be carriedback to Delium. So that at that time all men venerateda divine nature; and Polygnotus well knowing this,painted the man suffering in Hades for sacrilege. Abovethose which we have now enumerated is Euryhomus,who, according to the Delphic interpretersr of sacred con-?cerns, is one of the dæmons belonging to Hades, and whoeats the flesh of dead bodies, so as to leave the bonesquite bare. However, neither Homer in the Odyssey, northe poetical composition which is called Minyas, nor theverses which are denominated No/hi, or the Return (for inthese there is an account of Hades and its terrors), makeany mention of the dæmon Eurynomus I shall thereforedescribe the figure of Eurynomus as he appears in thispicture. His colour is between azure and black, and islike that of flies which irifest meat. He shews his teethjand firs on the skin of a vulture. Auge and Iphimedea fromArcadia present themselves to the view after Eurynomus.Auge came to MyGa, which is near Tcuthras, and is saidto have brought forth a son the most like his father, ofall the women with which Hercules wr.s connected. Buithe Carians in Mylessæ pay great honours to Iphimedea.2 CHAP,

The reign of Cy-riades appears in that collection prior to the deathof Valerian; but I have preferred a probable seriesof events to the doubtful chronology of a most in­accurate writer. [141] The sack of Antioch, anticipated by somehistorians, is assigned, by the decisive testimony ofAmmianus Marcellinus, to the reign of Gallienus,xxiii. 5. [142] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 3;. [143] John Malala, torn. i. p. 391. He cor­rupts this probable event by some fabulous circum­stances. [144] Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 630. Deep rallies werefilled up with the stain. Crowds of prisoners weredriven to water like beasts, and many perished forwant of food. [14;] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 2;, asserts, that Sapor,had he not preferred spoil to conquest, might haveremained master of Asia. [146] Peter Patricius in Excerpt. Leg. p. 29. £147] Syrorum Agrestium manu. Sextus Rasas,c 23. Rufus, Victor, the Augustan History (p. 192.),and several inscriptions agree in making Odenathusa citizen of Palmyra. [148] He possessed so powerful an interest amongthe wandering tribes, that Procopius (Bell. Persic.1. ii. c. 5.) and John Malala (torn. i. p. 391.) stylehim Prince of the Saracens. [149] Peter Patricius, p. 25. [150] The Pagan writers lament, the Christianinsult, the misfortunes of Valerian. Their varioustestimonies are accurately collected by Tillemont,torn. iii. p. 739, &c. So little has been preservedof Eastern history before Mahomet, that the mo­dern Persians are totally ignorant of the victory of Vol. I. Sapor, an event so glorious to their nation. SeeBibliotheque Orient ale. [151] Cne of these epistles is from Artavasdes,king of Armenia: since Armenia was then a pro­vince to Persia, the king, the kingdom, and theepistle, must be fictitious.

Grxc.1. iv. [ 15 j] This singular character has, I believe, beenfairly transmitted to us. The reign of his imme­diate siiccessor was short and busy; and the histo­rians who wrote before the elevation of the familyof Constantine, could not have the most remoteinterest to misrepresent the character of Gallienas. [156] Pollio expresses the most minute anxietyto complete the number. [157] The place of his reign is somewhat doubt­ful; but there no as a tyrant in Pontus, and we areacquainted with the feat of all the others. [158] Tillemont, torn. iii. p. 1163, reekons themsomewhat differently. [159] See the speech of Marius, in the AugustanHistory, p. 197. The accidental identity of nameswas the only circumstance that could tempt Pollioto imitate Sallust, [160] Vos O Fompilius fanguis ! is Horace's ad­dress to the Pisos. See Art.

Strabo tells usthat it was originally an Ausonian city, but sub­sequently occupied by a colony of Aetoliaus who hadaccompanied Thoas to the Trojan War.

(Strab. Lc; Steph. It. t. v.; Sehol. adHorn. <>!■■<. I. c.) We have no account of Temesahaving received a Greek colony in historical timesthough it M-ems to have become to a great extentHctlenised, like so many other cities in this part ofItaly. At one period, indeed, we learn that it wasconquered by the Locrians (about 480—460 B.C.);but we know not how long it continued subject totheir rule, (Strab. lc.) Neither Scylax norScyninu*Chius mention it among the Greek: cities in thiitpart of Italy; but Livy says expressly that it was aGreek, city before it fell into the hands of the Brut-tians (Liv. xxxiv. 45).

Its copper mines, which are alludedto by several writers (Ovid, Mel. xv. 706; Stat. Silv.i. 1. 42). had ceased to be productive in the days ofStrabo (Strab. vi. p. 256).

Cape Corveiro, the westernmost pointof the continent, Wing between the mouths of theDaradus and the Stachir; the headland of Byssa-dium, Cape Blanco, a continuation of the moun­tain ridge of that name, and a few miles southwardof Arsinarium; the promontories of Catharon (toKadapbv axpop). Cape Darca, near the mouth of theNia, and of the Hesperides, celebrated in fable('Etnripov Kt'pas, PtoL; Hesperion Ceras, Plin. v. 1.s. 1), the Cape Verde of the Portuguese : lastly,the term of H.innos voyage, the baaaltic rock en­titled the headland of Notium (NoVov Ktpas), Capekoxo, or Red Cape, from the colour of its surface.Between the two last-mentioned projections lav theHesperian bay ('E*nr«pior k6k*o\), which, owing totheir misconception of the extent of this continent,the ancients regarded as the southern boundary ofLibya, the point from which it crossed towards Asia,or where the great Southern Ocean commenced. While enumerating the mountains which con­cealed their springs, we have nearly exhausted thecatalogue of the Libyan rivers which flow into theAtlantic It is a consequence of the terraced con­formation of the interior, that the streams would, forthe mast part, take an easterly or a westerly direc­tion. Those which ran east wt-rc the tributaries ofthe lake*,morasses, and rivers of Aethiopia, and, withthe exception of such as fed the As t a pus and theAstaboras, have been scarcely explored. On thewestern side the most important were (Ptol. iv. 6. §8)the Sub us (2,ov€at), the modem Sus, and combining,if not the same, with the Chretes (XpfTijs) and theXion (Huvc) (Scylax, p. 53), had its source in Mt.♦Sagapola, and entered the Atlantic below the fur­thest western projection of the Greater Atlas. Mt.Mandrus gave birth to the Salathus, at the mouthof which stood a town of the same name; to theChusarius (Xowrdpios), apjiarently the Cosenus ofPolybius {ap. Plin. v. 1. a. 1); to the Ophiodes('O^iwSTft) and Novius (Noi/i'os), between the head­lands of Gannarinm and Solocis; and, lastly, theMassa orMasasat. (Polyb. L c.) In Mount Caphasarises a more considerable stream than any of theabove-mentioned, the modern Rio de Ouro, theaircient Daradus (AcEpaSu*, Aapa/r), which containedcrocodiles, and discharged itself into the SinusMagnus. The appearance of the crocodile in thisriver, and the dark population which inhabited itsbanks in common with those of the Niger, led manyof the ancient geographers to imagine that the Nile,wherein similar phenomena were observed, took awesterly course S. of Meroe, and, crossing the con­tinent, emptied itself a second time into the sea inthe extreme west The Aethiopes Hesperii wereamong the consequences of this fiction, and wereLxdirved to be of the same race with the Aethiopiansof the Nile. Next in order southward was theStachir (2tiIx«*/>), which rose in Mt. Ryssadius,and, after forming the Lake CIonia, proceeded in aSE. direction to the bay of the Hesperides. TheStachir is probably represented by the present St.Antonio river, or Rio de (iuaon, and seems toanswer to the Salsus of pnlybius {ap. Plin. I.e.).The same bay receives the waters of the Nia, theRun bolus of Polybius, and the modern Senegal.The river-horse, as well as the crocodile, inhabitits streams, and the hides of the former were ex­ported by the neighbouring tribe of Daratae to Car­thage. The MastthoJus, the present Gambia, de­ sconds into the Atlantic from the Theou Ochrma, alittle N. of the Hippodrome of the Aethit>uar«{'\irv6BpofAos Aidioa-i'af), or Cape Roxo, with wh.chterminates the geographer Ptolemy's Itinerary <sfthe Libyan coast. He mentions, indeed, a few rivenin the interior which have no outlet to the sra,but form vast inland lakes. These are, probably,either tributaries of the Niger, or the upper port»aof the arms of the Niger itself; buttbecouiseof th*streams that flow southward to Nigritia and t..eRight of Benin belongs rather to modern than toancient geography. It is worthy of notice, how­ever, that rumours at least of the dimensions of theNiger must have reached the ears of the old geo­graphers (Agathem. ii. 10; Plin. v. 1. a. I), sincethey ascribe to the Gcr or Gir ( Tab. Peutmg. Girin)a course of more than 300 miles, with a farthercurvature to the N. of 100, where it ends in thelake Chelonides. The direct mainstream was re­presented as diving underground, reappearing on tiesurface, and finally discharging itself into a lakecalled Nuba. Libya, indeed, " is ft region of extensive lakes: ofwhich there appear to be a great number on thelowlands of its east coast, in which many of ti<-rivers from the edge of the table-hind terminAte."(Somerville, Physical Geog. vol. ii. p. 9.) In LibyaN. of the equator the following were known to theancients:—The Tritonia (Aeschyl. fume*. 2**9;Pindar, Pyth. iv. 36 ; Scylax, p.49 : Herod, it. 178);the lake of the Hesperides (Strab. xviii. p. 836);the Libya Palus, which was connected with theNiger by one of its tributaries; the Clooia, near theeastern Hank of the Mount Kyssadium : the Ni;ritrf,into which the upper portion of the Xigir flowed,probably the present Dibbeh of the Arabs, or \\xBlack-Water, S\V*. of Timbuctoo: the Nuba, inwhich the river Ger terminates, and which ana*erato Lake Tchad, or Nou in Bornott, and whose di­mensions almost entitle it to the denomination >>f afresh-water sea; and lastly, the cluster uf laVr*named Chelonides, perhaps the modem AVtfre,into which an arm of the Ger flows, and which aresurrounded with jungle and pastures celebrated fcrtheir herds of elephants. Salt-water lakes aboundon the northern extremity of the -SoArfro, and th*salt obtained from them has been in every ace anarticle of barter w-.th the south, where that ner**.*Arrof life is wholly wanting. It is obtained either fnsnthese lakes, which, dried up by the summer heat,leave behind a vast quantity of salt, covering ex­tensive patches of the earth, or from large bed*. *elayers, which frequently extend fur many miles. ai*irise into hills. The inhabitants of Nigritia rarrttsesalt with gold-dust. A scarcity of talt in A'asAwaand Timbuctoo is equivalent to a famine in otherlands. At such times the price of salt becomes soextravagant, that Leo Africanus (p, 250) saw *aasi's load sold at Timbuctoo for eighty ducats, Theneighbourhood of the lakes is also celebrated fce* thenumber and luxuriance of its date trees. To theborderers of the Desert the date tree is what thebread-fruit tree is to the South Sea islanders.

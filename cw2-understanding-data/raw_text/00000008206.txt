In the dearth of any more accurate informationwe cannot fix the situation of these venerable relicsof Roman antiquity more precisely than may begathered from the preceding general indications.M. Valerius Messala and C. Cassius Longinus, whowere censors in B.C. 154. projected, and even began,a theatre at this spot, which was to extend from theLupercal on the Germalus towards the Palatine.But this scheme was opposed by the rigid moralityof Scipio Nasica, and all the works were put up toauction and sold. (Veil. Pat. i. 15; Val. Max. ii.4. § 2; Appian, B. C. i. 28.) The Lupercal is men­tioned in the Monttmentum Ancyranwn, as recon­structed by Augustus; whence Canina infers thatthe ancient one must have been destroyed whenthis theatre was commenced. (/naHcazioiie Topogr.p. 460, 1850.) The Casa Roinuli is represented byFabius Pictor, as translated by Dionysius of Hali-carnassus (i. 79), to have been carefully preservedin his time, the damage occasioned by age or tem­pests being made good according to the ancientpattern. Whether the building mentioned in theNotitia was still the same it is impossible to say. We have already noticed, when treating of thecity of Romulus, the Sanitcary of Victoria—most probably a sacred grove—and the CuvusVictoriab on the NW. slope of the Palatine.At or near this spot an Aedh-s Matkih Drumwas erected b. c. 191, to contain the image of theMater Idaea, which Scipio Nasica had broughtfrom Asia thirteen years before. (Liv. xxxvi. 35;Cic. liar. R. 12.) It must have been to the N. ofthe Casa Romuli, since it is mentioned after it inthe Notitia* when proceeding in that direction, yetat some distance from the N. point of the hill, be­tween which and the temple the Domus Tiberianamust have intervened. It is recorded as having beentwice burnt down; once in n. c. 110, when it wasrebuilt by Metellus (Jul. Obs. 99), and again inA. i>. 2, in the same fire which destroyed the palaceof Augustus, by whom it was restored. (Val. Max.i. 8. § 11 ; Diun Cass. lv. 12; Man. Auqp-.). Itmust also have been destroyed in the conflagrationunder Nero, and again rebuilt. Becker (/landb.p. 421) observes that its front must have laced theK-, as the statue of the Magna Mater ldaea isdescribed by Dion Cassius as looking that way(xlvi. 43). But this relates only to the statue;and we fancy that there is some reason to believe,from a passage in Martial, that the temple was around one, and could not therefore be properly saidto face any way. In this passage two temples arementioned (i. 70. 9):— "Flecte vias hac qua mrwluli sunt tecta LyaeiEt Cybeles picto stat Cory bante thoi us." Becker observes (p. 422) that the age and situationof the temples here mentioned cannot be determined,as they occur nowhere else; and this seems to be trueof the temple of Bacchus; but there apj>ear« to bo noreason why the Thou s Cykklks—which lWkcrwrites Torus, without any apparent meaning—maynot have been the Aedes Matris Deum before referredto. The description of the road to the house ofProculus given in this epigram suits the situationof this temple; and the house itself is mentioned us"nec propior quam Phoebus amat." Now, the templeof Apollo, built by Augustus, lay close to that of theldacau Mother, as we shall see presently; and, 3 F 2

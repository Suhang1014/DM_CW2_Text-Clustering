Passing the Noti Cornu ofPtolemy (ELKhaU), the voyager arrived at the"Strands" (aryiaAol), the Little and the Great,extending six days according to the Periplus, eightaccording to Ptolemy's authorities, though he wouldreduce the distance to four natural days. The LittleStrand, which occurs first, is doubtless the SelfTamil, or "Long Sword," of the Arab pilots, socalled from its curvature. The Great Strand isprobably the district now called Mtrit, "DryDesert." These have an extent of 300 miles. Nextcomes the peopled shore where Ptolemy (i. 17. § 11)places 3 towns, Essixa ("Eo-crii'a), the SarapionisPortus (Zopawitci'o! ofijuis). and Tosice or Nict,the Nicon of the Periplus.

(Strab. xii.p. 555; Appian, Mithrid. 101, 105; Dion Cass,xxxv. 33; Caes. Bell. Alex. 36; Plin. vi. 10.) Itwas situated in a valley of the river Lycus, a tribu­tary of the Iris (Acta Martyr, torn. iii. Jul. p. 46),at a distance of 100 miles to the north-west of Sa-tala, and 98 to the north-east of Sebastia. It wasa populous town as early as the time of Strabo; butduring the last period of the Empire it appears to havosuffered much, and its decayed walls were restored byJustinian.

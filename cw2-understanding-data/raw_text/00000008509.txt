Meanwhile Sempronius, whowas newly arrived, after a short interval of repose,was eager for a general engagement, and his confi­dence was increased by a fiartial success in a combatof cavalry, in the plain between the Trobia and thePad as (/6. 69.) Hannibal, who on his side \sasequally desirous of a battle, took advantage of thistlisjwsitiou of Sempronius, and succeeded in drawinghim out of his camp, where he could not venture toattack him, into the plain below, which was favour­able to the operations of the Carthaginian cavalryand elephants. For this purpose lie sent forward abody of Numidiau horse, who crossed the Trebiaand approached the Iioman camp, but, as soon as aU>dy of Roman cavalry and light-armed troops weresent out against them, retreated skirmishing untilthey had recrossed the river. Seinprouius followedwith his whole army, ami crossed the Trebia, notwithout difficulty, for the river was swollen with laterains, and was only just fordable fur the infantry.His troops suffered severely from cold and wet, andwhen the two armies met in order of battle, earlybegan to feel themselves inferior to the enemy ; butthe victory was decided by a body of 1000 foot and1000 horse, under the command of Mago, the brotherof Hannibal, which had been placed by that generalin ambuscade, in the hollow bed of a stream whichcrossed the field of battle, and by a sudden onset onthe rear of the Iioman army, threw it into completeconfusion. A body of about 10,000 Roman infantryhucceeded in forcing their way through the centre ofthe enemy's line, but finding themselves isolated, andtheir retreat to their camp quite cut off* they directedi heir inarch at once towards Placentia, and succeededin reaching that city in safety. The other troopswere thrown back in confusion upon the Trebia, andsull'ered very heavy loss in passing that river ; buttlio.se who succeeded in crossing it, fell back upon thebody already mentioned and made good their retreatwith them to Placcutia. Thither also Scipio on thefollowing day repaired with that part of ihe Romanforces which had not been engaged in the battle.(Pol. iii. 70—74.) Prom the view above given of the battle and theoperations that preceded it, which coincides with thatof General Vandoncourt (Campagnes dAtmibal enItalic, vol. i. pp. 93—130), it seems certain that thebattle itself was fought on the left bank of theTrebia, in the plain, but a short distance from thetoot of the hills ; while the Roman camp was on thehills, and on the right bank of the Trebia. It iscertain that this view affords much the most intelli­gible explanation of the o|»erations of the armies, audthere is nothing in the narrative of Polybius (whichhas been exclusively followed in the above account)inconsistent with it, though it must be admittedthat some difficulties remain unexplained. Livy'anarrative on the contrary is confused, and thoughbased for the most part on that of Polybius, seemsto be mixed up with that of other writers. (Liv,xxi. 52—56.) From his account of the retreat ofthe Roman army aud of Scipio to Placentia after thebattle, it seems certain that he considered the Romancamp to be situated on the left bank of the river, sothat Scipio must necessarily cross it in order to arriveat Placentia, and therefore he must have couceivedthe battle as fought on the right bank: and thisview has been adopted by many modern writers, in­cluding Niebuhr and Arnold; but the difficulties inits way greatly exceed those which arise on the con­ trary hypothesis. Niebuhr indeed smnmarl*of some of these, by maintaining, in cpp&a i u a»distinct statements of Polybius, that Eiue^ -a.crossed the Padus below PLactntia, ladtbc fcrr-s*-nius joined Scipiofroni Genua aiid oo» trum Anii^Such arbitary assumptions as the>e are •trx,:* r.discussing a question, the decision <£ vtxc Et:rest mainly, if not entirely, an the xwm gPolybius.

THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR. 249 several nations of Greek descent settled in Sicily, beingall Doric, and independent, acted together in concert.Of the barbarous people they had those Siculi alonewho did not openly revolt to the Athenians; but, outof Sicily, the Lacedæmonians sent them a citizen of Spar­ta to command, and a body of Neodamodes and Helots.By a Neodamas is meant a citizen newly enfranchised.The Corinthians alone aided them both with shippingand a-land-force, in conjunction with the Leucadiansand Ambiaciots, by blood allied to Syracuse.

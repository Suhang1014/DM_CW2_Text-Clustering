So, when the German hadsaid this, he made Agrippa laugh at him as much as he after- 'wards appeared worthy of admiration. But now Antonia tookAgrippa?s misfortune to heart ; however, to speak to Tiberiuson his behalf, she took to be a very difficult thing, and indeedquite impracticable, as to any hope of success ; yet did she pro­cure of Macro, that the soldiers that kept him should be of agentle nature, and that the centurion who was over them, andwas to diet with him, should be of the same disposition, and thathe might have leave to bathe himself every day, and that hisfreed-men and friends might come to him, and that other thingsthat tended to ease him might be indulged him. So his friendSilas came in to him, and two of his freed-men, Marsyras andStechus, brought him such sorts of food as he was fond of, andindeed took great care of him ; they also brought him garments,under pretenqe of selling them, and, when night came on, theylaid them under him ; and the soldiers assisted them, as Macrohad given them order to do beforehand. And this was Agrippa'scondition for six months time, and in this case were his affairs.8. But for Tiberius, upon his return to Capreae, he fell sick,At first his distemper was but gentle ; but, as that distemperincreased upon him, he had small or no hopes of recovery.Hereupon he bid Euodus, who-was that freed-man whom hemost of all respected, to bring the children * to him ; for thathe wanted to talk to them before he died. Now he had at pre­sent no sons of his own alive ; for Drusus, who was his onlyson, was dead ; but Drusus' s son Tiberius was still living,whose additional name was Gemellus : there was also living Caius,the son of Germanicus, who was the sonf of his brother [Dru-Sus]. He was now grown up, and had a liberal education,and was well improved by it, and was in esteem and favour with)the people, on account of the excellent character of his fatherGermanicus, who had attained the highest honour among themultitude, by the firmness of his virtuous behaviour, by theeasiness and agreeableness of his conversing with the multitude,,and because the dignity he was in did not hinder his familiaritywith them all, as if they were his equals ; by which behaviourhe was not only greatly esteemed by the people and the senate,but by every one of those nations that were subject to the Ro­mans ; some of which were affected, when they came to him,with the gracefulness of their reception by him, and others were' affected * Tiberius his own grandson, and Caius his brother Drusus's grandson.t So I correct Joseplius'-s copy, which calls Germanicus his brother, who WMhis brother'? son.

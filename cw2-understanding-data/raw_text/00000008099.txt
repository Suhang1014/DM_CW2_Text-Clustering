(Ovid, Amor. ii. 16. 6, 7;Martial, i. 27. 5, xiii. 121.) < »f the diameter ofthe Peligni, we know only that they wore esteemedas rivalling in bravery their neighbours the Marsi(Plin. iii. 12. s. 17: Cic. in Vat in. 15; Sil. Ital.viii. 510), and that from their secluded positionthey always retained the primitive simplicity oftheir habits. From an expression of Horace itwould appear also that they shared with the Marsithe reputation of skill in magical ineaiit.tti.nis, (Hor,Epod. 17. (10.) The Peligni had only three principal towns, Coit- FINIL'M, Si LMO, and SiTEKAKlJL'l M. of which the two first only an; known historically, and weredoubtless much the most important places. HutPliny notices all three in his list of towns; and thesame names are found also in the Liber Coloniarum.(Plin. /.<•.; Lib. Vol*, pp. 228, 229.) Hencethese are obviously the three alluded to hy Ovid,when he calls his native town of Sulmo *' Pelignipars tertia ruris*' (Amor, ii. 16); and it thus ap­pears there were no other places in the districtwhich enjoyed municipal rank and had a territoryof their own. Cuct'Li'M, mentioned only by Strabo(v. p. 241) as situated to the right of the ViaValeria, is evidently the modern Cnrullo. and musthave been in the territory of the Peligni, but wasprobably an insignificant place. Statulae, knownonly from the Tabula as a station on the Via Valeria,7 miles from Corfinium, on the E. of the Monsline us, must have been situated at or near the vil­lage of Goriano. The territory of the Peligni must always havebeen an important point in regard to the communi­cations of the different nations of Central Italy. Onthe one side a natural pass, now known as the ForcaCaruso, called in the Tabula the Moss Lmei's,connected the basin of the Gtzio and lower valleyof the Aternus with the land of the Marsi and basinof the lake Fucinus; on the other the remarkablepass or gorge through which the Aternus forces itsway just below Popoli, afforded a natural outlet,through which these upland valleys had a directcommunication with the sea. These two passes, inconjunction with that which led from the basin ofthe Fucinus to Carseoli, formed a natural line ofway from Rome and the Tyrrhenian sea to theAdriatic, which was undoubtedly frequented longbefore the Romans subdued the Severn) nationsthrough which it (Missed, and ages before the ViaValeria was laid down as an artificial road. Thathighway, indeed, was not continued through theland of the Peligni, and thence to the sea, until thereign of the emperor Claudius [Cerfkmnia]. Inthe other direction also the valley of the Ohio,opening into that of the Aternus, afforded directmeans of communication with Reate, Interamna, andthe valley of the Tiber, while at its southern ex­tremity a practicable pass led through the heart ofthe Apennines into the valley of the Sagrus, and thusopened a direct line of communication with theinterior of Samnium. The importance of this lineof mute, as well as the early period at w hich it wasfrequented, is shown by the circumstance that itwa> followed by the Roman armies in b. c. 340,when the Samnites, as well as the Marsi and Peligni,were friendly, and the revolt of the Latins cut offtheir natural line of march into Campania. (Liv.viii. 6.) This line of road, as given in the Tabula, ledfrom Corfmium by Sulmo to Aufidena, and thence ! to Aesernia and Venafrum. At tbe aisto* ^7- miles from Sulmo that itinerary yUces i sULlocalled " < Juris Larene," evidently the site uf & temps*,on the highest part of the pass.

(Cluver, ItaL p. 759: Hoist en. A*t dCluvtr. p. 145; Roinanelli, vol. iii. p. 165.) It twa. appears that the ancient raid followed a more nr-I cuitous but easier line than the in.4l«*rn hir'nnai,and thus avoided the passage of the Pumodi»Miglia, an upland valley at the highest i*rt •< uspass, much dreaded in winter and spring <* *■count of the terrific storms of wind and fwhich it is subject.

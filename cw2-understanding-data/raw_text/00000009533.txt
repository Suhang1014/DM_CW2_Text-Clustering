OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 139 as these should be engaged in skirmishing, he shouldcharge with the cavalry from a place of concealment.A conveniently projecting mountain covered the am­bush of the cavalry, and the battle began without de­lay; for the Spaniards rushed on the cattle as soonas they saw them at a distance, and the light infantryattacked them, occupied with their booty.

[iucM.] Tne inhabitants of Tr:<a£. called Troes (T>«fj"),and by Roman prose-irriters Tr jard or Teacn.were in all probability a Pelas£tan race, and seem tohave consisted of two branches. o:,e of which, theTeucri, had emigrated from Thrace, and becomeamalgamated with the Phrygian or native popolfr*ti'jn of the country. Hence the Trojans are some­time) called Teucri and sometimes Phryges. (Herud.v. 122, viL 43; Strab. i. p. 62, siii. p. t>04: Vire.A en. i. 33. 248, ii. 252, 671. &c.) The poet ofthe Iliad in several points treats tiie Trojans asinferior in civiH-ation to his own countrymen;but it is impossible to say whether in such caseshe describes the r<*al state of things, or whe­ther lie di>es so only from a natural partiality forhis own countrymen. According to the common legend, the kingdom ofTroy was overturned at the capture and burning ofIlium in rs. r. 1184; but it is attested on prottygood authority that a Tr<jan state survived thecatastrophe of its chief city, and that the kingdomwas finally destroyed by an invasion of Phrygianswho crossed over from Europe into Asia. (Xanthus.up. Strab. xiv. p. 680. xii. p. 572.) This fact isindirectly continued ly the testimony of Hornerhimself, who makes Poseidon predict that theposterity of Aeneas should long continue to reignirvcr the Trojans, after the race of Priam should beextinct.

Eastathius (ad 11. p. 2S7) says that itis in "Massaliotic Italy." Char-ax is Stephanas*authority. This brief notice adds one more to the listof Massaliotjc settlements on the coast of the Medi­terranean ; but we know nothing of Troezen. [G.

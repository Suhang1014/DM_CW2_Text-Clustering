OCR Output NOTES ON THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER. Ivii Aurel. Victor, who has treated the character ofDiocletian with good fense, though in bad Latin. [ic6] Solus omnium, post conditum RomanumImperium, qui cx tanto falligio fponte ad privatævit<e datum civilitatemque remearet. Hutrop.ix. 28. [107] The particulars of the journey and illnessare taken from Lactantius (c. 17,) who may sometimesbe admitted as an evidence of public facts, thoughvery seldom of private anecdotes. [108] Aurelius Victor ascribes the abdication,which had been so variously accounted for, to twocauses. 1st, Diocletian's contempt of ambition;and 2dly, His apprehension of impending troubles.One of the panegyrists (vi. 9 ) mentions the ageand infirmities of Diocletian, as a very naturalreason for his retirement. [icq] The difficulties as well as mistakes at­tending the dates both of the year and of the day ofDiocletian's abdication, arc perfectly cleared up byTillemont, Hist, des Empereurs, torn. iv. p. 525.Note 19, and by Pagi ad annum.

The orationwas pronounced after Maximian had reaslumed thepurple. » [111] Eumenius pays him a very fine compliment,"At enim divinum ilium virum, qui primus Im-"perium et participavit et posuit, consilii et facti"sui non pœnitet; nec amisiile se putat quod sponte"transcripsit. F.elix beatusque vere quem vestra,*' tantorum principum, colunt obsequia privatum."Panegyr. Vet. vii. 15. [ 11 z] We are obliged to the younger Victor forthis celebrated bon mft. Eutropius mentions thething in a more general manner. [113] Hist. August, p. Z23 224. Vopiscus hadlearned this conversation from his father. [114] The younger Victor slightly mentions thereport. But as Diocletian had disobliged a power­ful and successful party, his memory has beenloaded with every crime and misfortune. It hasbeen affinred that he died raving mad, that he wascondemned as a ciiminal by the Roman senate, &c. VOL I. [115] See the Itineraries, p. 269. 272. Edit.Wesseling. [116] The Abate Fortis, in his Viaggio in Dal-mazia, p. 43. (printed at Venice, in the year 1774,in two small volumes in quarto) quotes a MS.account of the antiquities of Salona, composed byGiambattiila Giustiniani about the middle of thexvith century. [117] Adam's antiquities of Diocletian's palaceat Spalatro, p. 6. We may add a circumstance ortwo from the -Abate Fortis: the little stream ofthe Hyader, mentioned by Lucan, produces mostexquisite trout, which a sagacious writer, perhapsa monk, supposes to have been one of the principalreasons that determined Diocletian in the choice ofhis retirement. Fortis, p. 45. The fame author(p. 38.) observes, that a taile for agriculture isreviving at Spalatro; and that an experimental farmhas lately been established near the city, by asociety of Gentlemen.

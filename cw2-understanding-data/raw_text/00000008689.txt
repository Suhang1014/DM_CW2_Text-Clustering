In the time of Palladio the temple wasa jrreat deal more perfect tiian it is at present, andhad an atrium in front, in the middle of which stoodthe bronze equestrian statue of M. Aurelius, whichnow adorns the Capitol, (Arrhitttturn, lib. iv. c. 9.)The inscription in Grater (celia. 6) probably be­longed to the pedestal of this .statue. It was foundin the Sacra Via in 15G2. Sonic difficulty, however,arises with regard to this account, since from variousother sources we learn that the statue stood for along while before the church of St. John I.atcran.From Palladio's account of tlie corlile, or court, itwonki appear that the building lay some distanceback from the Sacra Via. In the reign of Commodus a instructive fire,which lasted several days, occasioned much damagein the neighbourhood of the forum, and destroyedamong other things the temple of Vesta. (Hcrodian,i. 14.) According to Dion Capitis the same fire ex­tended to the Palatine and coiiMimed almost all therecords of the empire (laxii. 24). It wax on thet-ame occasion that the shop of (ialen, which stoodon the* Sacra Via, was burnt down, and also thePalatine Library, as he himself assures us. (OeCompos. Medkam, i. c. 1.) This damage seems to have been repaired bySeptiinius Sevcrus, the munificent restorer of theRoman buildings, who with a rare generosity com­monly refrained from inscribing his own name uponthem, and left their honours to the rightful founders(" Homae omnes aedes publican, quae vitio temporumlabebantur, in*tauravit; nusquam prope suo nomineinscripto, servatis tamen ubique titulis conditornm,"Spart. Sever, c. ult.). Of the original monumentserected by that emperor the principal one wis the Ait-ctis Sevkui or triumphal arch, which still exists ingood preservation at the top of the Roman forum.

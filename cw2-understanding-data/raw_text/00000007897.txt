A town of Zeugis is mentionedby Aethicus (Cosmogr. p. (1.1). and a Zengitanns, ap­parently a mountain, by Solinus ("a pede Zeugi-tano," c. 27), which is perhaps the same as theMoos Ziguensis of Victor (de Persec. Vandal, iii.),the present Zow-vxm; and according to Shaw(Travels, i. p. 191, sq.), if the existence of a townor mountain so named is not altogether problema­tical, the province probably derived its name fromeither one or the other. The district was bounded onthe S. by Byzacium, on the W. by Numidia, fromwhich it was divided by the liver Tusca (now Zaine),and on the N. and E. by the Mare Internum. Afterthe time of Caesar it appears to have been calledProvincia Vetus, or Africa Propria, as opposed tothe later acquired Numidia. (Dion Cass, xliii. 10;Plin. /. c.; Mela, i. 7.) Strabo mentions it only asri Kapx^SoWa, or the province of Carthage (vi. p.267, &c). It embraced the modern Frigeah (whichis doubtless a corruption of the ancient name of Af­rica) or northern part of the kingdom of Tunis.Zeugitana was watered by the Bagradas, and was avery fertile country. There were no towns of im­portance iti the interior, but on the coast we findSiagul, Neapolis, Gnrubis, Aspis or Clupea, Carpis,Tunes, Carthago, Castra Cornelia, Utica, and HippoDiarrhytus.

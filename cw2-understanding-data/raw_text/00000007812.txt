This territory is shut in on everyside by lofty mountains, offshoots of Mt. Cyllene andthe Arounian chain; and it is about 7 miles inlength and the same in breadth. Two streams de­scend from the northern mountains, and unite theirwaters about the middle of the valley; the unitedriver is now culled Foiiitttiko, and bore in ancienttimes the name of Olbius and Amaliius. (Paus. viii.14. ^ 3.) There is no opening through the moun­tains oti the S.: but the waters of the united river arecarried off by katarothra, or subterranean channelsin the limestone rocks, and, after (Whig under­ground, reappear as the sources of the river La don.In order to convey the waters of this river in asingle channel to the hntavothra, the inhabitants atan early period constructed a canal, 50 stadia inlength, and 30 feet in breadth. (Pans. /. c; comp.Catull. Ixviii. 109.) Tins groat work, which wasattributed to Hercules, had heroine useless in thetime of Pausanhis, and the river had resumed itsancient and irregular course; but traces of the canalof Hercules are still visible, and one hank of it wasa conspicuous object in the valley when it was visitedby Leake in the year 1.806. The canal of Hercules,however, could not protect the valley from the dan­ger to which it was exposed, in consequence of thehitavothra becoming obstructed, and the river findingno outlet for its waters. The Pheneatae relatedthat their city was nine destroyed by such an inun­dation, and in proof of it they pointed out upon themountains the marks of the height to which thewater was said to have ascended. (Pans. viii. 14.§ 1.) Pausanias evidently refers to tin: yellowborder which is still visible upon the mountains andaround the plain; but in consequence of the greatheight of this line upon the rocks, it is difficult tobelieve it t<> be the mark of the ancient depth ofwater in the ['lain, and it is more probably causedby evaporation, as Leake has suggested; the lowerparts of the rock being constantly moistened, whilethe upper are in a state of comparative dryness, thusproducing a difference of colour in process of time.It is, however, certain that the Pheneatic plain hasbeen exposed more than once to such inundations.Pliny says that the calamity had occurred five times(xxxi. 5. s. 30); and Eratosthenes related a me­morable instance of such an inundation through theobstruction of the kutavolhra, when, after they wereagain opened, the water rushing into the Lad on andthe Alpheius overflowed the banks of those riversat < Hyinpia. (Strah. viii. p. 389.) The account of Eratosthenes has been confirmedby a similar occurrence in modern times. In 1821the htfavothra became obstructed, and the watercontinued to rise in the plain till it had destroyed7 or 8 square miles of cultivated country. Suchwas its condition till 1832, when the s*ubterraneouschannels again opened, the Ladon and Alpheiusovert!owed, and the plain of Olympia was inundated.Other ancient writers allude to the hUavuthra andsubterraneous course of the river of Phencus.(Theophr.

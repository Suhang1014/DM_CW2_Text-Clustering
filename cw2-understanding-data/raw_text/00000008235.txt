Vl«trau6pta:Eth. M*<rr}u€ptav6s). 1. An important Greek cityin Thrace, situated on the coast of the Euxineand at the foot of Alt. Haetnus (Scymn. Ch. 738);consequently upon the confines of Aloesia, in whichit is placed by Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 8). Strabo (vii.p. 319) relates that it was a colony of the Ale-garians, and that it was originally called Alenebria(Mfff^(a) after its founder Alenas; Stephanus B.(*. r.) says that its original name was Alelsembna(MrA'iijuS^i'a), from its founder Alelsas; and bothwriters state that the termination -bria was theThracian word for town. According to the Ano­nymous Peri pi us of the Euxine (p. 14) Afesembriawas founded by Chalcedonians at the time of theexpedition of Darius against Scythia; but accordingto Herodotus (vi. 33) it was founded a little later,after the suppression of the Ionic revolt, by Byzantineand Chalcedonian fugitives. These statements may,however, be reconciled by supposing that the Thra­cian town was originally colonized by Alegarians, andafterwards received additional colonists from By­zantium and Chaleedon. Alesembria was one of thecities, forming the Greek Pent a polls on the Enxine,the other four being Odessa*, Totni, Istriani and Apol-lonialae. (See BoVkh, Jnscr. vol. ii. p. 996.) Me-aemhria is rarely mentioned in history, but it con­tinued to exist till a late period. (Mela, ii. 2;Plin. iv. 11. i. 18; Ptot. I c.; Tab. Pent) 2.

MESE'XE (M«rw)|, Strab. ii. p. 84), a aaaafltract of land in ancient Mesopotamia, ah ml Lvexact position of which there has been much <L-»-cussion, owing to the indistinct and o infused »:-counts of it which have been preserved in anrsrttauthors. The real cause of this would aeern tJ V-that there were two districts at no great disMor*one from the other, both of which, fnwn auizkcreasons, bore the name of Alesene, or Middle-Laa*One of these was near the mouths of the Tiprm.where that river is divided into two brmncboa, e»-responding to tlie modern tract called Shot'-sU-Arab(Steph. B. *. e. Mwiirq.) To this Aleseue- marfbe referred the passage in Philostorgios (//. £.iii. 7), in which he states that the Tigris, hef/re creaches the sea, is divided into two great bran* b^forming an extensive island, which is inhabited bythe Aleseni. To this also belongs the Alesene, men­tioned in the history of Trajan by Dion L'mju,who calls it an island in the Tigris, over wUhAthambilus was the ruler (lxriii. 28). The iti>rwas much higher up on the same river, and hasderived its chief importance from its capital Apaiijria.Stephanus speaks of this tract in two places ; fers*(s. v. 'Awdfitia), where he states that thai city issurrounded by the Tigris, where that liver m di­vided into two streams, of which that on the rifL;hand is called I Mas, and that on the left bear* thename of Tigris; and secondly (*. r. 'OpaBa), wbmhe asserts that Oratha is a town of Alesene. whichis near the Tigris, according to Arrian, in the 16ubook of his Parthica. Pliny evidently refers to this Alesene, when be mspeaking of Apameia, which town he state* to hawbeen 125 miles on this side (i.e. to the X.) «■*Seleuccia; the Tigris being divided into two chan­nels, by one of which it Hows to the & and toSeleuceia, washing all along Alesene (vi. 27. ». 31 XThere might have been some doubt to which MneoeAmmianus refers; but as he mentkcie T*-r*d««,which was near the mouth of the Tigris, it t* pruhaf-Jrthat he is speaking of the former one (x-XiT. 3}.The district in the neighbourhood of the Apan>*iMiAlesene has been surveyed with great care by Ljrut-Lynch; and, from his observations, it seems alirvjricertain that the more northern Alesene was theterritory now comprehended between ti/« I*jrUand the Tigris.

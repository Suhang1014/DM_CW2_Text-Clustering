The distance from Cassel throughBethxme to Arras is 43 II P. The distance ac­cording to the Antonine Itin. from Cassel throughMinariacnm [Minartactm] is 55 M. P. There isalso a route from Tarucnna (Th^rouenne) of 33M. P. to Nemetacum. There is no place wherethese roads can meet except Arras. In the Greektexts of Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 7) the capital of theAtrebates is Origiacum ('OptytaKov); but it issaid that the Palatine MS. has Metacon, and alt theearly editions of Ptolemy have Metacam. It seemspossible, then, that Ptolcmy*s Metacum represent;*Nemctacuin. But Ptolemy incorrectly places theAtrebates on the Seme; lie also places part of theirterritory on the sea-coast, which may be true. Ori­giacum is supposed to be Or chits, between Toumatand Douai. The town Nemetacum afterwards tookthe name of the people Atrebates or Atrebatii, andthe name was finally corrupted into^4rros. [Atre- HATEft,] The traces of the Roman roads from Arras toTherouenne and to Cambrai are said to exist. It isalso said that some remains of a temple of .Jupiterhave been discovered at Arras, on the Place duClottrt; and that there was a temple of Isis on thesito of the Hdtel-Dteu. (I)'Anville, Notice, tfc.,Walckenaer, Geoff. $c. vol. i. p. 431.) [G. L ] NEMETATAE. [Gallaecia, Vol. I. p. 933. a.] NEME'TES (Stfivrcu). This name first appearsin Caesar (B. G. i. 51), who speaks of the Nemetesas one of the Germanic tribes in the army of Ario-vistus. In another passage (fl. G. vi. 25) he de­scribes the Hercynia Silva as commencing on thewest at the borders of the Htrretii, the Nemctes,and the Rauraci; and as he does not mention theNemetes as one of the nations on the left hank ofthe Rhine (JS. G. iv. 10), wo may probably inferthat in his time they were on the cast or Germanside of the Rhine, The Vangioues and Nemeteswere afterwards transplanted to the west side of theRhine. (Tac. Germ. c. 28.) Ptolemy makes No-.viomagus (Speyer) the capital of the Nemptcs, buthe incorrectly places them north of the Vangiones.whose capital was Borbetomagus (Worms). Pliny(iv. 17) mentions the Nemetes, Tribocci. and Van­giones in this order; but Tacitus mentions themjust in the inverse order, Vangiones, Tribocci andNemetes. From none of these writers could wedetermine the relative positions of these peoples;but the fact that Noviomagns (NoirVtryos) is men­tioned by Ptolemy as the chief town of the Nemetes,and that Noviomagns is proved to be Speyer by theItinerant along the west hank of the Rhine, deter­mine the position of the Nemetes. In Ammiamw Marccllinus (xt. 11) and theNot. Imp., Noviomagus appears under the nameof the people Nemetes or Neinetae. Ammianuscalls it a mnnicipium, by which he probably meansa Roman town. In the Notitia of the Gallic pro­vinces, Civitaa Nemetum belongs to Germania Prima.In some later writings the expression occurs *' civitaaNemetum id est Spira." The name of Speyer isfrom the Speycrbach, which flows into the Rhine atSpeyer. (D'Anville. Notice, <fc.; Walckenaer, Geog.<ff. voLSL p.277.)

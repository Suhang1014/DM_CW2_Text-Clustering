OCR Output I29S VIA EGXATIA VIA EGNATIA a mere conjecture, which cannot be supported by anyauthority. We may, however, make some approxi­mation towards ascertaining the date of its con-struction, or, at all events, that of a portion of it.Strabo, in the passage cited at the head of thi.sarticle, says that Polyoma estimated the length ofthe via, between the coast of the Adriatic and thecity of Thessalonica, at 267 Human miles; whence itappears that this portion of it at least was extant intin; time of Polybius. Consequently, as that historianflourished in the first half of the 2nd century B.C,we may infer with tolerable certainty that the readmust have been commenced shortly after the reduc­tion of Macedonia by the Romans in n. c. 168.Whether the eastern portion of the road, namely,that between Thessalonica and Cypsela, a town 10miles beyond the left, or K., bank of the Hebrus,was also completed in the time of Polyoma, is ajH-int which c.nmot be so satisfactorily ascertained.For although Strabo, in the same passage, after men­tioning the length of the road, from its commence­ment to its termination at Cypsela, proceeds to saythat, if we follow Polybius, we must add 178 stadiato make up the number of Human miles, because thatwriter computed 8 stadia and 2 plethra, or 8J.stadia, to the Roman mile, instead of the usual com­putation of exactly 8; yet Strabo may then beshaking only of the historian's general practice,without any reference to this particular road. And,on the whole, it may perhaps be the more probableconclusion that the eastern portion of the road wasnot constructed till some time after the Romans hadbeen in possession of Macedonia, According to the same geographer, who is thechief authority with regard to this via, its wholelength was 535 Roman miles, or 4280 stadia; andalthough the tirst portion of it had two branches,namely, one from Kpidamnus or Dyrrachium andanother from Apollonia, yet, from whichever of thosetowns the traveller might start, the length of theroad was the same. Into the accuracy of this state­ment we shall inquire further on. Strabo also men­tions that the first part of the road was called inCamlavium (<Vl KafSoovfat), and this name fre­quently occurs in tlie Roman writers. Thus Cicero(ad Att. iii 7) speaks of.travelling "per Canda-viam," and Caesar (B. C. iii. 7'J) mentions it as thedirect route into Macedonia. It does not, however,very clearly appear to how much of the road thisname was applicable. Tal'el, who has written awork on the Via Kgnatia, is of opinion that theappellation of Candavia may be considered to extendfrom the commencement of the via, including thetwo hianches from Dyrrachinm and Apo)Ionia, to thetown of Lyehnidus. (//e \'ia mil. Rem. Egnatia,Proleg. p. xcix. Tubing. 1842.) But this limitationis entirely arbitrary, and unsupported by any au­thority; and it would perhaps be ajuster inferencefrom the words of Strabo to assume that the nameCandavia" was applicable to the road as far asThessalonica, as Col. Leake appears to have done.(Xorthtm Greece, vol. iii. p. 311.) The point tohe. determined is, what does Strabo mean by " thefirst part?" The road in its whole extent he saysis called 11 Via Egnatia," and the rirst part "inCandaviam" ('H /j.iv oOv woura 'Eyvarta jraAcrnu,H 5e irpdrri) i*\ Kai'daovtas Aiycrai, k.t. A.); andfrom what follows it is evident that he contemplatedthe division of the parts at Thessalonica, since hegives the separate measurement as far as that town,which is just half the whole length of the road. We will consider the road as far as Tbesai*cks.or the Via Candavia, first, and then proceed te *j»remainder of the Egnatian Way. Strabo (L c. andp. 326) lays down the general direction of t&* raaias follows: After passing Mount Candavia. it na lethe towns of Lyehnidus and Pylon; which last,atits name implies, was the border town fcet*»eaIllyria and Macedonia. Her.ce it proceeded b* nar-nus to Heracleia, and on through the temtorrerfu*Lynceatae and Eordaei through Edessa and PefiatiThessalonica. The whole extent of this liae. as whave already seen, was 2b7 Roman mile*; and :kacomputation will be found to a«nee pretty acrai^with the distance between Dyrrathtum ana Twt*-lonica as laid down in the Antonio* Itinerary. &r~cording to that work, as edited by Partb*T i&i1'inder (Berlin, 184S), who have paid great in*-tion to the numbers, the stations and ■zy.n- -?between those two places, starting from DyrradfcXL.were as follow (p. 151).— Clodiana - - 33 mils.

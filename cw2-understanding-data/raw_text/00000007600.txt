How­ever, he forbade Antipater and his mother to have any con­versation with Pheroras, and bid them to take care to avoid theassemblies of the women : which they promised to do ; butstill got together when occasion served, and both Pherorasand Antipater had their own merry meetings. The reportwent also, that Antipater had criminal conversation with Phe-roras's wife ; and that they were brought together by Antipater'smother. 2. But Antipater had now a suspicion of his father, and wasafraid that the effects of his hatred to him might increase : so hewrote to his friends at Rome, and bid them to send to Herod,that he would immediately send Antipater to Caesar ; which,when it was done, Herod sent Antipater thither, and sent mostnoble presents along with him ; as also his testament, whereinAntipater was appointed to be his successor : and that if Antipa­ter should die first, his [Herod Philip] son by the high-priest's,daughter should succeed.

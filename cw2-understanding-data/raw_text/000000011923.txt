OCR Output Chap. IV.] THE RULE OF THE RESTORATION, 159 was quite clear: numerous persons unfriendly for reasonsgood or bad to the government, and especially the justlyindignant mercantile order, desired nothing better than suchan opportunity of annoying the aristocracy in its mostsensitive point: he was elected to the consulship by anenormous majority, and not only so, but while, in other casesby the law of Gaius Gracchus the duty of determining thefunctions to be assigned to the consuls lay with the senate(P. 118), he was exceptionally invested by decree of thepeople with the supreme command in the African war. Accordingly he succeeded Metellus in 648; but his con 106.fident promise to do better than his predecessor and to Conflictsdeliver Jugurtha bound hand and foot with all speed at w,,11"utRome was more easily given than fulfilled.

The expedition of Marius to Capsa was an ad­venture as aimless, as that of Metellus to Thala had beenjudicious; but the expedition to the Molochath, whichpassed along the border of, if not into, the Mauretanianterritory, was directly repugnant to sound policy. KingBocchus, in whose power it lay to bring the war to an issuefavourable for the Romans or endlessly to prolong it, nowconcluded with Jugurtha a treaty, in which the latter cededto him a part of his kingdom and Bocchus promised actively

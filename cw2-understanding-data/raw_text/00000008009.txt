THESSALIA. af/yvpohtvris (//. ii. 753); though, as Leake has re-marked, the [K>et carries )iIs flattery to an extremein comparing to silver the white hue of its turbidwaters, derived entirely from the earth suspended inthem. (Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 291.) The principal rivers of Thessaly, according toHerodotus (vii, 129), are the Peneius, Apidanus,Onochonus, Enipeus and Pamisus. The four latterlivers all flow from the S. Of tiie.se the moet im­portant is the Enipeus, now called the Fersaiiti,which flows through the plain of Pharsalus, andfalls into the Peneius near Piresiae in the lowestpart of the plain. The Apidanus, now calledVryaidy into which the Cuarius (Sofadhitiko) falls,is a tributary of the Enipeus. [Enipeus.] ThePamisus, now called t he BliuH or Pilinri, alsojoin* the Peneius a little to the YV. of the Enipeus.The Onochonus, wjiicli is probably the same as theOnchestus, flows into the lake Boebeis and not intothe Peneius. [For details, see Vol. II. p. 483, a.]The chief tributary of the Peneius on the N. is theTitaresius, now culled EUusonitiko or Xeraghi, whichrises in Mt. Titarus, a part of the Cambunian range,and joins the main stream between Larissa and thevale of Tempe. Homer relates (//. ii. 753, eeq.)that the waters of the Titaresius did not mingle withthose of the Peneius, but floated upon the surface ofthe latter like oil upon water, whence it was regardedas a branch of the infernal river Styx. (Comp.Lucan, vi. 375.) Leake calls attention to the factthat Strabo (ix. p. 441), probably misled by theepithet (apyvpoS'tyrjs) applied by the poet to thePeneius, has reversed the true interpretation of thepoet's comparison of the Peneius and the Titaresius,supposing that the Peneius was the pellucid river,whereas the apparent reluctance of the Titaresius tomingle with the Peneius arises from the formerbeing clear and the latter muddy. (Northern(Jreece, iii. p. 396, iv. p. 296) The Titaresiuswas also called Eurotas (Strab. vii, p. 329) andHon us or Orcus (Plin. iv. 8. s. 15). The plain of Thessaly is the most fertile in allGreece. It produced in antiquity a large quan­tity of corn and cattle, which supported a nu­merous population in the towns, and especially arich and proud aristocracy, who were at frequentfeuds with one another and much given to luxuryand the pleasures of the table (cTrci yap 5?} irA.«i-(TTtj aTa|fa Kal a.Ko\a<rta, Plat. Crit. 15; Allien,xii. p. 564; Theopomp. ap, Atfim. vi. p. 260;Dem. Olynth, p. 16). The Thessalian horses werethe finest in Greece, and their cavalry was atall times efficient; but we rarely read of theirinfantry. The nobles, such as the Aleuadae ofLarissa and the Scopadae of Crannon, supplied thepoorer citizens with horses; but there was no classof free equal citizens, from which the hoplites weredrawn in other Grecian states. (See Grote, Hutof (irtece, vol. ii. p. 367.) Hence the political powerwas generally either in the hands of these nobles orof a single man who established himself as despot.The numerous flocks and herds of the Scopadae atCrannon are alluded to by Theocritus (/</, xvi. 3(>),and the wealth of the Thessalian nobles is fre­quently mentioned by the ancient writers. Thessaly is said to have been originally known bythe names of Pyrrha, Aemonia, and Aeolis. (Uhian.ap. Sehvl. Rhod. iii. 1089; Steph. B. s. v. Aifwtria;Herod, vii. 176.)

Thcog. 341; Ptol. iiL12. § 2, iii. 13. § 7; Miorot, Zonar. ix. 28: Sato,Turkish Kartuit), the river which constituted theboundary of Thmce and Macedonia in the time ofPhilip and Alexander, an arrangement which theRomans continued on their conquest of the lattercountry. (Strab. rii. p. 331 j'Lir. xlv. 29.) Thn-cydides (ii. 96) states that it took its rise in Mt.Scoiiiius, whence the Hebrus descended; being, infact, that cluster of great summits between Chita-tendil and S<fai, which sends tributaries to all thegreat rivers of the N. of Eunipean Turkey. Itdischarged itself into the sea near Abdera. (Herod,vii. 109; cmnp. Theoplirast. II. P. iii. 2; Leake,Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 215.) [E. B. J.] NESU'LIUM (NTjiroiiAio*), a harbour on the coastof Ctlicia. between Celenderis and Seleucia, 60 Btadiaeast of Mylac. (Stadinrmui Star. Mag. §§ 166,167.) [L.S.] NETO'PHAH (N»Ta>£«i),a town of Judah, men­tioned by Ezra (ii. 22) and Nehemiah (vii. 26), be­tween Bethlehem and Anathoth, if anything can lieconcluded from the order in which the names occur,which is so questionable, that Beit-Nettif may be,perhaps, safely regarded as its modem represen­tative. It is situated on the highest point of a loftyridge, towards the NW. of the ancient tribe ofJudah. (Robinson, Bib. Re*, vol. ii. pp. 341 —347; Roland, Paheetina. pp. 650, 909.) [O. W.] NF.TUM or NEETUM (Nrnro.., Ptol. iii. 4.§ 13; Netnm, Cic, Sil. IUl.i Eth. Netinus, Cic,Plin.: Soto Vccchio), a considerable town in the 8.of Sicily, near the sources of the little river Asi-narus (f'alconaru), and about 20 miles 8\V. of Sy­racuse. We find no mention of it in early times,but it was probably subject to Syracuse; and it isin accordance with this, that, by the treaty con­cluded in B. c. 263 between the Romans and Hieronking of Syracuse, Neetum was noticed as one of theciries left in subjection to that monarch. (Diod.xxiii. Exc. H. p. 502.) We have no account ofthe circumstances which subsequently earned forthe Netini the peculiarly privileged position in whichwe afterwards find them: but in the days of CiceroNetnm enjoyed the rights of a "foederata civitiia"like Me-ssana and Tauromenium; while, in Pliny'stime, it still retained the rank of a Latin town(ciritas iMtinae conHitvmie). a favour then enjoyedby only three cities in the island. (Cic. Verr. iv.26, v. 22, 51 ; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. I c.; Sil.Itil. xiv. 268.) Ptolemy is the last ancient writerthat mentions the name; but there is no doubt thatit continued to exist throughout the middle ages;and under the Norman kings rose to be a place ofgreat importance, and the capital of the southernprovince of Sicily, to which it gave the name ofVol di Soto. But having suffered repeatedlyfrom earthquakes, the inhabitants were induced toemigrate to a site nearer the sea, where they foundedthe modern city of A'ofo, in 1703. The old site,which is now known as Soto Yecchio, waa on thesummit of a lofty hill about 8 miles from themodem town and 12 from the sea-coast: some re­mains of the ancient amphitheatre, and of a buildingcalled a gymnasium, are still visible, and a Greekinscription, which belongs to the time of Hieron II.(Fa/rll. de Reb. Sk. iv. 2; Castell. Inter. Siril. p.101.) [E. H. B.J ■ N EllDRUS (Nttipot, Arrian, Indie, c. 4). a smallstream of the Panjtib, which flowed into tho Hy-draules {Rati or Iravati) from the country of the Attaceni. It has not been identified with any modernriver. [V.] NEVIRNUM [Novionrxr*.]XKl'RI (N«i>pol). a nomad people of the Jt. tfEurope, whom Herodotus (iv. 17, 51, 10O. Vii)places in the centre of the region which now cam-prises Poland anil Lithuania, about the rirer-tausaof the Bug. They occupied the district (ryeNfoplS* yijy) which lay to the NW. of the Uk* oatof which the Tyrus rises, and which still boars thename in Slavonic of Surtkazemja, with its chWtown Snr, and a river SwreU. Some time beforethe expedition of Dareiut, they had been obliged t*quit their original seats, on account of a quantity ofserpents with which it was infested, and had takenrefuge with the Budini in the district about theBug, which had till then belonged to that people.Though not of the same origin, in,customs theyresembled the Scythians, and bore the reputation ofbeing enchanters (•/Anns'), like the "Srhamai *among the Siberian nomads of the present day.Once a year—so the Scythians and the Greeks ofOlbia told Herodotus—each of them became for afew days a wolf; a legend which still linger* amongthe people of Volhynia and White Ruuia. Pum-ponius Mela (ii. 1. §§ 7, 13) repeats this story fromHerodotus. (Comp. Plin. viii. 34; Creuxer, Symbolit,vol. ii. p. 131.) The Sarmatian Navari of Ptolemy(Nauapoi, iii. 5. § 25) are the same as the Nrori,the name appearing in a Grecized form; but there issome difficulty in harmonising his statement*, aswell as those of Euphorus (ao. Anon. Poet. (rWyoScymn. Ch.), v. 843; Anon. I'eriiil. p. 2) and ofAmmianus Marcellinus (xxxi. 2. §14), with th*more trustworthy accounts of Herodotus. Schafank(Slav. Alt. vol. L pp. 194—199) refim the Neurito the Wendish or Servian stock. [E. B. J.] NIA (Ni'o), a river of Interior Libya, dischargingitself into the Hesperian bav, in 13" 30' E. lone- and90° N. lat. (Ptol. iv. 6. § 7). Colonel Leake (Jo*m.Gtog. Soc. vol. ii. p. 18) has identified it with theRio Grande, which takes its rise on the border uf thehighland of Senegambia, according to Mollien'• map(7'rar. in the Interior of Africa, 1820), m 10*37' N. lat. and 13° 37' W. long. [K. B. J.] NIGAE, NICE (Men), or NICAEA (NArcua),a town of Thrace, not far from Adrianopje, the trroeof the defeat and death of the emperor Valms bythe Goths in A. d. 378. (Amm. MarcelL xxxi. 13:Cedren. ii. p. 183; Sozom. iv. 19; Tbeoph. p. 771.)It has been variously identified with Kuleli araiKululeu. [T. H. D.] NICAEA. I. In Alia. 1. (Nimta;Eth. Kutiwor NiKaet'f: Iihnifc), one of the most important tnwnaof Bithynia, of which Strabo (xii. p. 565) even railsit the metropolis, waa situated on the eastern ib>»*of lake Ascania or Ascanius, in a wide and ferulaplain, which, however, was somewhat unhealthy msummer. The place is said to have been coluuisxl byBottiaeana, and to have originally bom* the msii ofAnoore (Strph. B. i. r.) or Helieore (Gengr. Jsfaa.p. 40, ed. Hudson); but it waa subsequently dnrtrmdby the Mysiana. A few years after the death ofAlexander the Great, Antigonus, probably after havictory over Eumenea, in B. a 316, rebuilt the town,and called it, after himself, Antigoneta. (Sirph. B.I. c.; Eustath. ad Horn. 1L ii. 863). Not tone afterLysimachus, having made himself master of a greatpart of Asia Minor, changed the name of Anti^ooeiainto Nirnea, in honour of bis wife Xicara, a daughterof Antipater. (Steph. B., Eustath., Sink, U. ec)

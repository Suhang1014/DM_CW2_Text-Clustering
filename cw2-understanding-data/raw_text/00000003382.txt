Twoxxxvii. sages 0f ^e laW, Ateius Capito and Antistius Labeo,adorned the peace of the Augustan age: the formerdistinguished by the favour of his sovereign; the lat足ter more illustrious by his contempt of that favour,and his stern though harmless opposition to the tyrantof Rome. Their legal studies were influenced by thevarious colours of their temper and principles. Labeowas attached to the form of the old republic; hisrival embraced the more profitable substance of therising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtieris tame and submissive; and Capito seldom presumedto deviate from the sentiments, or at least from thewords, of his predecessors: while the bold republicanpursued his independent ideas without fear of paradoxor innovations. The freedom of Labeo was enslaved,however, by the rigour of his own conclusions; and hedecided, according to the letter of the law, the samequestions which his indulgent competitor resolvedwith a latitude of equity more suitable to the commonsense and feelings of mankind. If a fair exchangehad been substituted to the payment of money, Capitostill considered the transaction as a legal sale; and heconsulted nature for, the age of puberty, without con足fining his definition to the precise period of twelve orfourteen years. This opposition of sentiments waspropagated in the writings and lessons of the twofounders; the schools of Capito and Labeo maintainedtheir inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus tothat of Hadrian; and the two sects derived their ap足pellations from Sabinus and Proculus, their most cele足brated teachers. The names of Cassiatis and Pega-sians were likewise applied to the same parties; but,by a strange reverse, the popular cause was in thehands of Pegasus, a timid slave of Domitian, whilethe favourite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius,who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin.

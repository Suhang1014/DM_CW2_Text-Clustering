OCR Output NEAPOLIS.411 NEAPOLIS. Ok gulf of Oriftano. The Itineraries place it 60miks from Sulci, and 18 from Othoca (Oristano).(/ha. Ant. p. 84.) The name would clearly seemto pint to a Greek origin, but we have no accountof its foundation or history. It is noticed by Pliny■ one of the most important towns in Sardinia; andits name is found also in Ptolemy and the Itinera­ries. (Pirn, hi. 7. s. 13; Ptol. iii. 3. § 2; ten.Ant. I c; Tab. Peat.; Geogr. Eav. v. 26.) Itsrains are still visible at the mouth of the river Pa-btikxii, where that stream forms a great estuary orlis,i)on, called the Stagno di Marceddi, and presentcvitsulerable remains of ancient bnildings as well asthe vestiges of a Roman road and aqueduct. Thespot is marked by an ancient church called Stailaria di Xabui. (De la Marmora, Voy. en Sar-imqnt, voL ii. p. 357.) The Aquae Neapoutanae, mentioned by Pto­lemy u well as in the Itinerary, which places themat a considerable distance inland, on the road fromOthoca to Caralis, are certainly the mineral sourcesbow known as the Bayni di Sardara, on the high­road from Cagliari to Oristano. (Itin. Ant. p. 82;Pud. iii. 3. § 7; Geogr. Kav. v. 26; De la Marmora,L c p. 406.) 3. A city of Apulia, not mentioned by any ancientwriter, but the existence of which is attested by itsalias. There seems good reason to place it at/Wiysano, between Barium and Egnatia, wherenumerous relics of antiquity have been discovered(Kumanelli, vol. ii. p. 148—152; Millingen, A'umiam.<k (Italic, p. 147.) [E. H. B.] 4. A town on the isthmus of Pallene, on the E.«a«t, between Aphytis and Aege. (Herod, vii. 123.)In Leake's map it is represented by the modernPttykhrono. 5. A town of Macedonia, and the haven of Phi-lippi.from which it was distant 10 M. P. (Strab. vii.p. 330; PtoL iii. 13. §9; Scymn. 685; Plin. iv.11; Hierocl.; Procop. Aed. iv. 4; /(in. Hieroiol.)It probably was the same place as Datum (Aotov),hmnoa for its gold-mines (Herod, is. 75; comp.B«±a,/>«o. A'con. of A them, pp. 8,228, trans.), and aseaport, u Strabo (vii. p. 331) intimates: whence theproverb which celebrates Datum for its " good things."(Zenob. Prov. Grate. Cent. iii. 71; Harpocrat. s. v.Airsi.) Scylax (p. 27) does, indeed, distinguishbetween Neapolis and Datum; but, as he adds thatthe latter was an Athenian colony, which could nothave been true of his original Datum, his text is,prrbaps, corrupt in this place, as in so many others,and ins real meaning may have been that Neapolis•as a colony which the Athenians had establishedat Datum. Zenobius ('. c.) and Eustathius (adiMMft. Periej. 517) both assert that Datum was aeohjoy of Tbasos; which is highly probable, as theThasiang had several colonies on this coast. IfKeapolis was a settlement of Athens, its foundationwis, it may be inferred, later than that of Amphi-poSa. At the great struggle at Philippi the galleys<rf Brotus and Cassius were moored off Neapolis.(Appian, B. C. iv. 106; Dion Cass, xlvii. 35.) It was at Neapolis, now the small Turkish villageof A'amifo (Leake, North. Greece, vol. iii. p. 180,cmp. pp. 217, 224), that Paul (Act>, xvi. 11)lauded. The shore of the mainland in this part iskm, but the mountains rise to a considerable heightb»liiud. To the W. of the channel which separates itfrom Tbasos, the coast recedes and forms a bay,within which, on a promontory with a port on eachude, the town was situated. (Conyhcare and Howson, Life and Epist. of SU Paul, vol. i. p. 308.) Tracesof paved military roads are still found, as well asremains of a great aqueduct on two tiers of Romanarches, and Latin inscriptions. (Clarke, Trav.vol. viii. p. 49.) For coins of Neapolis, see Eckhel,vol ii. p. 72; Rasche, vol. iii. pt. i. p. 1149. COIN OF NEAPOUS IN MACEDONIA. 6. A town of the Tanric Chersonesus, and afortress of Scilurus. (Strab. vii. p. 312; Bockh,Inter, vol. ii. p. 147.) Dubois de Montpcrreux( Voyage A utour da Caucase, vol. v. p. 389, vol. vi. pp.220,378) has identified this place with the ruinsfound at Kermentchik near Simplieropol. [E. B. J.]NEAPOLIS. II. In Asia. 1. An importantcity of Palaestine, commonly supposed to be identicalwith the Sichem or Shechem of the Old Testament.Thus Epiphanius uses the names as synonymous(iv Suciuuis. toot' Io-tiv iv Tp wv\ NeowdXei, adv.Haeres. lib. iii. torn. i. p. 1055, comp. 1068). Eusebiusand St. Jerome, however, place Sichem (2utfjaa,2u»tfu, 2ux«m) in the suburbs of Neapolis (Onomast.s. w. Teret/inthus, Sychem); and Luz is placed nearto, and, according to the former, viii. M. P., accordingto the latter, iii. M. P., from Neapolis (s. v. Aoufa),which would imply a considerable interval betweenthe ancient and the modern city. In order to re­concile this discrepancy, Reland suggests that, whilethe ancient city gradually decayed, the new city wasextended by gradual accretion in the opposite direc­tion, so as to widen the interval ; and he cites inillustration the parallel case of Utrecht and Veehten.(Palaestina, pp. 1004, 1005,) Another ancientname of this city occurs only in one passage ofSt. John's Gospel (iv. 5), where it is called Sichar(2ixap); for although St. Jerome maintains this tobe a corrupt reading for Sychem (Epitaph. Pauhie,Ep. lxxxvi. Op. torn. iv. p. 676, Quaest. in Genes.c xlviii. ver. 22, torn ii. p. 545), his correction ofwhat he allows was an ancient and common error,even in his age, has no authority in any known codexor version. Another of its ancient names which hasexercised the ingenuity of the learned, occurs inPliny, who reckons among the cities of Samaria,"Neapolis quod antea Mamortha dicebatur" (v. 13),evidently a mistake for Mabortha, which Josephusgives for the native name of Neapolis (B. J. iv. 8.§ 2); unless, as Reland conjectures, both readingsare to be corrected from coins, which he shrewdly re­marks are less liable to corruption than MSS., andwhich read Morthia (Mopfl(a), which that learnedwriter takes to be the classical form of the Hebrewword Moreh, which was associated with Sichem, bothin the Old Testament and the Rabbinical commen­taries. (Gen. xii. 6; Deut. xi. 30; Reland, IHsser-tationes Miscell. ]»ira L pp. 138—140.) The samewriter explains the name Sichar, in St John, as aname of reproach, contemptuously assigned to thecity by the Jews as the Beat of error (the HebrewTJS?' signifying mendacium, falsuni), and borrowedfrom the prophet Uabakkuk, where the two wordsMoreh Shaker (~\ffi iTJJD) occur in convenient

OCR Output ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. BookXIII. Now there were some of her friends who persuaded her to seizeAlexander, and to overrun and take possession of the country,and not to sit still and see such a multitude of brave Jews sub­ject to one man. But Ananias' counsel was contrary to theirs,who said, that, "she would do an unjust action, if she deprived"a man that was her ally, of that authority which belonged to"him, and this a man who is related to us; for, said he, I- would"not have thee ignorant of this, that what injustice thou dost"to him, will make all us that are Jews to be thy enemies."This desire of Ananias' Cleopatra complied with, and did noinjury to Alexander, but made a league of mutual assistancewith him, at Scythopolis, a city of Celesyria. 3.

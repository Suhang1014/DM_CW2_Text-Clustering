[T. H.

Pliny indeed seems to use the term inrestricted sense, as he speaks of "Atri-«u parade*, quae Septeni Maria appcllantur"It a. 30); but the Itinerary distinctly applies■aw to the whole extent of the lagunes fromne to Altirrnm (/im. Ant. p. 126); and Hero- "fco notices them particularly (viii. 7), clearlytii" term in the same sense. [E. II.

(Dionys. Vj.) Lirr mentions the same circumstances,tftaut giving the name of the district. (Liv. 15.)

Inter. 1026; Grnter, Inter, p. 308.3.) It isplaced by the Itinerary of Antoninus on that branchof the Klaminian Way which, quitting the main highroad at Nuceria, crossed the Apennines to Prolaqneutnand thence descended the valley of the Potentia bySeptempeda and Treia to Auximum and Ancona.(/tin. Ant. p. 312.) It early became an episcopalsee, and derives its modern name of San Severiuofrom one of its bishops who flourished in the middleages. It still retains its rank as an episcopal city,and is the capital of the surrounding city, though ithas not more than 3000 inhabitants. (Rampoldi,Ditinn. Corogr. vol. iii. p. 837.) [E. H.

Lycurg.36; Vitruv. viii. 3; Plin. xxxi. 19; /tin. Ilierosol.),the remarkable monument erected to Euripides inMacedonia, at the narrow gorge of Aulon or Arc*thusa (Besikia or Rnmili Bogkazi), where themountains close upon the road. The ancients(Vitruvius, /. c; Plin. /. c.) placed it at the con­fluence of two streams, of wliich the water of onewas poisonous, the other so sweet and health-givingthat travellers were wont to halt and take theirmeals by its currents. In the Jerusalem Itinerary,a document as lute as the 13th century, it occursas a stution between Pennana and Apollonia. (Comp.Clarke's TrareU, vol. viii. pp. 9—13.) [E. B. J.] SE'QUANA (SnKovdvai, SnuodVas, Ptol. ii. 8.§ 2), the Seine, one of the large rivers of Gallia.The Seine rises in the highlands south of Langres,but in the department of Cote a"0r, and ffows in anorthwest direction past Chatillon-sur-Stine, Troyes,Melun, Paris, Mantes, Elboeuf, Rouen, and LeHavre. It enters the Atlantic below Le Havre.The course of the Seine is about 470 miles, and thearea of its basin is about 26.000 English squaremiles, which is only one half of the area of the basinof tlte Loire. The chief branches of the Seine whichjoin it on the right bank are the Aube, the Marne,and the Oise; on the left bank, the i'vnne, the Loing,and the Eure. None of the hills which bound thebasin of the Seine, or are contained within it, have agreat elevation, and a large part of the countryincluded within this basin is level. Caesar (B. 67. i. 1) makes the Sequana and theMatrona (J/nrne) the boundary between the Celtaeand the Belgac. .Strata (iv. p. 192) says that thoSequana rises in the Alps, a statement which wemust not altogether impute to an erroneous notionof the position of the river's source, though hisknowledge of Gallia was in many respects inaccurate,but to the fact that he extended the name of Alpsfar beyond the proper limits of those mountains.But his inaccuracy is proved by his saying that ttaSequana flows parallel to the Rhine, and through thocountry of the Sequani. He is more correct in fixingits outlet in the country of the Caleti and theLexovii. The Seine was navigated in the time ofStrata and much earlier. [Galua Trassaltixa,Vol. I.] The Mtttrjna, as Ausonius names it (Mosclla,v. 462),— "Matrona non Gallos Belgasque intersita fines,' — joins the Seine a few miles above Paris; it is thelargest of the affluents of the Seine.Ainmianus Marcellinus (xv. 11) savs that the So. 3

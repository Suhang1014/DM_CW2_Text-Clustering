[L, S.] | ZAMA (Zdfxa Ptol. iv. 3. § 33), a town of Numidia, situated five days' journey to the SW.of Cart base. (Pofyb. xv. 5; Liv. xxx. 29.) It laybetween Sicca Veneris and Suffetula, and bore thename of ''Regis;" whence we find it erroneouslywritten Zainareigia in tlie Tab. Pent. Zama is par­ticularly renowned as the scene <>f Scipio's victoryover Hannibal in 201 B.C. It was a very strongplace, and hence adopted as a residence by Juba,who brought his harem and his treasure hither, asto a place of safety. (Hirt. B. Afr. 91; Vitruv.viii. 3. ("i* 4.) § 24.) Strabo represents it as de­stroyed by tlie Romans, and as being in a ruinousstate in his time (xvii. pp. 829, 831). But it musthave been subsequently restored, since Pliny (v. 4.s. 4) mentions tlie Zamense oppiduin as a free city.It also appears in the Tab, Pent., and a bishop ofZama is mentioned by St. Augustine. (Ife Civ.Del. vii. 16 ) In an inscription in Gruter (364. 1)Zama Regis appears with tlie title of a colony (Col.Aelia Hadriana); though it is not mentioned as acolony in any of the ancient writers.

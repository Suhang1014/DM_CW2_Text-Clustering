Stefano Rotondo was part of themacellum, perhaps a slaupbter-house with a dome,and surrounded with porticoes. MAURLLUM. The Caatra PEREGniSA recorded in the Notitiaare not mentioned by any author except AmmianosMarcel I inns, who relates that Chnodomar, whenconquered by Julian, was conducted to and died inthis camp on the Caelian (xvi. 12,extr.) The name,however, occurs in inscriptions, and sometimes inconnection with a temple of Jupiter Redux, as inthat found in the church of 5. Maria in Domnica(Gruter, xx'ii. 3; Orell. 1256). These inscriptionsalso mention a Piineeps Pcregrinorum, the natureof whose office we are unacquainted with; but itseems probable that he was the commander of theforeign troops stationed in this camp. Near thesame church were found several little marble ships,apparently votive offerings, and one which stooda lung while before it gave to the church and to thesurrounding place the name of d> llu Navicetla. An Isium, or temple of Isis, is mentioned byTreb. Pollio (XXX. Tyran. 25) on the Caelian, but itoccurs nowhere else. It was probably one of themany temples erected to this goddess by Carocalla(Lampr. Carac. 9.) The spring called the AquaMercurii recorded by Ovid near the Porta Oapena(Fasti, v. 67-'i) was rediscovered by M. Fea in1828, in the vigna of the Padri Camuldnlesi dtS. Gregorio. On the Caelian was also the CamplsMahTIALIS in which the E-juiria were held in March,in case the Campus Marti us was overflowed (Ovid,Fast. v. 67.'}; Paul. Diac. p. 1G1). Its .situationrests chiefly on conjecture; but it was probably nearthe Latcrun; where the neighbouring church ofS. Gregorio, now S, Maria Imperttir-ice, was calledin the middle ages "in Campo Martio" (Canina,Indicazkme. p. 84.) In the Imperial times the Caelian was the resi­dence of many distinguished Romans; and it is herethat Martial places the " hmina potentiorum" (sii.8). We have already had occasion to allude to theHouse of Claudius Centumalcs on this hill,which was of such an extraordinary height that theaugurs commanded him to lower it; but this was dur­ing the Itopublie. Under the Empire we may mentionthe HOUSE <>f MamcrrA, a Roman knight of For-miae, and praefectus fabrum of Caesar in his Gallicwars, the splendour of which is described by Pliny(xxxvi. 7). and lampooned by Catullus (xlii. 4).Here also was the Hoi'SE OF Annus Verus, thegrandfather of Marcus Aurelius, in which that em­peror was educated, situated near the house of theLaterani (Jul.Capit, M. Ant. 1.) It apj*ears to havebeen surrounded with gardens; and according to theItalian writer Vacca (Memor. 18) the noble eques- trian statue of Marcos Aurelius whichCapitol was discovered in a vineyard war tt* viiiSa?ita. On the same hill were the Actus \ kt-lianae where Com mod us sought irfur? treo tttuneasy thoughts which tormented him a *J*palace, but where he could not e*«-ape ti» vanof the assassin (Lampr.

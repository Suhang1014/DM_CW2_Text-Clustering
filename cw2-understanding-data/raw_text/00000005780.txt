OCR Output OF GREECE. i$5 The ErithrSfei (for these people contend about Herophilethe most eagerly of all the Greeks) shew a mountain called'Corycus, and in it a cavern, in which they- fay Herophilewas born. They farther add, that her parents were a shep­herd, Theodorus, a native of their country, and a nymphwho was' called Ida: and that the nymph was thus deno­minated, for no other reason than because men at thattime called places thick-planted with trees, Mai. But theErythræi do not rank among the oracles of Herophile, theverse respecting Marpeflus, and the river Aidoneus. OneHyperochus a Cumæan writes, that after Herophile awoman of Cuma belonging to the Opici, used to deliveroracles in the fame manner as Herophile, and that thiswoman was called Demo. > The Cumæans, however, cannot produce any oraclesof Demo; but they shew a stone water-pot in the templeof Apollo, in which they say the bones of this Sibyl aredeposited. After Demo, the Hebrews beyond Palsestinerank among the number of prophetic women, Sabbe,whose father they say was Berofus, and whose motherwas Erymanthe. Some, however, call this Sibyl a Baby­lonian, and others an Ægyptian. But Phaennis, who wasthe daughter of a man that reigned over the Chaones,and the Peleæ among the Dodonæans, prophesied indeedfrom a divine power, but were not denominated Sibyls.As to the age and oracles of Phaennis, the former maybe known by inquiry, and there is no difficulty in obtain­ing the latter: for she lived in those times in which An-tiochus, having taken Demetrius prisoner, seized on hiskingdom. But they fay that the Peleades were prior to Phe-monoe, and were the first women that fang these verses: "Jove was, Jove is, and tvill be, mighty Jove!Earth gives us fruits, hepee call on mother Earth."

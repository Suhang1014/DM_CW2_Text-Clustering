One of those hostages was Hyr-canus' brother; but still he broke down the fortifications thatencompassed the city: and upon these conditions Antiochusbroke up the siege and departed. 4. But Hyrcanus opened the sepulchre of David, who excel­led all other kings in riches, and took out of it three thousandtalents. He was also the first of the Jews that, relying on thiswealth, maintained foreign troops. There was also a league offriendship and mutual assistance made between them: Uponwhich Hyrcanus admitted him into the city, and furnished himwith whatsoever his army wanted in great plenty, and withgreat generosity, and marched along with him when he made anexpedition against the Parthians; of which Nicolaus of Damas­cus is a witness for us; who in his history writes thus: " When"Antiochus had erected a trophy at the river Lycus, upon his"conquest of Indates, the general of the Parthians, he stayed"there two days. It was at the desire of Hyrcanus the Jew, be-"cause it was such a festival derived to them from their fore-"fathers, whereon the law of the Jews did not allow them to"travel." And truly he did not speak falsely in saying so;for that festival, which we call Pentecost, did then fall out tobe the next day to the Sabbath: nor is it * lawful for us to jour­ney, either on the Sabbath day, or on a festival day. But whenAntiochus joined battle with Arsaces, the king of Parthia, helost a great part of his army, and was himself slain: and hisbrother Demetrius succeeded in the kingdom of Syria by thepermission of Arsaces, who freed hinvfrom his captivity, at thesame time that Antiochus attacked Parthia, as we have formerlyrelated elsewhere.

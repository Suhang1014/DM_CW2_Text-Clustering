We find one of hissayings in the Bibliotheque Orientale of M. d'Her-bclot. "The definition of humanity includes allother virtues." {73] Synesius tells this story of Carinus; and itis much more natural to understand it of Cams,than (as Petavius and Tillemont chuse to do) ofProbus. [74] Vppiscus in Hist. August, p. 250. Eutro­pius, ix. it. The two Victors. [75] To the Persian victory of Carus, I refer thedialogue of the Pbilopatris, which has so long beenan object of dispute among the learned. But toexplain and justify my opinion, would require adissertation. [76] Hist. August, p. 250. Yet Eutropius,Festus, Ruses, the two Victors, Jerome, SidoniusjApollinaris, Syncellus, and Zonaras, all ascribethe death of Carus to lightning. I77] See Nemefian. Cynegeticon, v. 71, &c. [78] See Festus and his commentators, on theword Scribonianum. Places struck with lightning,were surrounded with a wall: things were buriedwith mysterious ceremony. [79] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 250. AureliusVictor seems to believe the prediction, and to ap­prove the retreat. [80] Nemefian. Cynegeticon, v. 69. He was acontemporary, but a poet. [81] Canctllarius. This word, so hnmble inits origin, has by a singular fortune rose into thetitle of the first great office os state in the monarchiesof Europe. See Casaubon and Salmasius, ad Hist.August. j>. 253.

The reign of Dio­cletian indeed was so long and prosperous, that itmust have been very unfavourable to the fame ofCarinus. [83] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 254. He callshim Cams, but the fense is sufficiently obvious, andthe words were often confounded. [84] See Calphurnius. Eclog. vii. 43. Wemay observe, that the spectacles of Probus were stillrecent, and that the poet is seconded by thehistorian. [85] The philosopher Montaigne (E/Tats, I. Hi.6.) gives a very just and lively view of Romanmagnificence in these spectacles. [86] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 240. [87] They are called Onagri'■; but the numberis too inconsiderable for mere wild-asses. Cuper(de Elephantis Exercitat. ii. 7.) has proved fromOppian, Dion, and an anonymous Greek, thatzebras had been seen at Rome. They werebrought from some island of the ocean, perhapsMadagascar. [88] Carinus gave an hippopotamus (see Cal-phurn. Eclog. vii. 66,). In the later spectacles, £do not recollect any crocodiles, of which Augustua,once exhibited thirty-six. Dion Caffius, L lv„p. 781.

It reached almost tothe heavens, according to Calphurnius, (Eclog,vii. 23.) and surpassed the ken of human fight,according to Ammiaaus Marcellinus (xvi. 10).Yet how trifling to the great pyramid of Egypt,which rises 500 feet perpendicular. [93] According to different copies of Victor,we read 77,000, or 87,000 spectators; but Maffei(1. ii. c. 12.) finds room on the open feats for nomore than 34,000. The remainder were containedin the upper covered galleries. [94] See Maffei, 1. ii. c. 5—12. He treats thevery difficult subject with all possible clearness,and like an architect, as well as an antiquarian. [95] Calphurn. Eclog. vii. 64. 73.

But the allotments of angels, dæmons andheroes are suspended from those of the gods, and possess a morevarious distribution: for one divine allotment comprehends manyangelic allotments, and a still greater number of such as are dse-moniacaL For multitude is every where suspended from one prin­ciple. Arid as in essences, powers and energies, progression*from these generate a kindred multitude; so with respect toallotments, such as are first transcend in power, but are dimi­nished according to multitude, as being nearer the one father ofthe universe, and the one total providence which he contains;but such as are second to these possess a subordinate power, andan increased multitude.

By unrestrained government I meiaan exemption from all passivity, and from any tendency towardsor alliance with subordinate natures: for every thing divine itat the fame time every where aud no where.

But notwithstand­ing this immutability of better natures, yet in order to the propef

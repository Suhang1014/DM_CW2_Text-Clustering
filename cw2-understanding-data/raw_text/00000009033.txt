(Am. xvi. 7, 11; Jer.xlviii. 31.) In the Chaldce version and the Greek ofthe Apocrypha, it appears in the form of Kcrakka-3Iijab.and Characa (X<f,»aica,2 Mace. xii. 17). Underthis latter name, more or less corrupted, it is men­tioned by Ptolemy (XapeUaj/ia, v. 17. § 5: comp.XonMuiSi, Steph. B.) and other writers, both ecclc-fU-lical and profane, down to the centuries beforethe Crusade*. (Alm-1-l'cMa, Tab. Syr. p. 89; Schul-tens, IruJex arl Vit. Salad, s. p.) The Crusadersfound the name extant, and erected the fortress stillknown as Kerak, which, with that of Shobek, formedthe- centre of operations for the Latins E. of theJordan. With the capture of these, after a longsiege by Saladin, A. v. 1188, the dominion of theFranks over this territory terminated. (Wilken, dieKrmz, voL iv. pp. 244—247.) The whole of thisdistrict was unknown till A. t>. 1806, when Seetzen(Zachs, Monad. Corr. xviii. pp.433, foil.) penetrateda.- far as Ktrak. A fuller account of the place isgiven by Burckhardt (Trav. pp. 379—387), bywhom it was next visited in 1812; and anotherdescription is furnished by Irby and Mangles(Trac. pp. 301—370), who followed in the samedirection in 1818.

AaSixaKis,Labicanas and Ijivicanus: A^r Coltwui), an ancientc:-.t of Lutium, situated at the foot of the north-r.i>tem slope of the Alban hills, and distant about15 miles from Rome. Its foundation was ascribed,according to a tradition reported by Scrvius (adAn. vii. 796), to Glaucus, a son of Minos: andVirgil (I c.) mentions it among the cities whichtm assistance to king Latinus against Aeneas, sothst be must have regarded it as more ancient thanthe Trojan settlement in Latium. But the cur­rent tradition, adopted by Dionysius, representedLahtcuni, in common with so many other I^atinrities.i as a colony of Alba. (Dionvs. viii. 19;Dmlor. op. F.uteb. Arm. p. 185.) Whatever wasTt» origin, we know with certainty that it was one of the cities of the Latin League, and as suchretained, down to n late period, the right of par­ticipating in the sacrifices on the Alban Mount.(Dionvs. v. 61; Cic. jrroPlanc.9.) It first appearsin history as taking part in the league of the Latinsagainst Romo previous to the battle of Regillus(Dionvs. I. c), and is afterwards mentioned amongthe cities which are represented as taken in suc­cession by Coriolanus, during his campaign againstthe Romans. (Liv. ii. 39; Dionvs. viii. 19.) It isnot improbable that this legend represents the his­torical fact that Labicum, together with Bola,Pedum, and other places which figure in the samenarrative, actually fell about that time into thehands of the Aequians, as Satricum, Corioli, andother towns further to the S., did into those of theVolscians. (Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 259.) But duringthe subsequent wars of the Romans with thoAequians, Labicum always appears as a Latincity: and from its position on the frontier of La­tium adjoining the Aequians, its name repeatedlyoccurs in the history of those contests. Thus, inB. c. 458, its territory was ravaged by the Acquinngeneral Gracchus: and in 418 we find the Labicansthemselves abandoning the Roman alliance, andjoining the Aequians, together with whom theyestablished a camp on Mount Algidus. Their com­bined forces were, however, defeated by the Romandictator Q. Servilius Priscus, and Labicum itselfwas taken by storm. In order to secure their newconquest against the Aequians the Hornan senatesent thither a colony of 1500 Roman citizens, whichappears to have maintained itself there, thongh at­tacked the very next year by the Aequians. (Liv. iii.25, iv. 45—47, 49.) In n. c. 383, its territorywas again ravaged by the Praenestincs, at that timeon hostile terms with Rome (Liv. vi. 21); and aftera long interval, in B. c. 211, it once more sustainedthe same fate from the army of Hannibal. (Liv.xxvi. 9.) From this time the name of Labicum disapjiearsfrom history, but we learn that it still existed as amunicipiuin, though in a very poor and decayedcondition, in the days of Cirero. (Cic. pro fltnic.9, de Ltg. Ayr. ii. 35.) Strabo, however, speaksof the town as in ruins, and Pliny mentions thepopulation "ex agro Labicano" in a manner thatsecins to imply that, though they still formed a"populus" or community, the city no longer existed.(Strnb. v. pp. 230, 237; Plin. iii. 5. b. 9.) In likemanner we find the "ager Labicanus" elsewherementioned, but no further notice of the town. (Suet.Cats. 83.) The inhabitants teem to have, underthe Roman empire, congregated together afresh inthe neighbourhood of the station on the Via La-bicana, called Ad Quintanas, and hence assumedthe name of Lavicani QuintanenseS, which we meetwith in inscriptions. (Orell.Aiwcr. 118, 3997.) Theterritory appears to have been one of great fertility,and was noted for the excellence of its grapes. (Sil.Ital. viii. 366; Jul. Capit. Clud. Allnti. II.) The position of Labicum has been a subject ofmuch dispute, having been placed by differentwriters at Vulinontone, Zagarolu, and Lutjnano.But the precise statement of Strabo (v. p. 237) asto the course of the Via Lalmnnn, together with thefact that he describes the ancient city as situatedon a hill to the right of that road, about 120 stadia(15 Roman miles) from Rome, ought to have left nodifficulty on the subject: and Holstcniiis long agocorrectly placed the ancient city on the hill now

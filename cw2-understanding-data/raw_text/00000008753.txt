Strabo (ir. p. 193), after mentioningtitf Seqoaui and Mediomatrici as extending to theUiine, iuts, " Among them a German people hash-uled. the Trihocchi, who have passed over fromtheir native land." Pliny also (iv. 17) and Tacitus(Cmnan. c 28) say that the Tribocci are Germane.The true conclusion from Caesar is that he sup-paed the Tribocci to be settled in Gallia beforea. a 58. I'toleray (ii. 9. § 17) places the Tribocci in UpperCrmanm. but he incorrectly places the VangionesUtwera the Nemetes and the Tribocci, for the Ne-cittea bordered on the Tribocci. However he placesthe Tribocci next to the Rauraci, and he namesUreQcomagus(Brocoinagus) and Kkcbus ( Helcebus)as the two towns ot the Tribocci. D'Anville snpposeBfiat the territory of the Tribocci corresponded to thecoctMof Strtutbury. Saletio (SeM*z orSetz), we maytunp«c belonged to the Neinetes, as in moderni.'mes it belonge<l to the diocese of Speier; and it isnnirthe nurthern limits of the diocesoof Straubttrg.On the south towards tho Rauraci, a place named■VarttUkeim, on the southern limit of the diocese offtraubwg and bordering on that of Butle, indicatesa boundary by a Teutonic name (mark), as Finesdoes in those parts of Gallia where the Roman tongueprevailed. The name of the Tribocci does not appearni the Xotit- Provinc, though the names of theNVmetes and Vangiones are there; but instead of theTribocci we have Civitas Argentoratum (Stmsr-hwy), the chief place of the Tribocci. Ptolemymakes Argentoratum a citv of the Vangiones. [G.L.] TRl'BOLA (TorfdAa, App. Ilitp. 62, 63), aI- *n of Lusitania, in the mountainous regions S. ofthe Tagus, probably the modern Tretoau.

Livy (v. 34)-nDing the march of llellovesus and Ilia Galubo Italy, says they came to the Tricastini: " Thepa next were opposed to them;" from which it isrrwl that the Tricastini were near the Alps.;t nothing exact can be inferred from the narrative,'from the rat of this confuted chapter. In the description of Hannibal's march (Liv. xxi. 34) it insaid that Hannibal, after settling the disputes of theAllobroges, being now on his road to the Alps, didnot make his march straight forward, but turned tothe left into the territory of the Tricastini; and fromthe country of the Tricastini he went through theuttermost part of the territory of the Vocontii intothe country of the Tricorii, and finally reached theDruentia (Durance.) It would be out of place toexamine this qnestion fully, for it wonld requiresome pages to discuss the passages in Livy. Hemeans, however, to place the Tricastini somewherebetween the Allobroges and part of the border of theVocontlan territory. The capital of the Vocontii isDea Vocontiornm, or Die in the department ofDrome; and tbo conclusion is that tho Tricastiniwere somewhere between tbo Isara (/aire) and theDruna (Drome). This agrees with the position ofAugusta Tricastinnrum [At'OUSTA TiucAgTwo-hum] as determined by the Itins. Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 13) places the Tricastini eastof the Segallauni, whose capital is Valentia, and honames as the capital of the Tricastini a townNoeomagus, which appears to be a different placefrom Augusta Tricastinorum. D'Anville places theTricastini along the east bank of tho Rhone, northof Arausio (Orange), a position which he fixes byhis determination of Augusta Tricastinorum: and headds, "that the name .of the Tricastini has teenpreserved pure in that of Tricastin." But theTricastini of Livy and Ptolemy are certainly notwhere D'Anville places them. [G. L.] TRICCA (TptKirn: £<A. Tpuwubi: Trikkala),an ancient city of Thessaly in the district Histiaeotis,stood upon the left bank of the Peneius, and near asmall stream named Lethaeus. (Strab. ix. p. 438,xir. p. 647.) This city is said to have derived itsname from Tricca, a daughter of Peneius. (Steph.B. i. v.) It is mentioned in Homer as subject toPodaleirins and Machaon, the two sons of Asclepiuaor Aesculapius, who led the Triccaeans to the TrojanWar (Horn. /(. ii. 729, iv. 202); and it possessed atemple of Axe Ic pi us, which was regarded as the moatancient and illustrious of all the temples of this god.(Strab. ix. p. 437.) This temple was visited by tbosick, whose cures were recorded there, as in thetemples of Asclepius at Epidaurus and Cos. (Strab.viii. p. 374.) There were probably physicians at­tached to the temple; and Leake gives an inscriptionin four elegiac verses, to the memory of a " god-likephysician named Cumber, by bis wife Andromache,''which he found upon a marble in a bridge over theancient Lethaeus. (Northern Greece, vol. iv. p.28 j.) In the edict published by Polysperchon andthe other generals of Alexander, after the death ofthe latter, allowing the exiles from the differentGreek cities to return to their homes, those of Triccaand of the neighbouring town of Pharcadon wereexcepted for some reason, which is not recorded.(Diod. xviii. 56.) Tricca was the first town inThessaly at which Philip V. arrived after his defeaton the Aous. (Liv. xxxii. 13.) Tricca is alsomentioned by Liv. xxxvi. 13; Plin. iv. 8. s. 15;Ptol. iii. 13. § 44; Them. OraL xxvii. p. 333. Procopius, who calls the town Tricattus (Tpurdr-tooi). says that it waa restored by Justinian (deAtdif. iv. 3); but it is still called Tricca by Hierocles(p 642) in the sixth century, and the form in Jus­tinian may be a corruption. In the twelfth centuryit already bears its modem name (TpuxaaAa, AnnaCumn. v. p. 137, ed. Paris.; Kustath. ad IL it. |.

LYCOSURA. that Lycia enjoyed its highest degree of prosperity,ft»f under the protection of Koine the people had suf-firicnt leisure to attend to their own internal affairs.By a strict and wise neutrality, they escaped thedangers of the Mithridatic Wars as well as those ofthe wars against the pirates. (Appian, Mithrid24, 61 ; Strab. xvi. p. 665.) The prosperity ofLycia, however, received a severe blow during thewar of Brutus and Cassius, who attacked the countrybecause it was susjjected to favour the party ofOctavianus and Antony. When Brutus advancedagainst Xanthus, the inliahit.inls razed the suburbsto the ground, and offered the most determinate re­sistance. After a long and desperate siege, thesoldiers of Brutus gained admission by treachery,whereupon the Xanthians made away with them­selves by setting tire to their city. The fall ofXanthus was followed by the surrender of Pataraand the whole Lycian nation. Brutus levied enor­mous contributions, and in some instances orderedthe inhabitants to give up all their gold and silver.(Appian, B, C. iv. 60, 65, 75, &c.) Antony after­wards grunted the Lycians exemption from taxes, inconsideration of their sufferings, and exhorted themto rebuild the city of Xanthus. (Ibid. v. 7 ; comp.Dion Cass, xlvii. 34.) But after this time theprosperity of Lycia was pone, and internal dissen­sions in the end also deprived the inhabitants oftheir ancient and free constitution; for the emperorClaudius made the country a Roman province,forming part of the prefecture of Pamphylia. (WonCass. lx. 17; Suet. Claud. 25.) Pliny (v. 28)states that Lycia once contained seventy towns,but that in his time their number was reduced totwenty-six. Ptolemy (v. 3), indeed, describes Ly­cia as a separate province; but it is probable thatuntil the time of Theodosius II. it remained unitedwith Pamphylia, for an inscription (Grater, T/tesaur.p. 458. 6) mentions Portias as "procos. Lyciae etPamphyliae," and both countries had only onegovernor as late as the reign of Constantine. ButTheodosius constituted Lycia a separate province;and so it also appears in the seventh century inliteracies (p. 682. &c.), with Myra for its capital.

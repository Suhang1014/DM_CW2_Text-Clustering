[L. &.] PCNTIA or PCNTIAE (norrio: JVnai), anisland in the Tyrrhenian sea, situated off the coastof Italy, nearly <j^ite to the Circeian promontory.It is the moat considerable of a group of three smallislands, now collectively known us the J sole dtPanza; the ancient names of which were, Pai.ma-j:ia, now PaUfUtruola, the most westerly of thethree, Pontia in the centre, and Sinonia (Zimriotu)to the NK (Plin. iii. 6. a. 12; Mel. ii. 7. § 18.)They are all of volcanic origin, like the Pithecoaae(Aenaria ami Proclyta), nearer the coast of Catn-]iania, and the island of Pandataria (now railedYandottma), about midway between the. two groups.Strabo places Pontia about 250 stadia from themainland (v. p. 233). which is nearly about thetruth, if reckoned (as he does) from the coast nearCaieta; but the distance from the Ciroeian pro-montory does not exceed 1G geog. miles or 160 stadia.^Ve have no account of Pontia previous to tliesettlement of a Roman colony there in B. C. 313,except that it had been already inhabited by theYolscians. (Liv. ix. 28; Diodor. xix. 101.) Thecolonisation of an island at this distance from themainland offers a complete anomaly in the Romansystem of settlements, of which we have no explana­tion; and this is the more remarkable, because itwas not, like most of the maritime colonies, a "colo-nia maritima civium," but was a Colonia Latiua,(Liv. xxvii. 10.) Its insular situation preserved itfrom the ravages of war, and hence it was one ofthe eighteen which during the moat trying period <»lthe Second Punic War displayed its zeal and fidelityto the Roman senate, when twelve of the Latincolonies had set a contrary example. (Ibid.) Strabospeaks of it as in his time a well peopled island(v. p. 233). Under the Roman Empire it became,us well as the neighbouring Pandataria, a commonplace of confinement for state prisoners. Amongothers, it was here that Nero, the eldest son of< lermanie.us, was put to death by ortlor of Tiberius.(Suet. Tib. 54, Cat, 15.) The island of Panza is about 5 miles long, butvery narrow, and indented by irregular bays, so thatin some places it is only a few hundred yards across.The two minor islands of the group, J'almuntolit andZannone, are at the present day uninhabited.

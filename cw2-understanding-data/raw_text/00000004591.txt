OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK VIM. 45 part of the city which was possessed by the Samniles,which detachment was commanded by Lucius Quintius,military tribune. 26. In the mean time Nymphius, on his part, art­fully addressing himself to the commander of the Saro-nites, prevailed on him, as all the troops of the Ro­mans were employed either about Palaepolis, or inSamnhim, to allow him to sail round with the fleet tothe territory of Rome, where he undertook to ravagenot only the sea-coast, but the country adjoining the verycity. But in order to avoid observation, it was neces­sary, he told him, to set out by night, and to launchthe ships immediately. To effect this with the greaterdespatch, all the young Samnites, except the necessaryguards of the city, were sent to the shore. WhileNymphius wasted the time there givipg contradictoryorders, designedly to create confusion, which was in­creased by the darkness, and by the crowd, which wasso numerous as to obstruct each other's operations,Charilaus, according to the plan concerted, was ad­mitted by his associates into the city ; and having filledthe higher parts of it with Roman soldiers, he orderedthem to raise a shout; on which the Greeks, who hadreceived previous directions from their leaders, keptthemselves quiet. The Nolans fled through the oppo­site part of the town by the road leading to Nola. Theflight of the Samnites, who were shut out from thecity, was easier, but had a more disgraceful appear­ance ; for they returned to their homes without arms,stripped of their baggage, and destitute of every thing;all, in short, belonging to them being left with theirenemies ; so that they were objects of ridicule, notonly to foreigners, but even to their own countrymen.I know that there is another account of this matter,which represents the town to have been betrayed bythe Samnites ; but I have chosen to follow the writersmost worthy of credit: besides, the treaty of Neapolis,for to that place the seat of government of the Greekswas then transferred, renders it more probable that therenewal of friendship was voluntary on their side.

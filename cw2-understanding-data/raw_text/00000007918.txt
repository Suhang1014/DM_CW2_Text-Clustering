The mounds which cover thesite of Tanis are very high and of great extent,being upwards of a mile from north to south, andnearly three quarters of a mile from east to west.The arm in which the sacred enclonure of the templeof Pthah stood is about 1500 feet in length by1250 broad. The enclosure, which is of crudebrick, is 1000 feet long and about 700 wide. Agateway of granite or fine gritstone, bearing thename of Barneses the Great, stands on the northernside of this enclosure. The numerous obelisks andthe greater part of the sculptures of the templewere contributed by Ramcses. His name is alsoinscribed on two granite columns outside the en­closure, and apparently unconnected with the temple. |Though in a very ruinous condition, the fragmentsof walls, columns, and obelisks sufficiently attestthe former splendour of this building. The archi­tecture is generally in the best style of Aegyptianart, and the beauty of the lotus-bud and palm ca­pitals of the columns is much celebrated by tra­vellers. Among the deities worshipped at Taniswere Pthah (Hephaestus), Mailt, lia, Horns, &c.The Pharaohs who raised these monuments wereof various dynasties, ranging from the kings of thexviiith dynasty to the Aethiopian Tirhaka. Thenumerous remains of glass and pottery found here,and the hog* mounds of brick, prove that the civilportions of Tanis were commensurate in extent andpopulation with the religious. The modern villageof San consists of mere huts. Early in the presentcentury an attempt was made to establish nitre-works there; but they have been long abandoned;and the only occupation of the few inhabitants ofthis once flourishing city is fishing. North of thetown, and between it and the coast of the Medi­terranean, was the lake Tanis, the present Menza-kh, (Wilkinson, Mod.

It was, according to Strabo, theseat of one of the three treasuries of the kings ofPersia. It is not certain from Arrian's statementwhether lie means the town or the district, butprobably the former. The town appears to havebeen placed near the river Grants. Ptolemy speaksof a promontory and a town of this name (vi. 4.§>$ 2 and 7). It is probable that it is the sameplace as that called by Al-Edrisi, Toudj or Touj(ii. p. 391, &c). Where Dionysius (1069), enu­merating the three palaces, speaks of the Teur/cof,we ought most likely to read Twjcoi or Taxoi,with reference to the people of this district.

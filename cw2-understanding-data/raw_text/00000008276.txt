The Phoeians at one period of their historypossessed a sea-port, Daphnus, on the Euboean sea,intervening between the Locri Epicneinidii andOpuntii (Strab. x. pp. 424, 425.) Phoeis is amountainous country. The greater part of it is oc­cupied by the lofty and rugged range of Parnassus,the lower portion of which, named Cirpliis, descendsto the Corinthian gulf betweenCirrlia and Anticyra:below Cirpliis was the fertile valley of Crissa, ex­tending to the Corinthian gulf. On the XE. and E.were the Locrian mountains, lofty and difficult ofaccess on the side of the Epicneinidii, but less pre­cipitous on the side of the Opuntii. [Locris.]Between Mount Parnassus and the Locrian moun­tains flowed the river Cephissus, which empties itselfinto the kike Copais in Iioeotia. [Boeotia, p. 410,seq,] In the valley of the Cephissus are some narrowbut fertile plains. The only other rivers in Phocis,besides the Cephissus and its tributaries, an.1 thePleistus, flowing by Delphi [Delphi], and the He*racleius, flowing into the Corinthian gulf near Bulis. [Bl'LIS.] Phocis is said to have been originally inhabitedby several of those tribes who formed the populationof Greece before the ap]tearancc of the Hellenes.Ammig the earliest inhabitants we rind mention ofLeleges (Dieaearch. p. 5), Thracians (Strab. ix.p. 401; Thuc. ii. 29; comp. Pans. i. 41. § 8), andIlyantes. (Strab. /. c.) The aboriginal inhabitantswere conquered by the Phlegyae from Orchomenus.(Paus viii. 4. §4, x. 4. § 1.) The country aroundTithorea and Delphi is said to have been first calledPhocis from Phoeus, a son of Ornytion, and grandsonof Sisyphus of Corinth: and the name is said to havebeen afterwards extended to the whole country fromPhocus, a son of Aeaeus, who arrived there not longafterwards (Pans. ii. 29. § 3, x. 1. § 1.) Thisstatement would seem to show that the Phoeianswere believed to be a mixed Aeolic and Achaeanrace, as Sisyphus was one of the Aeolie heroes, anilAeaeus one of the Achaean. In the Trojan Warthe inhabitants appear under the name of Phoeians,and were led against Troy by Schedins ami Epis­tropheus, the Sims of rphitus. (Horn. Ii ii. 517.) Phocis owes its chief importance in history to thecelebrated oraele at Delphi, which originally belongedto the Phoeians. Hut after the Dorians had ob­tained possession of the temple, they disowned theirconnection with the Phoeians: and in historicaltimes a violent antipathy existed between the Pho­t-inns and Delphians. [Dklihi, p. 762.] The Phoeians proper dwelt chiefly in small townssituated upon either side of the Cephissus. Theyformed an ancient confederation, which assembled ina building named Phocicum, near Daulis. (Paus.x. 5. § 1.) They maintained their independenceagainst the Thessalians, who made several attemptsto subdue them before the Persian War, and uponone occasion they inflh ted a severe loss upon theThessalians near Hyampolis (Herod, viii. 27, seq.;Paus. x. 1.) When Xerxes invaded Greece, theThessalians were able to wreak their vengeance upontheir ancient enemies. They conducted the Persianarmy into Phocis, and twelve of the Phoc'i.in citieswere destroyed by the invaders. The inhabitantshad previously escaped to the summits of Parnassusor across the mountains into the territory of theLocri Ozulae. (Herod, viii. 32, seq.) Some of thePhuciaiis were subsequently compelled to serve in thearmy of Maidonius, but those who had taken refuge on Mt. Pamassns sallied from their fastmw nantioved the Persian army. (Herod, ix. 17, 31Pans*, x. 1. § 11.)

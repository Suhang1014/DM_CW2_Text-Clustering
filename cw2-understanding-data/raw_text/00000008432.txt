(Leake, NorthernGreece, vol. iv. p. 454, seq.) SCULTENNA (SkouAtavva, Strab.: Panaro"),a river of Gallia Cispadana, and one of the prin­cipal of the southern tributaries of the Pad us.(I'lin. iii. 16. s. 20; P. Diac. Hist. Lang. iv. 47.)Jt crosses the Aemilian Way about 5 miles E. "fMutina (Modena), and falls into the Po a little be­low Borukno, being the last of the tributaries ofthat river which now flow into its main stream.In the lower part of its course it now bears thename of Panaro, but in the upper pait, beforeit leaves the valleys of the Apennines, it is stillknown as the Scoltenna. It has its sources in oneof the loftiest and most rugged groups of the Apen­nines, at the foot of the Monte Gimme, and fromthence flows for many miles through a deep andwinding valley, which appears to have been the abodeof the Ligurian tribe of the Friniates. The districtstill bears on old maps the title of Frignano. (Ma-gini, Carte (f Italia, tav. 16.) In B.C. 177 thebatiks of the Scultenna were the scene of a decisiveconflict between the Ligurians and the Roman con­sul C. Claudius, in which the former were defeatedwith great slaughter (Liv. xli. 12, 18); but thesite of the battle is not more exactly indicated.Strabo speaks of the plains on the banks of theScultenna, probably in the lower part of its course,as producing wool of the finest quality.

Alt. iii. pt. i. p. 110). The Romanroad from Stobi to Naissus passed by Scupi, whichwas thus brought into connection with the great SE.route from Viminacium on the Danube to Byzantium.It was probably seldom under the complete authorityof Constantinople, though after the memorable vic­tory in which, under its walls, Basil, the "Slayerof the Bulgarians", in the beginning of the eleventhcentury, avenged the defeat he had suffered fromSamuel, king of Bulgaria, twenty-one years before,in the passes of Mt, Haemus, this city surrenderedto the Byzantine army (Cedren. p. 694).

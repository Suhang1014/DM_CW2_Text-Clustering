[T.H.D.] PAROPAMISADAE (n«poTra,uoTaoai or riapu-7racia-a5a(, Strab. xvi, p. 691, &c. : Diod. xvii. 82;Arrian, Anab. v. 3; Ptol. vi. IS; Paropamisii,Mela, i. 2. § 5), the collective name of a number ofsmall tribes who lived along the spurs of the greatchain of the Paropamisus (Hindu Kush), and chieflyalong its southern ami eastern sides. The dis­trict they inhabited, which was called generally■I] Uap<iTaixiud5jji' X^P^ (Arrian, Anab. v. 3), wasbounded on the W. by A nana, on the N. by Bac-triana, on the E. by the Indus and Punjab, andon the S. bv Araehosia. It comprehended thereforethe whole of Cabulistan, and a considerable portionof Afghanistan. The two principal rivers of thisdistrict were tin1 Dargamenea (now Gori) and Co-phen (Cabul river). The population appears tohave been a free independent mountain race, whonever till the time of Alexander had been compelledto submit to a foreign ruler. During the Persiandominion of Asia, as the Paropumisadae are notmentioned, it may be presumed that they remainedunsubdued. Their chief tribes were the Bolitae(perhaps Cabolitae, the inhabitants of Cabul), theAinbautae, Parsii, and Paryetae or Pargyetae(Ptol. vi. 18. § 3). Their chief towns were Orto-spauutn (Cabul), Alexandria (perhaps Bamidri),Gaiuaca, and Capissa or Caphusa. The valleysbetween the mountains, though exposed to greatcold during the winter, were very fertile. (Strab.xvi. p. 72.") ; Curt. vii. 3. i? 15.) [V.] PAROPAMISUS (o riapoira>«70S, Strab. xv.p. 689; TIapoTrdvtvos, Ptol. vi. 11. § 17 ; ria^ajrd-^laoj, Arrian, Anab. v. 4. § 5; UapuTrd^uafro^.Steph. II. s. v.; Paropamisus, Mela, i. 1">. §2; Pi in.vi. 17. p. 20). a great chain of mountains extendingfrom about 67° E. long, to 73° E. long., and along35° N. lat., and forming the connecting link betweenthe Western Caucasus and the still more easternImaus or Himalaya. Their general modern nameis Hindu Kush, but several of the most remarkablegroups have their own titles: thus the great moun­tains W. of Cabul are now called Kok-i-Baha, andthose again N. of the Cabul river in the directionof Jelhilabad bear the title of Kishadha. The altitude of these mountains, though not sogreat as that of the Himalaya, varies from 15,000to 18.000 feet, It is difficult to determine whencethe Greeks obtained the name whereby they haverecorded these mountains, or which is the bestorthography to adopt. Vet it seems not unlikelythat Ptolemy is the most correct, and that in theGreek Paropanisus we have some traces of the San-bcrit SUhadha. The ancient writers arc by no means clear intheir accounts of these mountains, and there is ajwrpetual confusion between the Taurus and theCaucasus. The reason of this no doubt is, that,till the time of Alexander's invasion they werealtogether unknown to the Greeks, and that thenthe officers who described different portions of thiscelebrated expedition sometimes considered the In­dian chain as a continuation of the Taurus, andsometimes of the Caucasus. Thus Strabo, in oneplace, states that the Macedonians called all themountains beyond Ariana eastward, Caucasus, butthat among the barbarous people they bore severallythe names of Paropamisus, Emodus, and Imaus(xi. p. 511) ; in another, he appears to consider therange which bounded India on the north to be the j extreme end of Taurus, which extrn<kd to tw, Eastern Sea (xv. p. 689). Arrian appear* to lav? thought that Taurus outfit to have b**D tbc tree| name of these, as he considers this great chaii Bextend across the whole of Asia from M- Mj i-.I which is opposite to Sainos. (Anab. v. 5.) Ii»he adds, that it was named Caucasus by tij« Mace­donian soldiers to gratify Alexander, as thvcrA Jpassing into Sogdiana through Bactriana, b-* fcJcrossed the Caucasus. Under the double run* <*Taurus and Caucasus, he states his belwi tba; Uuchain is the watershed of all the great rucrs iAsia, (f-c.) Again, in another place, be cu&^awith the description in Strabo, and a*«rU uai lieIndian names of Paropamisus, E mod as, «local titles of the extended chain of the laarat(Ind, 2.) Other ancient authors agree mot* <leas with these determinations: thus Mela fi**the whole central chain from E. to W. the raffldTaurus (i. 15, iii. 7); Curtius calls it Caocaa(vii. 3. § 19. viii. 9. § 3); Pliny, enutoeratiasseveral groups from E. to \\\, gives the m-r* aCaucasus to that portion \\\ of the i/owa £v*which connects the chain with the Carnal aaTaurus of Western Asia (vi. 17. s. 21): Pk-letfappears to have considered the Paropamisus tsiof the Caucasus (vi. 18. § 1); lastly, Polypispeaking of the Oxus, states that it derived (Iwaters from the Caucasus (x. 46. xi. 32). It fclbeen suggested that the present name of Hi*Kush is derived from Indicus Caucasus. [V.JPARU'PUS (ria^ajiros: Eth.

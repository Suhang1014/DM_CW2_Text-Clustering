B.V. to shew their high respect fdr the Lacedæmonian a!li-'ance, as they stood in great dread of the Athenians.For, considering their hostile embroilments with theAthenians, they thought it neither for their interest norsatisfaction to continue the honours of Agnon. To the Athenians they also delivered the bodies oftheir dead. The number of them, on the Athenianside, amounted to six hundred, whereas the enemy lostbut seven men. This was owing to the nature of thefight, which had not been carried on in a regularvman-ner, but was rather a Daughter, in consequence of asurprise and sudden consternation. After the receptionof cheir dead, the Athenians sailed away for Athens;but those under the orders of Clearidas applied them­selves to re-settle and secure Amphipolis. About the same time, in the close of this summer,Ramphias, and Autocharidas, and Epicydidas, Lace­dæmonians, were conducting up, for the Thracian ser­vice, a reinforcement consisting of nine hundred heavy-armed. Being arrived at Heraclea, in Trachis, theyregulated there such things as seemed to require an a-mendment; and, during the season they halted here,the battle of Amphipolis was fought, and the summerended. But, early as possible in the succeeding winter, thereinforcement under Ramphias proceeded on their routeas far as Pierium of Thessaly. But, the Thessalians op­posing their farther passage, and Brasidas being nowdead, to whom they were conducting this supply, theyreturned home. They imagined that their aid was nolonger wanting, as the Athenians, in consequence oftheir overthrow, had quitted that country, and them­selves had not sufficient ability to carry the plans intoexecution which Brasidas had been meditating. But theprincipal motive of their return was their own conscious­ness, at setting out, that the Lacedæmonians were moreinclined to peace.

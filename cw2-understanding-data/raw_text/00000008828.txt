STVRA. and all that ho could learn respecting it w.is, thatHera was formerly worshipped there in three dif­ferent sanctuaries, as virgin, wife, and widow Themodern city lay upon the southern edge of the lake,about a mile and a half from the katuvothra, andupon a rocky promontory connected with the moun­tains behind. Stymphalus is mentioned by Homer(//. ii. 608), and also by Pindar (Ol. vi. 1G9), whocalls it the mother of Arcadia. Its name does notoften occur in history, and it ow es its chief importanceto its being situated upon one of the most frequentedroutes leading to the westward from Argolis andCorinth. It was takeu by Apollonides, a general ofCassander (Diod. xix. 63), and subsequently be­longed to the Achaean League (Polyb. ii. 55, iv. 68,&c). In the time of Pausanias it was included inArgolis (viii. 22. § 1)« T lie only building of thecity, mentioned by Pausanias, was a temple of Arte-mis Styinphalia, under the roof of which were figuresof the birds Stymphalidcs; while behind the templebtood statues of white marble, representing youngwomen with the legs and thighs of birds. Thesebirds, so celebrated in mythology, the destruction ofw hich was one of the labours of Heracles (Diet, ofliiagr. Vol. II. p. 3(JG), are said by Pausanias to beas large as cranes, but resembling in form the ibis,only that they have stronger beaks, and not crookedlike those of the ibis (viii. 22. § 5). On some ofthe coins of Stymphalus, they are represented ex­actly in accordance with the description of Pau­sanias. The territory of Stymphalus is now called the valeof ZaraJcd, from a village of this name, abour a milefrom the eastern extremity of the lake. The re­mains of the city u^n the projecting cape alreadymentioned are more important than the cursorynotice of Pausanias would lead one to expect Theycover the promontory, and extend as far as thefountain, which was included in the city. On thesteepest part, which appeals from below like a sepa­rate hill, are the ruins of the polygonal walls of asmall quadrangular citadel. The circuit of the citywalls, with their round towers, may be traced. Tothe east, beneath the acropolis, are the foundationsof a temple in antU ; but the most important ruinsare those on the southern side of the hill, where arenumerous remains of buildings cut out of the rock.About ten minutes X. of Stymphalus, are the ruinsof the medieval town of Kronia (Leake, Morea,vol. iii. p. 108, seq.; Peloponnesiaca, p. 384; Bob I aye,Recherches, <fc\, p. 384 ; Koss, Reisen im Peh-po?itics, p. 54 ; Curtius, Peloponnesos, vol. i. p. 201,seq.). STYRA (t&StiVo: Kth. %Tvpevt; Stura), a townof Euboea, on the W. coast, X. of Carystus, and nearlyopposite the promontory of Cynosura iu Attica. Thetown stood near the shore in the inner part of thebay, in the middle of winch is the island Aegileia,now called Sturan'tsi. Styra is mentioned by Homeralong with Carystus (//. ii. 530). Its inhabitantswere originally Dryopians, though they denied thisorigin (Herod, viii. 46; Paus. iv. 34. § 11), andclaimed to be descended from the demu.i of Steiriain Attica. (Strab. x. p. 446 ) In the First PersianWar (b. c. 490) the Persians landed at Aegileia,winch belonged to Styra, the prisoners whom theyhad taken at Eretrifl. (Herod, vi. 107.) In theSecond Persian War (b. c. 480, 479) the StyrUnsfmghtat Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataeae. Theys-Mit two ships to the naval engagements, and atPlataeae they and the Erctrians amounted together to 600 men. (Herod, viii. 1,46,11.28: Ptas v.23. § 2.)

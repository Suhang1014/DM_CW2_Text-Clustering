(Plin. nr. 12.W.) It stretches from NW to SE., and is 15le» long according to Pliny (/. c ). or 150 stadia-rding to Scylax (p. 55). It was also called .ru^.sa ('Topowrffo, 'T&fn*<rira) from the numberlU springs, and Ophinssa because it abounded indtea. (Plin. I c.; Mela, ii. 7. § 11; Stepli. B.r ) The sons of Boreas are s.iid to have been■r. in this Island by Hercules. (Apoll. KhoJ..VM, with Schol.) In the invasion of Greece byrxrt, the Tenians were compelled to serve in the>uui fleet; but a Tenian trireme deserted to (■reeks immediately before the battle of Sa­tis (at. c 480). and accordingly the name of the.»ris waa inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi in I-a*, of Grecian statea which had overthrown thesxana. (Herod, viii. 82.) Pausanias relatest The name of the Tenians was also inscribed on ftaxov of Zeus at Olympta among the Greeks who Aught at the battle of Plataea (v. 23. § 2). Tenians afterwards formed part of the Athenian •:nie empire, and are mentioned among the sub-allies of Athens at the time of the Sicilian ex-tiax (Thuc. rii. 57). They paid a yearly. l# of 3600 drachmae, from which it may be «-d that they enjoyed a considerable share ofpmtw. (Franx, Elcm. Epigr. Or.

After the con­quest of Constairtinnple by the Latins, Tenos fell tothe share, of the Venetians, and remained in theirhands long after their other possessions in theAegaean had been taken by the Turks. It wasceiled by Venice to the Sultan by the peace of Pas-sarovitz, 1718. It is still one of the most pros­perous islands in the Aegaean, and the inhabitantsare remarkable for thoir industry and good conduct.The present population is about 15,000 souls, ofwhom more than half are Catholics, — a circum­stance which, by bringing thein into closer con­nection with western Europe, has contributed totheir pnepcrity. The ancient city of Tenia, of the. same name asthe island, stood at the south-western end upon thesame site as Si. Aico&ios, the present capital. Scy­lax says that it possessed a harbour, and Strabodescribes it as a small town. (Scyl. p. 22; Strab.x. p. 487 ; Ptol. iii. 14. § 30.) In the neighbour­hood of the city tltere was a celebrated temple ofPoseidon situated in a grove, where festivals werecelebrated, which were much frequented by all theneighbouring people. (Strab. I. c.; Tac Ann. iii.63; Clem, fro/r. p. 18; Biickh, Itucr. No. 2329.2331.) The attributes of Poseidon appear on thecoins of Tenos. There was another town in theisland named Eriston ^Hpurrov; Bockh, Jtucr.2336, 2337), which was situated in the interiorat the village of Komi. Among the curiositiesof Tenos was mentioned a fountain, the water otwhich would not mix with wine. (Athen. ii. p.43, c.) The island was celebrated in antiquityfor its fine garlic (Aristoph. 1'ltiL 18.) Thechief modern production of the island is wine,of which the best kind is the celebrated Malvasia,which now grows only at Tenos and no loncer utM<membatia in Peloponnesus, from which place itderived its name.

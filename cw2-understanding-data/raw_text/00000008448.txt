But it is te-irkable that a few years later L. Annius of Setia-wxrs is one of the leaders of the Latins in theirmt war against Rome, a. c. 340.

(Liv.tu. 9.) It was, at a later period of the war,r»T.T pinisbed for this by the imposition of muchitt contributions. (Id. xxix. 15.) From itswg and somewhat secluded position, Setia wasrr'.oi jus the place where the Carthaginian hos-Cai, given at the close of the war, were detainedcustody, and in n.«'. 198 became in consequence> wne of a very dangerous conspiracy among thet-, of that an>l the adjoining districts, which whs[(.rnvd by the energy of the praetor L.

C. i. i It appears therefore to have been at this period a strong fortress, an advantage which itowed to its position on a hill as well as to its forti­fications, the remains of which are still visible.Under the Empire Setia seems to have continued tobe a flourishing municipal town, but was chieflycelebrated for its wine, which in the days of Martialand Juvenal seems to have been esteemed one ofthe choicest and most valuable kinds: according toPliny it was Augustus who first brought it intovogue. (Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8; Martial, x. 36. 6,xiii. 112; Juv. x. 27; Strab. v. pp. 234, 237; Sil.Ital. viii. 379.) We learn from the Liber Coloniarumthat Setia received a colony under the Triumvirate;and it is probable that it subsequently bore the titleof a Colonia, though it is not mentioned as such byPliny. (Plin. iii. 5. a. 9; Lib. Colon, p. 237;Orel!. Inter. 2246; Zumpt, <fe Colon, p. 338.) The position of Setia on a lofty hill, looking downupon the Pontine Marshes and the Appian Way, isalluded to by several writers (Strab. v. p. 237;Martial,x. 74. 11, xiii. 112), among others in afragment of Lucilius (ap. A. Cell. xvi. 9), in whosetime it is probable that the highroad, of the ex­treme hilliness of which he complains, passed bySetia itself. It was, however, about 5 miles distantfrom the Appian Way, on the left hand. Therecan be no doubt that the modern town of Sezzeoccupies the same site with the ancient one, as ex­tensive remains of its walls are still visible. Theyare constructed of large polygonal or rudely squaredblocks of limestone, in the same style as those ofNurba and Cora. The substructions of severalediflces (probably temples) of a similar style ofconstruction, also remain, as well as some incon­siderable ruins of an amphitheatre. (Westphul,Jidm.

Volnmnius Flamma (Liv. x. 30, 31). Upontwo other occasions during the Samnite wars Livyspeaks of Tifernus or Tifemuin in a manner thatwould leave it uncertain whether this mountain fast­ness is meant, or a town of the same name (Liv. ix.44, x. 14); but as we have no other mention of atown of Tifernum in Samnium, it is perhaps moreprobable that in all these cases the mountain of thatname is meant. The group thus named is a part ofthat known collectively as the Monte Matese,— oneof the most conspicuous mountain masses in Sam-iiinm. [Samnium. ] The river Tifernus has ii courseof above 60 miles from its source to the Adriatic, ina general direction from SVV. to NE. In the lowerpart of its course, after leaving the confines of Sam­nium, it constituted in ancient times the boundarybetween Apulia and the Krentani. (Mel. ii. 4. § (J;Plin. iii.

Thelater capital of Armenia, built by Tigranes on aneminence by the river Kicephoritis, a city of con­siderable size and strongly fortified. It was in agreat measure populated with Greeks and Mace­donians, taken thither by force from Cappadociuand Cilicia. After Lucullos gained his victory overTigranes before its walls, he caused a great part ofthe still unfinished town to be pulled down, andpermitted its kidnapped inhabitants to return totheir homes. Nevertheless, the town continued toexist, though we hear but little of it subsequentlyto this event. (Of, Strab. It. cc. and xii. p. 539, xvi.p. 747; App. Mithr. 67; Plut. Lncull, 25, sqq.jlac.

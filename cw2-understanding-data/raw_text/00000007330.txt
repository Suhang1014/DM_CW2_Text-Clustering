WARS OF THE JEWS. 39* procurator of Galilee, and Samaria, and Perea, and removed A-grippa from Chalcis unto a greater kingdom; for he gave himthe tetrarchy which had belonged to Philip, which contained Ba-tanea, Trachonitis, and Gaulanitis: he added to it the kingdomof Lysanias, and that province [Abilene] which Varus had go­verned. But Claudius himself, when he had administered thegovernment thirteen years, eight months, and twenty days, died,and left Nero to be his successor in the empire, whom he hadadopted by his wife Agrippina's delusions, in order to be hissuccessor, although he had a son of his own, whose name wasBritannicus, by Messalina his former wife, and a daughter whosename was Octavio, whom he had married to Nero; he had alsoanother daughter by Petina, whose name was Antonio.

The disturbances which were rai­sed by the Sicarii, the magiciam, and an Eygptain false pro­phet. The Jews and Syrians have a contest at Cesarea. § 1. "^"T'OW as to the many things in whicn Nero acted like a,l,\i madman, out of the extravagant degree of the felici­ty and riches which he enjoyed, and by that means used his goodfortune to the injury of others; and after what maner he slewhis brother, and wife, and mother, from whom his barbarity spread Apostles, particularly from \iKtrcmHing when St Paul disconrwd of" righteousness," chastity, and judgment to come," Acts xxiv. 15. and no wonder, when wehave elsewhere seen, that he lived in adultery with Brasilia, another man's wife,Antiq. B. XX. ch. vii. § i. Vol. III.) in the word* of Tacitus, produced here byDean Aldrich; " Felix exercised, says Tacitus, the authority of a king, with the11 disposition of a slave, and relying upon the great power of his brother Pallas at" court, thought he might safely be guilty pf all kinds of wicked practices'" Ob­serve also the time when he was made procurator, A. D. 52, that when St Paulpleaded his cause before him, A. D. 58, he might have been " many years a judge" unto that nation'" as St Paul says he had then been, Acts Jtxiv. 10. But as towhat Tacitus here lays, that before the death of Cumanus, Felix was procuratorover Samaria only, does not well agree with St Paul's words, who would hardlyhave called Samaria a Jeiuitt nation In short, since what Tacitus here says' if a-bout countries very remote from Rome, where he lived; since what he says oftwo Roman procurators, the one over Galilee, the other over Samaria at the same«ime, is without all example else where, and since Josephus, who lived at that verylime in Judea, appears to have known nothing of this procuratorship of Felix, be­fore the death of Cumamis, T much suspect the story itself, as nothing better thana mistake of Tacitus, especially when it seems not only omitted, but contradictedby Josephs; as any one may find that compares their histoiies together. Possi­bly Felix might have been a subordinate judge among the Jews sometime beforeunder Cumanus, but that he was in earnest a procurator of Samaria before, I donot believe.

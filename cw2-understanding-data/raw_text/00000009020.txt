The prin­cipal value of these statements consists in theirestablishing the Graeco-Aegyptian character of theSaite people. The ruins of Sais consist of vast heaps of brick,mingled with fragments of granite and Syenitemarble. Of its numerous structures the positionof one only can be surmised. The lake of Sa-tl-Ifatljttr, which is still traceable, was at the back ofthe temple of Keith: but it remains for futuretravellers to determine the sites of the other sacredor civil .structures of Sais.

A river in Germany, be­tween which anil the Rhine, according to Strain)(vii, p. 291). Drasus Germanicu* lost his life.That the river was on the east of the Rhine is im­plied nlso in the account which Livy (Kpit. 140)and [Mod Caasius give of the occurrence; and it hastherefore been conjectured with some probabilitythat the Sala is the same river as the modernSaale, a tributary of the Kibe, commonly called theThuriftrjuni Saale; though others regard the Salaas identical with the Y.tsei 2. A river of Germany, alluded to by Tacitus(Ann. xiii. 57), who, without mentioning its name,calls it " rlumen gignendo sale fecundum." It formedtlit* boundary between the country of the Chatti andHeruiuiiduri and near its banks were great salt­works, about which these two tribes were perpetuallyinvolved in war. From this circumstance it is clearthat the river alluded to by Tacitus is none otherbut the Saale in Krnnconia, a tributary of the Hoc-nns or Main ; and that the salt-springs are, in allprobability, those of the modern town of Kutmgen, 3. A town in Upper Pannonia, on the road fromSabaria to Poetovium (Ptol. ii. 15. § 4: It. Ant.p. 262, where it is called Salle; Gcogr. Kav. iv.19, where it is called Sal la).

Intlie Antonine Itinerary the name occurs as Sala-conia. which has been supposed to be a corruption ofSala Colonia ; but from the Vienna MS. it appearsthat the word "coiiia" has been inserted by a laterhand.

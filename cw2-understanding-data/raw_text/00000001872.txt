XLI.> No sooner was Belisarius informed of their arrival, thanhe dispatched orders that the greatest part of the mari­ners should be immediately landed to join the triumph,and to swell the apparent numbers of the Romans.Before he allowed them to enter the gates of Carthage,he exhorted them, in a discourse worthy of himself and-the occasion, not to disgrace the glory of their arms;and to remember, that the Vandals had been the tyrants,-but that they were the deliverers of the Africans, whomust now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate,subjects of their common sovereign. The Romansmarched through the streets in close ranks, prepared forbattle if an enemy had appeared; the strict order main­tained by the general, imprinted on their minds the dutyof obedience; and in an age in which custom and impu­nity almost sanctified the abuse of conquest, the genius-of one man repressed the passions of a victorious army.The voice of menace and complaint was silent; thetrade of Carthage was not interrupted; while Africachanged her master and her government, the shops con­tinued open and busy; and the soldiers, after sufficientguards had been posted, modestly departed to the houseswhich were allotted for their reception. Belisarius fixedhis residence in the palace; seated himself on the throneof Genseric; accepted and distributed the barbaric spoil;granted their lives to the suppliant Vandals; and labour­ed to repair the damage which the suburb of Mandraciumhad sustained in the preceding night. At supper heentertained his* principal officers with the form andmagnificence of a royal banquet." The victor was re­spectfully served by the captive officers of the house- almnst as much as the works of man. The isthmus, or neck, of the city, is now con­founded with the continent; the harbour is a dry plain; and the lake, or stagnntn,no more than a morass, with six or seven feet water in the inid-channel.

"From Delphi, the name of Delphicum was given, both in Greek and Latin, to a.tripod: mid, by an easy analogy, the same appellation was extended at Rome, Con­stantinople, and Carthage, to the royal banqueltingroom.

OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 45 The senate resolved, conformably to the opinion ofManius Acilius, that the town should be secured by agarrison, and all the Tareutines confined within thewalls, and that the business should be taken underconsideration at a future time, and when Italy shouldbe in a state of greater tranquillity. The case of Mar­cus Livius, governor of the citadel of Tarentum, wasalso debated with no less warmth: some advised topass a vote of censure on him, because that, in conse­quence of his indolence, Tarentum had been betrayedto the enemy; while others thought him deserving ofreward, for having defended the citadel for five years,and for having, singly, been the principal cause of therecovery of Tarentum. Moderate people affirmedthat the cognisance of his conduct belonged to thecensors, not to the senate; and of this opinion wasFabius; nevertheless adding—' Livius was, no doubt,the cause of Tarentum being recovered, as his friendshave so often boasted in the senate; but it should beborne in mind that it could not have been recoveredif it had not been lost.' The consul, Titus QuintiusCrispinus, marched with a reinforcement into Lucania,to join the army formerly commanded by QuintnsFulvius Flaccus. Marcellus was detained by severalobstacles respecting religion, which occurred in quicksuccession to disturb his mind: one of which was, that,having in the battle with the Gauls at Clastidiumvowed a temple to Honor and Virtue, he had beenhindered by the pontiffs from dedicating it, for theyinsisted that one shrine could not with propriety beconsecrated to more than one deity; because, if itshould be struck with lightning, or any kind of pro­digy happen in it, the expiation would be difficult, asit could not be determined to which of the deities sa­crifice ought to be made; for one victim could not,properly, be offered to two divinities, unless they wereknown to be two to whom such victim must be accept­able. Wherefore a separate temple was erected toVirtue, and the work pushed forward with haste:nevertheless these temples were not dedicated by him.

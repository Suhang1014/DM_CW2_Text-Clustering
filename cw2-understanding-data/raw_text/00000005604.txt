In their haven too they have a temple ofNeptune of a moderate size, and which is built of chosenstones. The inward parts are of white plaster. The statuein this temple is of brass, is in an upright position, andstands with one of its feet on a dolphin. One of its handstoo is on its thigh, and with the other it holds a tri足dent. They have besides two gymnasia. One of thesecontains baths; and in the other, which is at some distancefrom this, and is ancient, there is a brazen statue. Theinscription on this statue signifies, that it is the image ofthe pancratiast Xenodamus the Anticyran, who was victo足rious over men in the Olympic games. If this inscriptiontherefore is true, it must follow, that Xenodamus receivedthe olive crown, in the two hundred and eleventh Olym足piad, and that the Eleans have omitted to mention himalone, in their account of the victors in the games. Abovethe forum there is a fountain of water in a well: and aroof supported by pillars screens this well from the fun.A little beyond this well there is a monument raised fromsuch stones as were accidentally found. They fay that thesons of Iphitus are buried in this tomb; that one of thesereturned safe from Troy, and died in his own house; butthat the other, Schedius, fell before Troy, and that hisbones were brought hither.

At the sametime this my importunity may effect, what you complained of mynot having done in another too forward epistle of mine; it willput upon record, and let all the world know, on what terms ofequality you live with us. You, who have had the honour of atriumph, and of the censorship, have been six times consul, andhave shared in the tribunate; and, what is still more honourable,whilst you held them in conjunction with your father, you havepresided over the equestrian order, and have been the prefect ofthe praetorians: 5 all this you have done for the service of therepublic, and at the same time, have regarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor has the extent of your prosperity produced any change inyou, except that it has given you the power of doing good to theutmost of your wishes.

How dearly do you love your brother!How admirable is your talent for poetry! What a fertility ofgenius do you possess, so as to enable you to imitate your broÂ­ther!

For the case of those who merelypublish their works is very different from that of those whoexpressly dedicate them to you. In the former case I might say, 5 The narrative of Suetonius may serve to illustrate the observation ofPliny; "Triumphavit (Titus) cum patre, censuramque gessit una. Eidemcollega et in tribunicia potestate, et in septem consularibus fuit. Recep-taque ad se prope omnium officiorum cura, cum patris nomine et epistolasipse dictaret, et edicta conscriberet, orationesque in Senatu recitaret etiamquaestoris vice, prefecturam quoque prtetorii suscepit, nunquam ad id tempus,nisi ab Equite Romano, administratum:" Valpy's ed. p. 946. 6 " Perfricui faciem;" see note in Valpy, p. 176.

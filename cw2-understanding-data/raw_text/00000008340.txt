Its territory was bounded on the north bythat of Psophis, on the south by that of Heraea, onthe west by the Eleia and Tisatis, and on the east bythat of Cleitor, Tripolis, and Theisoa. The town issaid to have derived its name from a nymph, tliedaughter of the river Ladon, which nymph was pro­bably the stream flowing through the lower part ofthe town into the Ladon. It is first mentioned inhistory in b. c. 352, when the Lacedaemonians weredefeated in its neighbourhood by tlie Spartans.(I)iod. xvi. 39.) In b. c. 222 it was taken by An-tigonus Doson, in the war against Cleomenes, anil itis also mentioned in tlie campaigns of Philip. (Po-lyh. ii. 54, iv. 60, 73, 77; Steph. B. s. v. Ts\<povaa;Plin. iv. 6. s. 20.) Its coins show that it belongedto the Achaean League. (Leake, Ptloponnesiaca,p. 206.) When Pausanias visited Thelpusa, the citywas nearly deserted, so that the agora, which wasformerly in the centre of the city, then stood at itsextremity. He saw a temple of Asclepius, and an­other of the twelve gods, of which the latter wasnearly levelled with the ground. (Pans. viii. 25§ 3.) Pausanias also mentions two temples of somecelebrity in the neighbourhood of Thelpusa, oneabove and the other below the city. The one abovewas the temple of Demeter Eleusinia, containingstatues of Demeter, Persephone and Dionysus, madeof stone, and which probably stood at the castle op-p'Mtc to Spdthari (viii. 25. §§2,3). The templebelow the city was also .sacred to Demeter, whom theThelpusians called Erinnys. This temple is alludedto by Lycophron (1038) and Callimachus (/•>. 107).It was situated at a place called Onceium, whereOticus. the son of Apollo, is said once to have reigned(viii. 25. § 4, seq.; Steph. B. s. v. "OyKuov), Belowthis temple stood the temple of Apollo Oncaeates, onthe left bank of the Ladon, and on the right bank thatof the boy Asclepius, with the sepulchre of Trygon,said to have been the nurse of Asclepius (viii. 25.J; 11). The ruins of Thelpusa stand upon the slopeof a considerable hill near the village of Vanena(Bc«'€fa). Tli'?re are only few traces of the wallsof tlie city. At the ruined church of St. John, nearthe rivulet, are some Hellenic foundations and frag­ments of columns. The saint is probably the suc­cessor of Asclepius, whese temple, as we learn fromPausanias. stood longest in the city. There are]ikewi>e the remains of a Roman building, about12 yards long and 6 wide, with the ruins of anarched roof. There are aUo near the Ladon someHellenic foundations, and the lower parts of six co­lumns. Below Vanena there stands upon the rightbank of the Ladon the ruined church ot St. A than a-sius the Miracuh-us, whore Leake found the remainsof several columns. Half a mile below this churchis the village of Tumbiki, where a promontory pro­jects into the river, upon which there is a moundapparently artificial. This mound is probably thetomb of Trygon, and Tumbiki is the bite of thethe temple of Asclepius.

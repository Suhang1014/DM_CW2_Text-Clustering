OCR Output NOTES. 3*. Perdidisseut. The subj. denoting the view of the soldier* not the sentiments of the author. 35. Nocuit. Hurt his cause, ruined his popularity. Ci.nocu-isse, 21. 36. Rigor occurs in Boettichor's list of words belonging to thepoets of an earlier age. It is not found in Cicero. Cf. Freund sub voce Ch. XIX.—3T. Ihde. Thence or next, sc. they proceeded to thesenate, of which there is an ellipsis. Tacitus in his conciseness hasput two clauses into one. Cf. note, A. 5: prima .. . approbavit;also Essay on the Style of Tacitus, p. 18. 1. Multi.... obsequlo. Al. pointed and read thus: multi vo-luntate 5 effusius qui noluerant; medii, ac plurimi, obvio obsequio.But medii is a conjectural reading; and this punctuation destroys theproper antithesis, which is usually the best clue to the understandingof Tacitus: many out of cordial good-will expressed their approbation(favebant understood) freely and fully ; those who were opposed (to thenomination), in moderate (ordinary, commonplace) tert^; and a stillgreater number (the major part) with ready complaisance, cherishinghopes of personal advantage (from Piso's elevation) without regardto the public welfare. Medie, with the exception of this one passagein Tacitus, occurs only in the brazen or post-classical age. Cf. Or. inloco and Frouud sub voce. , 7. Cum tristia sunt. Highly descriptive of the morbid state ofthe public mind.—Censuerant, had voted, sc. prior to the discussionwhich follows. 8. Agitatum secreto. By Galba among his friends and coun­sellors. 9. Jfum .... proiicisceretur. Subj. of the indirect question.Cf. Gr. 265; Z. 552.—Majore praetextu. Ut major legationis dignitaaesset et auctoritas. Ernesti. So it seems to be explained by the clausewhich follows. Praetextus in this sense (= species, auctoritas) ispost-Augustan. Cf. Boetticher. 13. Foeda Inconstantia. With shameful inconstancy (want offirmness), on the part of Galba. 1*. Ambitu. Ob ambitum, sive cupiditatem pravam gratia nix-am. So it is well explained in the Bipontine edition. Render: jrc (orthrough) their solicitous desire of going or remaining. Ch. XX.—IT. Ubl.... causa erat. Al. unde. But that is amere interpolation, and, as Wr. says, an inappropriate one; for thecause of a want of money lay in the extravagant donations of Nero,not from them. 18. Bis .... sestertium. Twenty-two hundred million sester­ces. Cf. Roman money, Gr. 327, 6. Summa ilia sane grandiuscula,Bed digna effusionibus ejus monstri. Lipsius. 19. Singulos, sc. a Nerone donatos.

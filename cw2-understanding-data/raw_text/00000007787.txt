The history of their migration fromTransalpine Gaul, their settlement in Italy, amitheir wars with the Romans, which ended in tiieextermination of the whole nation, are fully relatedunder the article Gallia Cisalpina (pp. 93b'—938). After the conquest of the Senones, and theirexpulsion from their lands on the Adriatic, twocolonies were founded in their territory, the one atSena, the other at Ariminum; and at a later periodthe remainder of their lands was portioned outamong the Roman citizens by an agrarian law ofthe tribune C. Klaminius. This district, which stillretained the name of the " Gallicus ager,"' was after­wards considered as a part of Umbria, and includedfor all administrative purposes under that appella­tion. Its topography will therefore be most con­veniently given in the article Umbria. [E. H.

(Liv. x. 27—30; Pol. ii. 19.) The scene of this decisive vic­tory, one of the most memorable in the Roman annals,is placed by Livy " in Sentinati agro but we haveno more precise clue to its position, nor do the detailsof the buttle give us any assistance. Sentinum itselfseems to have been a strong town, as in thePerusianWar it was besieged by Oetavinn himself withoutsuccess; though it was afterwards taken by surpriseby his lieutenant, Salvidienus Rufns, by whom it wasplundered and burnt to the ground. (Dion Cass,xlviii. 13.) It was subsequently revived, by receivinga body of colonists, under the Triumvirate (Lib. Col.p. 258), but did not obtain the title of a Oolouia, andcontinued under the Roman Empire to be a townof municipal rank. (Plin. iii. 14. s. 19; Strab. v.p. 227; Ptol. iii. 1. § 53; Orel!.

For in Mysia above Caicus there isa small city which is called Pioniae. They fay that thiscity was built by Pionis, who was one of the posterity ofHercules. While they are celebrating his funeral rites, asmoke rises spontaneously from the sepulchre: and of thisI have been a spectator The Thebans too exhibit thesepulchre of Tiresias, which is at the distance of abouttwenty stadia from the sepulchre of the sons of Oedipus.But they acknowledge that Tiresias died in Haliartia : theylikewise own that the sepulchre which they shew of himis merely honorary. The Thebans too have a tomb ofHector the son of Priam, near the fountain which is calledOeoi podia. For they fay that his bones were broughthither from Troy, in consequence of the following oracle:"Thebans, who inhabit the city of Cadmus, if you wish toreside in your country, blest with the posseflion of blame­less wealth, bring the bones of Hector the son of Priaminto your dominions from Asia, and reverence the heroagreeably to the mandate of Jupiter." But the fountainOedipodia was thus denominated, because Oedipus washedoff in it the blood occasioned by the murder of his father.Near this fountain is the sepulchre of Asphodicus, who,according to the Thebans, flew Parthenopæus the son ofTalaus in an engagement with the Argives. For theverses in the Thebaid, respecting the death of Partheno­pæus, assert that he was slain by Periclymenus. CHAP,

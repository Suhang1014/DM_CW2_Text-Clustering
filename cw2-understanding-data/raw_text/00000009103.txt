Appian \(Mithrid. 78, 115)speaks of it under both names, Eupatoria and Mag-nofr4is, and Strabo in one passage (xii. p. 560)(peaks of it under the name of Megalopolis. Ruinsof the place are said to exist some miles to the westof Somisa, at a place called licghaz Ilissan Kaleh.(Hamilton, Researches, i. p. 340.) [L.

Itsmodem name is C. Romania. Some have supposedthat the Prom. Magn. represents another cape,either considerably to the NW., now called C. Pa-taaa.

The period at which the Veneti acquired theRoman franchise is uncertain: we are only left toinfer that they obtained it at the same time as theTranspadane Gauls, in n. c. 49. (Dion Cass,xli. 56.) Under tbe Roman Empire, Venetia (as alreadymentioned) was included, together with Istria, inthe Tenth Region of Augustus. The land of theCarni (Carnorum regio, Plin. iii. 18. s. 22) was atthis time considered, fur administrative purposes, asa part of Venetia; though it is .still described as dis­tinct by Ptolemy (iii. 1. 25, 20): ami there is nodoubt that the two nations were originally separate.Hut as the population of both districts becamethoroughly Romanised, all traces of this distinctionwere lost, and the names of Venetia and Istria aloneremained in use. These two continued to form oneprovince, aud we meet with mention, both in inscrip­tions and in the Nolitia, of a "Corrector Venetiae etIlistriae," down to the close of the Roman Empire,(Xotit. Dign. n. p. 05; Bix-king, ad be. p. 441;Orel!. Inscr. 1050, 3191.) The capital of the unitedprovinces was Aquileia, which r<>se under the RomanEmpire to be one of the most flourishing cities ofItaly. Its importance was derived, not from its wealthand commercial prosperity only, but from its situ­ation at the very entrance of Italy, on the highroadwhich became the great means of communicationbetween the Eastern and Western Empires. Thesame circumstance led to this part of Venetia be­coming the scene of repeated contests for powerbetween rival emperors. Thus it was before Aquileiathat the Emperor Maxim in perished in A.n. 2.3$; itwas on the banks of the river Alsa (Ai\«t) that thevoum:cr Constantino was defeated and slain, in a.d.340; again, in 388, the contest between Maximusand Theodosius the Great was decided in the sameneighbourhood; and iu 425, that between theusurper Joannes and the generals of Tlieodosius II.[Aquileia.] Finally, in a. d. 489, it was on therivi-r Sontius (Isonzo) that Odoacer was defeated bythe Gothic king Theodoric. (Hist. Misctll. xvi. p.501.) It seems certain that Venetia had become underthe Roman Empire a very opulent and flourishingprovince: besides Aquileia, Patavium and Veronawere provincial cities of the first class; and manyother towns such as Concordia, Altinum, ForumJulti, &c, whose names are little known in history,were nevertheless opulent and considerable municipaltowns. Rut it suffered with peculiar severity fromthe inroads of the barbarians before the close of theEmpire. The passage across the Julian Alps fromthe valley of the Save to the plains of Aquileia, whichpresents few natural difficulties, became the high­way by which all the barbarian nations in successiondescended into the plains of Italy: and hence it wasVenetia that, felt the first brunt of their fury. Thiswas especially the case with the invasion of Attila inA. d. 452, who, having at length reduced Aquileiaafter a long siege, razed it to the ground; and then,advancing with fearful rapidity, devastated iu likemanner the cities of Concordia, Altinum, Fatavium,Vicentia, Verona, Brixia, and Bergomum, not oneof which was able to oppose any effectual resistance.{Hist. MiscelL xv. p, 549.) The expression of thechronicler that he levelled these cities with theground is probably exaggerated; but there can be nodoubt that they suffered a blow from which three ofthem at least, Concordia, Altinum, aud Aquileia,never recovered.

Valentinus: Nwagus), atown in the interior of Sardinia, HE. of Usellis. Itseems to have been a considerable place, as theValentini are one of the few names which Plinythought it worth while to mention among theSardinian towns. Ptolemy also notices the Valen­tin! among the tribes or " populi " of the island, andthere can be little doubt that the Valeria of thesum: author is only a false reading for Valentia.(Plin. iii. 12. s. 17; Ptol. iii. 3. 6, 7.) Itsremains are still visible at a village called Nitragus,near the town of Irili, about 12 miles from theruins of Usellis. The adjoining district is stillcalled Parte Vahnza.

(Plin. iii. 3. s. 4;Vib. Seq. p. 18; Itin. Ant. p. 400.) Ptolemy(/.(*.) erroneously attributes it to the ContestantIt became at a later period a Roman colony (Plin./. c), in which apparently the consul Junius Bru­tus settled the soldiers ofViriathus. (Liv. KpiLIv.) Pompey destroyed it. (Epitt. Pomp. ap.Stdhtst, ed. Corte, p. 965; cf. Plut. Pomp. 18.) Itmust, however, have been restored soon afterwards,since Mela mentions it as being still an importantplace (ii. (}), and coins of it. of u late period are pre­served. (Cf. Florez, Med. ii. p. 610, iii. p. 125;Mionnet, i. p. 55. Suppl. i. p. 110; Sestini, p. 209;Eckhel, i p. 60.) The town still bears the same name,but has few antiquities to show. [T. II.

VALE'NTIA (OitaAti'Ti'a). in Gallia Nurbonensis,a colonia in the territory of the Cavari, as Pliny says( iii. 4): but D'Anville proposes to alter the mean­ing of this passage of Pliny by placing a full stopbetween "Cavarum" and "Valentia." However,Valentia {Valence) was not in the country of theCavari, but in the territory of the Segallauni, asPtolemy (ii. 10. § 12) says, who calls it " colonia."Valence is a town on the east bank of the Rhone,a few miles below the junction of the here. In themiddle ages it was the capital of the Valentinois,and in the fifteenth century it became the seat of auniversity. [G. L.] VALENTIA, in Bmttiam.

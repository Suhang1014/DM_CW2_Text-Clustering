Such an account is incon-•im *ith the buildings which we know to havea ceded on it, as the Tabularium, and also withi praUbte attumption which we have ventured to•■yue, that a considerable part of it was occupiedBut, secondly, the accountalready pointed out, is quitentfauble with Becker's view. The Vitellians,c reptJtsd near the summit of the Clivus, retreatrvr.inb,aod attempt two other ascents, one oficfa wu by the Lucas A>yli. And this agreesA that wt gather from Livy's description of them; "Locum, qui nunc septus descendentibus * tm boas est, asylum aperit " (i. 8.) Whencefan tint the place called " inter duos lucos"ixnai the ancient asylum, the enclosure of whichIxn wu scan by thuee who descended the " inter■ law." Thirdly, the asylum must have been<tbe ippmach to it; and this, on Becker's ownwef (BmJk p. 415), was under the NE. summit,■rfr, between the career and temple of Concuni Wood the arch of Severua. This ascent hasi amaua»lj called Clivus Asyli, as there wasr «r euros on the Capitoline htlL But it isi mpmible that an ascent on this side of theavid have led to a Lucas Asyli where the Palazzo"ma iviui i now stands. It was near the asylum, * kwt seen, that the fire broke oat which de-H tfcf temple of Jupiter Capitolinas; and the eoaeqaently, must have been on the NE.ad. With leapect to the asylum, we need only further remark, tliat it contained a small temple,but to what deity it was dedicated nobody could tell ( vaov lw\ Tointp k<xtaunt vanduf-vos ■ &T(p Si &pa&fwv fj Saifioruiv oiiic fx0" '■T"fr,(* fiimy, Dionys. ii.15); and he was therefore merely called the divinityof the asylum (dun aovAatos, l'lut. Horn. 9). Another disputed point is the precise situation ofthe Ritpes Takpeia, or that part of the summitwhence criminals were hurled. The prevalent opinionamong the older topographers was that it was citherat that part of the hill which overhangs the PiazzaMontanara, that is, at the extreme S\V. point, orfarther to the W., in a court in the Via di Tor de"Specchi, where a precipitous cliff, sufficiently high tocause death by a fall from it. bears at prcseut thename of Rnpe Tarpea, That this was the trueTurpeian rock is still the prevalent opinion, and hasbeen adopted by Becker. But Dureau de la Malle(Memoire sur la Roche Tarpeienne, in the Mem. deVAcad., 1819) has pointed out two passages in Dio-nysius which are totally incompatible with this site.In describing the execution of Cassius, that historiansays that he was led to the precipice tchich overhangsthe forum, and cast down from it in the view of allHit people (toDto to rt\os rijs Siiajs \aSownjs,ayayuvTts ol rofilai rbv &y$pa M rbv {nrtptctlptvovttjj byopas KpTjfivbv, awdyrwv dpoWofP, tfipityavtcara, tt)$ vtroas, viii. 78, cf. vii. 35, seq.). Nowthis could not have taken place on the side of the ToraV Specchi, which cannot be seen from the forum;and it is therefore assumed that the true KupesTarpeia must have been on the E. side, above S.Maria della Consolaziojie. The arguments adducedby Becker to controvert this assumption are not veryconvincing. He objects that the hill is much lewprecipitous here than on the other side.

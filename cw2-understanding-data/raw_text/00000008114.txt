A continuation of thesame road, which was also included under the nameof the Via Fiaenestina, was carried from the footof the hill at Praeneste, through the subjacentplain, till it fell into the Via Latina, just belowAnaunia. The stations on it mentionedin the Antonine Itine­rary (p.302) are:— From Rome to Gabii - - - - xii. M.r.Praeneste - - - xi.Sub Anagnia - - xxiv. The Tabula gives the same distances as far asPraeneste, which are very nearly correct. Straboreckons it 100 stadia (12| miles) from Rome toGabii, and the same distance thence to Praeneste.The continuation from Praeneste to Sub Anagnia isgiven only in the Antonine Itinerary, but the dis­tance is overstated; it docs not really exceed 18miles. The Via Praenestina issued from the Porta Esqui-lina at Rome, together with the Via Labicana (Strab,v. p. 237): it passed through the Porta Praenestinain the later circuit of the walls, now called PortaMaygwre; and separated from the Via Labicana im- Imediately afterwards, striking off in a nearly directline towards Gabii. About 3 miles from Rome itpassed the imperial villa of the Gordians, the mag­nificence of which is extolled by Julius Capitol inns(Gordian. 32), and is still in some degree attestedby the imposing and picturesque ruins at a spotcalled Torre cki Schiavi. (Nibby, Dintorni, vol. iii.pp.707—710.) Nine miles from Rome the roadis carried over the valley of a small stream by aviaduct of the most massive construction, still knownas the Potite di Nona: and 3 miles farther itpasses the still existing ruins of the city of Gabii.Thence to Praeneste the line of the road was notso direct : this part of the Campagna being in­tersected by deep gullies and ravines, which necessi­tated some deviations from the straight line. Theroad is however clearly marked, and in manyplaces retains its ancient pavement of basaltic lava.It is carried nearly straight as far as a point about 5miles beyond Gabii, where it passes through a deepcutting in the tufo rock, which lias given to the spotthe name of Cavamonte : shortly afterwards it turnsabruptly to the right, leaving the village of Gallicana(the probable site of Pedum) on the left, andthence follows the line of a long narrow ridge be­tween two ravines, till it approaches the city ofPraeneste. The highroad doubtless passed onlythrough the lower part of that city. Portions of theancient pavement may be seen shortly after quittingthe southern gate {Porta del Sole), and show thatthe old road followed the same direction as themodern one, which leads through Cart and Puliuno,to an inn on tlie highroad below Anagni, apparentlyon the veiy same site as the station Sub Anagnia(or Compitum Anagninum, as it is called in anotherroute) o! the Itinerary.

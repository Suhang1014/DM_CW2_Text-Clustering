T*H E Bœotians became acquainted with this oracle, ofwhich they were before entirely ignorant, by the follow­ing means: In consequence of a great want of rain forthe space of two years, they sent Speculators from eachcity to Delphos: These, imploring a remedy against, thedrought which they laboured under, the Pythian deityordered to go to Trophonius in Lebaderij and find relieffrom him. But when they came to Lebadea, and couldnot find the oracle, one Saon an Acraiphnian, who waSthe oldest of the Speculators, happened to fee a swarmof bees, and followed them to their hive. Perceiving,therefore, that they flew into this chasm of the earth, hefollowed them, and by this means found the oracle whichhe sought. They say, that this Saon was instructed byTrophonius in all the sacred ceremonies belonging to thisoracle. Of the works of Dædalus there are two among theBœotians ; a statue of Hercules belonging to the Thebans,and of Trophonius belonging to the Lebadenscs. Thereare the fame number of wooden statues in Crete, viz.Britomartis in Olus, and Minerva among the Gnoflians.Befideu these, too, they have a representation of the danceof Ariadne, which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad;and this is made of white stone.

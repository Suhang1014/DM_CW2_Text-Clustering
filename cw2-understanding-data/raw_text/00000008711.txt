It isanally called Soias, though Pausanias gives thisname only to a building at the beginning of tirestreet, erected by Theodoras of Samos. and whichwas used even in the time of Pausanias as a placefor the assemblies of the people. Near the Sciaswas a round structure, said to have been built byKpimenides. containing statues of the Olympian/eus and Aphrodite; next came the tombs of Cv-nortaa, Castor, Idas, and Lynceus, and a temple ofCore Soleira. The other buildings along this streetor in this direction, if there was no street, were thetemple of Apdlo Cameius, who was worshippedhere before the Dorian invasion,—a statue of ApolloAplietaeus,—a quadrangular place surrounded withcolonnades, where small-wares (^tiros) were an­ciently sold,—an altar sacred to Zeus, Athena, andthe Dioscuri, all surnained Ambulii. Opposite wasthe place called Colona and the temple of DionysusColonatas. Near the Colona was the temple ofZeus Euanemus. On a neighbouring hill was thetemple of the Argive Hera, and the temple of HeraHypercheiria, containing an ancient wooden statue ofAphrodite Hera. To the right of this hill was astatue of Hetoemocles ,who had gained the victory inthe Olympic games.

Accordingly, Alexander paid them five ta­lents at Alexandria, and promised to pay them the rest of thatsum at Dicearchia [Puteoli]; and this he did out of the fear hewas in that Agrippa would soon spend it. So this Cypros sether husband free, and dismissed him to go on with his naviga­tion to Italy, while she and her children departed for Judea. 4. And now Agrippa was come to Puteoii, whence he wrotea letter to Tiberius Caesar, who then lived at Capreoe, and toldhim, that he was come so far in order to wait on him, and to payhim a visit; and desired that he would give him leave to comeover to Caprese ; so Tiberius made no'difficulty, but wrote tohim in an obliging way in other respects, and withal told him,he was glad of his safe return, and desired him to come to C*-preae ; and, when he was come, he did not fail to treat him askindly as he had promised him in his letter to do.

But, upon Agrippa's kind re­ception by Antonia, he betook himself to pay his respects toCaius, who was her grandson, and in very high reputation byreason of the good-will they bare his father f. Now there wasone Thallus, a freed-man of Caesar, of whom he borrowed amillion of drachmae, and thence repaid Antonia the debt he owedher; and by sending the overplus in paying his court to Caius,became a person of great authority with him. 5.

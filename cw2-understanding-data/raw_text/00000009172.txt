Pettt.), seems to have been aplace of some importance, us it was tlie station of theprefect of the third legion, who had to guard t he frontierfrom this town toCainpodunum. (ATof. Imp.) I'he placenow occupying the site is called W'awjen. [L. S.] VEXAFKUM (Ovtvatypov: Eth. Veu;tfrar.us:Venafro), an inland city of Campania, si matedn the upper valley of the Vultnmus. and on the ViaLatina, 16 miles from Casinum and 18 from Teanum,{Jtin. Ant. p. 303.) It was the last city of Cam­pania towards the N., its territory adjoining on theW., that of Casinum (5. Germano), which was in­cluded in Latiuni, in the more extended sense of thatname, and that of Aescrnia on the NE., which formedpart of Samnium. It sto^d on a hill rising abovethe valley of the Vulturnus, at a short distance fromthe right bank of that river. (Strab. v. p. 238.)No mention is found in history of Venafrum beforethe Itoinan conquest of this part of Italy, and it isuncertain to what people it originally belonged ■ butit is probable that it bad fallen into the bands of theSamnites before that people came into collision withRome. Under the Roman government it appears asa flourishing municipal town: Cato, the most ancientauthor by whom it is mentioned, notices it as havingmanufactures of spades, tiles, and ropes (Cato, R. R.135) : at a later period it was more noted for itsoil, which was celebrated as the best in Italy, andsupplied the choicest tables of the great at Romeunder the Empire. (Hor. Carvi. ii. fj. 16, Sat. ii.4. 69; Juv. v. S6; Martial, xiii. 98; Strab. v. pp. 238,242; Varr. R. U. i. 2. § 6; Plin. xv. 2. s. 3.) The only occasion on which Venafrum figures inhistory is during the Social War. B. c. 88, when itwas betrayed into the hands of the Saumite leaderMarius Egnatius. and two Roman cohorts that formedthe garrison were put to the sword. (Appian, B. C.i. 41.) Cicero more than once alludes to the greatfertility of its territory (Cic. de Jsg. Agr. ii. 25,pro Plane. 9), which was one of those that the tri­bune Rtillus proposed by his agrarian law to divideamong the Roman citizens. This project provedabortive, but a colony was planted at Venafrumunder Augustus, and the city continued henceforthto bear the title of a Colonia, which is found both inriiny and in inscriptions. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Lib.Col. p. 239; Zumpt, de Colon, p. 34"; Mommsen.J user. A*, y. 4043,4703.) These last, which are verynumerous, sufficiently atte.it the flourishing conditionof Venafrum under the Roman Empire: it continuedto subsist throughout the middle ages, and is still at-wn of about 4000 inhabitants. It retains the an­cient site as well as name, but has few vestiges ofantiquity, except the inscriptions above mentionedand some shapeless fragments of an edifice supposedto have been an amphitheatre. The inscriptionsare published by Mommsen. (Itiscr. R. A', pp.243—249.) [E. H. B.] VKNANTODUXUM, apparently a town of theCatyeuchlani in Britannia Rouiana, perhaps Hun-tinydon.

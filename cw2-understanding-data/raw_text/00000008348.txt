(See Yates, Tex-trinum Antiq. p. 232, note). The name of Serica,as a country, was not known before the first centuryof our era, though there are earlier accounts of thepeople called Seres. It seems highly improbable,however, that they were known to Hecataeus, andthe passage on which that assumption is foundedoccurs only in one MS. of Photius. They are firstmentioned by Ctesias (p. 371, n. 22, ed. Bahr);but according to Mela (iii. 7) they were in his timeknown to all the world by means of their commerce.On the nothern borders of their territories were themore eastern skirts of the mountains Annibi andAuxacii (the Altai), which stretched S3 far as herefrom Scythia. In the interior of the country werethe Montes Asmiraci, the western part of the Da-Urichain; and towards the southern borders the CasiiMontes (now Khara, in the desert of Gobi), togetherwith a southern branch called Tliagurus, whichtrended towards the river Bautisus(//oan£-Ao.) Onthe farther side of that river lay the Ottorocorras,the most eastern branch of the Etnodi mountains,called by Ptolemy (vi. 16. § 5) ii Xriputi Spr|.Among the rivers of the country, the same author(lb. § 3) names, in its northern part, the Oechardes(probably the Selenga), and, in the S., the Bautes orBautisus (Iloang-hv), which flowed towards theland of Sinae. Pliny, however (/. c), mentions se­veral other rivers, which seem to have been coastones, as the Psitaras, Cambari, Lanos, and Alianos,as well as the promontory of Cliryse and the bay ofCyrnaba. Serica enjoyed a serene and excellentclimate, and possessed an abundance of cattle, trees,,and fruits of all kinds (Alum. Marc, xxxiii. 6.§ 64; Plin. I. «.). Its chief product, however, wassilk, with which the inhabitants carried on a veryprofitable and most extensive commerce (Strab. xv.p. 693; Arist. Hist. Nut. v. 19; Virg. Georo. ii. 121;Plin. and Amm. II cc. &c). Pliny records (xi. 2!2.s. 26), that a Greek woman of Cos, named Pam-pbila, first invented the expedient of splitting thesesubstantial silken stuffs, and of manufacturing thosevery fine and veil-like dresses which became so cele­brated unde» the name of Coae vealcs. Both Sericaand its inhabitants are thought to have derived theirname from their staple product, since, as we learnfrom Hesychius (s. v 2ijp<s), the insect, from the webof which the brilliant stuff called holosericon wasprepared, was named Ser (2rjp). (Comp. Klaproth,Sur Us Noms de la Chine in the Mem. re/, a I'Asie,iii. p. 264; and Tableaux Hitt. d* I'Asie, pp. 57 and68.) It has been doubled, however, from the appa­rent improbability that any people should call them­selves Seres, or silkworms, whether the name of Sereswas ever really borne by any nation; and it has beenconjectured that it was merely a mercantile appella­tion by which the natives of the silk district wereknown. (Latham, in Class. Mas. vol. iii. p. 43, seq.)Lassen (/no". AIL i. p. 321) has produced from theMahabharnta, ii. 50. as the real names of the Seres,those of Caka. Tukhara, and Kanka, who are re­presented as bringing just the same goods to marketas are ascribed by Pliny (xxxiv. 14. s. 41) to theSeres, namely, wool, skins, and silk. Yet, thoughit may be allowed to bo improbable that a peopleshould have called themselves "Silkworms," yet itseems hardly less so that such an appellation shouldhave been given them by foreigners, and that theyshould have been known by it and no other far a 3 q 4

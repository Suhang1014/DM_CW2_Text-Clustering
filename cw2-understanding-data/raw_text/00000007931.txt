MELAS. mains of a Roman bath, which has also been achurch, and is sometimes used as such, though it isaaid to be generally inundated, even in the dryseason, which is in conformity with the account ofPau-sanias. The Peutinger Table specifies Melae-neae as distant 12 miles from Olympia; but it doesnot mention Heraea, though a much more importantplace, and one which continued to exist long afterHeraea: moreover, the distance of 12 miles appliesto Heraea, and not to Melaeneae. (Pans. viti. 26.§ 8, eomp. t. 7. § 1, viii. 3. § 3; Steph. B. >. r.;Plin. ir. 6. s. 10; Leake, Pelopormenaca, p. 231;Boblaye, Recherchei, <jc. p. 159; Curtius, Pelopon-nesns, vol. i. p. 356.) MELA'MBIUM (MtXaVfior), a place in Pelas-giotis in Thessaly, near Scottrssa, is mentioned inconnection with the movements of the armies beforethe battle of Cynosccphalae. Leake places it nearthe sources of the Onchestus, at a place calledDederianl. (Polyb. xviii. 3, 6; Liv. xxxiii. C;Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 473.) MELANCHLAENl (MeAa-yxAau-oi), a nomadtribe, the name of which first appears in Hecataeus(ap. Steph. B., Fr. 154, ed. Klausen). In the geo­graphy of Herodotus (iv. 20,100—103,107) they arefound occupying the districts E. of the Androphagi,and N. of the Royal Scythians, 20 days' journeyfrom the Palus Maeotis; over above them werelakes and lands unknown to man. It has been con­jectured that Herodotus may refer, through somehearsay statement, to the lakes Ladoga and Onega.Theie has been considerable discussion among geo­graphers as to the position which should bo assignedto this tribe: it is of course impossible to fix thiswith any accuracy; but there would seem to bereason to place them as far N. as the sources of thePolga, or even further. (Schafarik, Slav. Alt.vol. i. p. 295.) Herodotus expressly says that theydid not belong to the Srythian-Scolotic stock, al­though their customs were the same. The name, the"Black-cloaks," like that of their cannibal neigh­bours, the Anthropophagi, was applied to tbem bythe Greeks, and was no corrupted form of any indi­genous appellation. A people bearing this name ismentioned by Sojlax of Caryanda (p. 32) as a tribeof Pontus. Pomponius Mela (i. 19. § 4) and Pliny(vi. 5) coincide with Scylax, who speaks of tworivers flowing through their territory, the Meta-H>itis(MfroVt>f»!), probably the same as the Thes-»YRis (e«V»vpit,Ptol. v. 9. §§ 10, 30: Kamuiliar),and the AEOinos (AryiTiot: Kentichli). Diony-sius Periegetes (v. 309) places this people on theBorysthenes, and Ptolemy (v. 9. § 19) between theriver Rha and the Hippici Monies, in Asiatic Sar-niatia; but it would be a great error to found anyobservation concerning these ancient northern tribesupon either the Roman writers or Ptolemy, or toconfuse the picture set before us by these geogra­phers, and the more correct delineations of Hero­dotus. For the Melanchlaeui of Ammiamis (xxii. 8.§ 31), see Ai.asi. [E. B. J.] MKLANl)lTAE(M«Xai'o?Toi),apeople of Thrace,mentioned only by Xenophon (Anab. rii. 2. § 32). MELANGEIA. [Mantikkia, p. 264, b.] MELA'NIA (M«Ao»io), a place on the coast ofCilii ia, a little to the west of Celenderia, perhaps onthe site of the modern Kkliman. (Strab. xiv.p. 670.) From another passage of Strata (xvi.p. 760). compared with Stephanus B. («. r. Mf-Aoivai), it would seem that the place was also calledMclaenae. [L. S.J MELAXIPPE or MELANIPPIUM (MsAar»*TT»or MeAoyiTwioi*), a small town on the coast of Lycra,on the western slope of Mount Phornicus, aboal30 stadia from Cape Hieron, and 60 stadia south ofGngae, of which Leake (^trwi Minor, p. 185) talirwsit to have been the port town. (Hecat. Frngm. 247;Steph. B. s. v., who erroneouslv calls it a river; QoiaLSmym. iii. 232; Stadiam, Mar. M. §§ 210. 211.)Fellows (Itiicov. in Lycia, p. 212) found a few tonkacut out of the cliffs of the neighbourhood. [L. S.] MELANUGAETULI. [GAtmnJA.J MELA'NTHIUS (MsAorfiot), a small river «athe north coast of Pontus, forming the boundarybetween Pontus Polemoniacus and Cappadocius, andflowing into the Euxine a little to the east of Cutyora,(Plin. U. N. vi. 4; Arrian, PeripL p. 17; Aocoym.Peripl. p. 12; Tab. Petti., where it is called Ne-lantus.) It is probably the same river as tliat o*wbearing the name of JUciet Irmalc (Hamilton, Ke-tearcha, i. p. 267.) [L. S.] MELANTIAS (MeAoirtai), a village of Thrace,on the river Athyras, and on the road from Hrnu Irato Byzantium, 18 miles from the latter. (/(. Ami.pp. 138, 230, 323, 332; Ammian. xixi. II;Agath. v. p. 158.) [A. L-] MELA'NTII SCO'PULI (MeAaVvio. omrrsAW),some rocks in the Aegaean sea, where Apulia ap­peared to the Argonauts, probably lay between leanaand Myconus. (Strab. xiv. p. 636; A poll. KluLiv. 1707; Scyl. p. 55; Hesych. t. r.; Apullod.Lt.§ 26; Stadiam. §S 252, 270.) MELAS (Me'Aat), the name of several rivers, »called from the dark colour of their water. 1. A small river of Arcadia or Achilla, describedby Dionysius as flowing from Mount Erymantkaa.(I)ionys. Per. 416; Callim. in Jor. 23.) Strata(viii. p. 386) confounds it with the Prirua or Piemsin Achaia; but the reading is probably eomiiL[Achaia, p. 14, a.] 2. A river of Botiitia. [Bokotia, p. 413, a.] 3. A river of Malis. which in the time of Herodivtus flowed into the Maliac gulf, at the distance uf 5stadia from Trachis. It is now called the ifarro-Neria, and falls into the Spereheius, after aniline !'«waters with the Gurgo (Dyras), which also n<*A t»flow in ancient times into the Maliac gulf (Herod,vii. 198; Strab. ix. p. 428; Liv. xxxvi. 22; Leake,Northern Greece, voL ii. p. 26.) 4. A river of Phthiotis in Thessaly, and a tribo-tary of the Apidanus. (Lucan, vi. 374; Vib. Seqa.de Flum. t. v. Apidanot; Leake, Sorlhtm Crwca,vol. iv. p. 515.) 5. A river of Thrace, now called Saldatti t*Scheher-Su, falling into a deep bay of the samename (Mc'Aai koAvos), which is bounded on theeast by the shore of the Thracian CherV»ne>ua. It-*modem name of the bay is the gulf of Soros.(Herod, vi. 41, vii. 58, 198; Strab. vii. p. Ml;Liv. xxxiii. 40; Ptolein.ui. 11. §§ 1,2; UeU,ii.2;Plin. iv. 11. s. 18.) MELAS (M«Aoj). 1. A small river of Cappa-docia, which had its sources on Mount Alcanas(Ptol. v. 6. § 8), and flowed in a nonh-«e>:erodirection past the town of Maiaca, frequently over­flow-in;* its hanks and forming marshes. (Strab. xii.p. 5.18, &c.) It emptied itself into the river Hairs,oppubile the town of Siva. Strata (Ac-) erroneouslydescribes the Melas as a tributary of Uw Kuphratsa,as has been shown by Hamilton in the Jomml ••/the Geogr. Society, vol. viiL p. 149 (oxnp. his Kf-marches, ii. p. 259, &C.).

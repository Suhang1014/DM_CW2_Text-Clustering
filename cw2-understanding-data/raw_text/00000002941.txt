So Herod being desirous toshow Archelaus' ill-will to him, called for Alexander, as hewas in his bonds, and asked him again concerning his flight,whither and how they had resolved to retire? Alexander re­plied, "To Archelaus, who had promised to send them away"to Rome, but that they had no wicked nor mischievous de-"signs against their father, and that nothing of that nature'' which their adversaries had charged upon them was true;"and that their desire was, that he might have examined Ty-"rannus, and Jucundus, more strictly, but that they had been"suddenly slain by the means of Antipater, who put his own"friends among the multitude [for that purpose]." 7.

The latter,enclosing an area inure than twice as large as thatdetent led by the Servian walls, betokened the capitalof a large .state, which, after becoming the mistressof the world, was beginning to totter under the weightof its own greatness, and found itself compelled toreport to the same means of defence which had pro­tected its infancy — no longer, however, to ward offthe attacks of its immediate neighbours, but those ofthe remotest tribes of Asia and Kurope. Thus thehistory of tho city,during this jieriod of eight centu­ries, reflects in some degree the history of the Bom inpeople, and exhibits the varying fortunes of thegreatest of all human empires. Unfortunately, how­ever, the materials even for a slight sketch of sovast a subject and so long a period are scanty andinadequate; nor, even were they more abundant,would our present limits allow more than an attemptto draw such an outline us may serve to illustratethe topography of the city. Tarquin the Frond, the last of the Roman kings,seems to have effected little fur the city, except bycompleting or improving the works of his prede­cessors. Of these the most important was thetemple of the Capituline Jove, the description ofwhich will be found in the second part of this article.The expulsion of the Tarquins (u. c. 510) restoredto the Human people the use of ttic Campus Martins.This ground, which from the earliest times hadprobably been sacred to Mars (Dionys. v. 13), hadbeen appropriated by the Tarquins, and at the timeof their expulsion was covered with the crops whichthey had sown. The unholy nature of this propertyprevented its distribution among the people, likethat uf the other royal goods. The corn was orderedto be cut down and thruwn into the Tiber; and ac­cording to the legend its quantity was so great thatit caused the island afterwards known as the InsulaTiberina, <<r that of Aesculapius. (Liv. ii. 0; Dio­nys. I.e. Hut. Pull 8.) The defeat of the Ktruscans under Aruns, whohad esj>oused the royal cause, was, according to theusual principle of the Romans of incorporating thevanquished nations, the means of adding a freshsupply of citizen?, as there will be occasion to relatein another place. We have little or nothing to record respecting thehistory of the city from this period till its captureby the Cauls n. c. 390. After the fatal battle atthe Allia, the Humans returned dispirited. Thecity, together with the older inhabitants, was aban­doned to its fate; many families escaped to Veii andother neighbouring towns ; whilst the men of anage to bear arms occupied the Capitol, which theyprepared todefeud. The flight of the Vestal virgins,who succeeded in escaping to Caere, is connected witha topographical legend. Being unable to carry awayall their sacred utensils, they buried some of themin ca-ks (tloliotis), in a chapel near the house of theFlanien O.uirhuhs ; whence the place, which seemsto have been near the Cloaca Maxima, in the ForumItoariutn, obtained the name of Doliola, and washeld so sacred that it was forbidden to spit upon it.(Liv. v.40;Val. M ix. i. 1. § 10.) Varro, however(/./v. v. § 157, Mull.), did not recognise this story,but attributed the name either to some bones havingbeen deposited there, or to the burial at an earlierperiod of some sacred objects belonging to Numal*ompilius. ihe Cauls entered the city unopposed, and tnroogl the open Porta Collin*.

TAAXACII (Beya* and Qavadx), a town inPalestine, not far from Megiddo, with which it isgenerally mentioned, was originally one of the royalcities of the Canaanitcs, (Josh. xii. 21; Jtidges, v.19; 1 Kings,lv. 12.) It was assigned to Maimssch(Josh. xvii. 11), but was afterwards one of thecities given to the Levites. (Josh. xxi. 25.)"Tannach by the waters of Megiddo" was thescene of the great battle of Deborah and Barak.(Judges, v. 19.) In the time uf the Judges theCanaanitish inhabitants still remained in Taanach(Judges, i. 27), but in the reign of Solomon it ap­pears as an Israclitish town. (1 Kings, iv. 12.)Eusebius describes it as 3 Roman miles, and Jeromeas 4 Roman miles from Legio, which is undoubtedlythe Megiddo of Scripture, [Lkgio.] Taauach Ustill called Ta'annmk, a village standing on the slopeof the hills which skirt the plain of Esdraelon to­wards the south. (Robinson, ISibi Jits. vol. ii. p. 316,vol. iii. p. 117, 2nd ed.; Stanley, Sinai and I'alts-tine, p. 331.) TABAE (Toffoi: Eth. TaSrjvSs), a town which, ac­cording to Strabo (xii. p. 570),waa situated on the eon-tines between Phrygia and Caria, and which, in anotherpassage (p. 576), he evidently includes in Phrygia.The country was situated in a plain which derivedfrom the town the name of n*oi'ur TaStjv6v. (Strab.xii. p. 576.) S:ephanus Byz. (*. r.) on the otherhand calls Tabae a Lydian town, though he at thesame time mentions another in Curia; hut it is highlyprobable that not only both are one and the sametown, but also the same as the one assigned byStrabo to Phrygia, and that in point of fact the townwas in Caria near the confines of Phrygia. Mythi­cally the name of the place was derived from a heroTabus, while others connected it with an Asiaticterm rdSa, which signified a rock. (Steph. It. I. c.)The latter etymology is not inconsistent with Stralm'saccount, for though the town is described an beingin a plain, it. or at least a part of it, may have beenbuilt on a rock. The plain contained beveral otherlittle towns besides Tabae. Livy (xxxviii. 13). in hisaccount of the expedition of Maulius, states that hemarched in three days from Gordiutichos to Tabae. Itmust then have been a considerable place, for, havingprovoked the hostility of the Romans, it was orderedto pay 20 talents of silver and furnish 10,000medimni of wheat. Livy remarks that it stood o:ithe borders of Pisidia towards the shore of thePamphylian sea. There can be no doubt thatD'Anville i* correct in identifying the modernThaous or Davos, a place of some note north-eastof MtHjIfihy with the ancient Tabae. Col.

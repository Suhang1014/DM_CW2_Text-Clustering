OCR Output liv On his Qualifications as a Historian. As to the Roman Historians, who saw what these mightyoriginals had done before them, I cannot judge it fair to formdecisive parallels. Time had enabled them to judge maturelyabout the defects and excellencies of their Greek predeces­sors. Yet every Roman historian shews plainly he is a Romanhimself; he stood not so aloof from his subject as Thucy-dides. The loss of a Peloponnesian writer is never regrettedin regard to the latter; the loss of Carthagenian and histo­rians of other nations is highly regretted in regard to theformer.

In the Sublime, as in great affluence of fortune," some minuter articles will unavoidably escape observation." But it is impossible for a low and grovelling genius to be" guilty of error, since he never endangers himself by soaring" on high, or aiming at eminence, but still goes on in the same" uniform secure track, whilst its very height and grandeur• Longinus, Section 33.

(.Strab. ix. p. 435.)Leske supposes the KhoUj to be the Cuarius, andplaces itonus near the spot where the river issuesfrom the mountains ; and as, in that case, Iton pos­sessed a portion of the jastoral highlands of Othrys,th« epithet " mother of flocks" api*"ars to have beenwell adapted to it. (Leake, Northern Greece, vol.iv. pp. 356, 357.) Iton had a celebrated temple ofAUwna, whose worship, under the name of theItonian Athena, was carried by the Boeotians, whenthey were expelled from Thessaly, into the countrymined after them. (Strab.

Itsur.babk site, in the opinion of Ukert, was betweenM'irtoi and Espejo, near Valenzncla. (Ukert, vol.ii. pt. 1. p. 369 ; Coins, tip.

Ant. xv. 10. § 1.)The name is «o loosely applied by the ancient writersthat it is difficult to fix its boundaries with precision,bat it may be said roughly to be traversed by a linedrawn from the Lake of Tiberias to Damascus. Itw« a mountainous district, and full of caverns(."trab. I.e.): the inhabitants, a wild race (Cic/'AtV.ii.24). favoured by the natural features of the country,were in the habit of robbing the traders from Da­mascus (Strab. xvi. p. 756), and were famed asarchers. (Virg. Georg. ii. 448 ; Lucan.vii. 230, 514.)At an early period it was occupied by the tribe ofJetur {\Ckron. v. 19; "iToopoTot, LXX.), whose nameii connected with that of Jetur, a son of Ishmael.(1 Ckron. i. 31.) The Ituraeans — either the de-wendanta of the original possessor, or, as is moreprobable, of new comers, who had occupied thisdistrict after the exile, and assumed the original name—were eventually subdued by king Aristobulus, B.C.100. who compelled them to be circumcised, andiaarporated them in his dominions. (Joseph. Ant.xUi. 11. §3.) The mountain district was in theland* of Ptolcmaeus, tetrarch of Chalcis (Strab. xvi.p.753); but when Poinjfeius came into Syria, Ituracawas ceded to the Romans (Appian. Mitltr. 106),though probably it retained a certain amount ofimpendence under native vassal princes: M. An-toehu imposed a heavy tribute upon it. (Appian,K. C. r. 7.) Finally, under Claudius, it becamepari of the province of Syria. (Tac Ann. xii. 23;I>v«i Cms. lix. 12.) The district EUDjedur, to theE. of Hermon (lijtbtl rih-Schrikh), and lying W. oftie Uadj road, which according to Burckuardl (Trav. p. 286) now contains only twenty inhabitedvillages, comprehended the whole or the greaterpart of ancient Ituraea.

Jlela does not mention theplace by either of these names; but, after speakingof Carteia, he adds the following remarkable words:et quam transrecti ex Africa Phoenices habitant,atqtte wide no* gumus, Tinffentera, (Mela, ii. 0.)It can hardly be doubled that all these statementsrefer to the same place; nay, the very names arcidentical, Traiwbicto, being only the Latin trans­lation of the word Joza (from nV\ egretsus est)used by the Phoenician inhabitants to describe theorigin of the city.

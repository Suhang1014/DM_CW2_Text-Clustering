OCR Output HOC TARSUS. TARTESSIS was the chief city of Cilkia, and one of the mostimportant places in all Asia Minor. It was situatedin a most fertile and productive plain, on both sidesof the river Cydnus, which, at a distance of 70 stadiafrom the city, flowed into a lagoon called Rhegma orRliegmi. This lagoon formed tlie port of Tarsus,and was connected with the sea. The situation ofthe city was most favourable, for the river wasnavigable up to Tarsus, and several of the mostimportant roads of Cilkia met there. Its foundationis ascribed to Sardanapalus, the Assyrian kin?, andthe very name of the city seems to indicate itsSemitic origin. But the Greeks claimed the honourof having colonised the place at a very early period;and, among the many stories related by them aboutthe colonisation of Tarsus, the one adopted by Strabo(xiv. p. 673; comp. Steph. B. s. p.) ascribes thefoundation to Argives who with Triptolemus arrivedthere in search of Io. The first really historicalmention of Tarsus occurs in the Anabasis of Xe-nophon, who describes it as a great and wealthycity, situated in an extensive and fertile plain atthe foot of the passes of Mount Taurus leading intoCappadocia and Lycaonia. {Anab. i. 2. § 23, &e.)The city then contained the palace of Syennesis,king of Cilkia, but virtually a satrap of Persia, andnil equivocal ally of Cyrus when he marched againsthis brorher Artaxerxcs. When Cyrus arrived atTarsus, the city was for a time given up to plunder,the troops of Cyrus being exasperated at the losssustained by a detachment of Cilicians in crossingthe mountains. Cyrus then concluded a treaty withSyennesis, and remained at Tarsus for 20 days. Inthe time of Alexander we no longer hear of kings;but a Persian satrap resided at Tarsus, who fledbefore the young conqueror and left the city, whichsurrendered to the Macedonians without resistance.Alexander himself was detained there in consequenceof a dangerous fever brought on by bathing in theCydnus. (Arrian, Anab. ii. 4; Curt, iii, 5.) Afterthe time of Alexander, Tarsus with the rest of Ciliciabelonged to the empire of the Seleucidac, exceptduring the short period when it was connected withEgypt under the second and third Ptolemy. Pompeydelivered Tarsus and Cilicia from the dominion ofthe eastern despots, by making the country a Romanprovince. Notwithstanding this, Tarsus in the warbetween Caesar and Pompey sided with the former,who on this account honoured it with a per­sonal visit, in consequence of which the Tarsiauschanged the name of their city into Juliopolis. (Caes.Ii. Alex. 66; Dion Cass, xlvii. 24; Klor. iv. 2.)Cassius afterwards punished the city for this attach­ment to Caesar by ordering it to be plundered, butM. Antony rewarded it with municipal freedom andexemption from taxes. It is well known how Antonyreceived Cleopatra at Tarsus when that queen sailedup the Cydnus in a magnificent vessel in the disguiseof Aphrodite. Augustus subsequently increased thefavours previously bestowed upon Tarsus, which oncoins is called a '' libera eivitas." During the firstcenturies of the empire Tarsus was a place of greatimportance to the Romans in their campaigns againstthe J'arthians and lVr.->iaiis. The emperor Tacitus,his brother Klorian, and Maximinus and Julian diedat Tarsus, and Julian was buried in one of its sub­urbs. It continued to be an opulent town until ittell into the hands of the Saracens. It was, how­ever, taken from them in the second half of the 10thcentury by the emperor Nicephorus, but was soonafter again restored to them, and has remained in I their hands ever since.

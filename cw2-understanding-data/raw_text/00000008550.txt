In the lower part of its course it entersthe territory of the Frentani, which it traverses inits whole breadth, flowing into the sea between Ilis-toniam and Ortona. Strabo indeed represents it asfanning the boundary between the Frentani and thePeligni, but this is certainly a mistake, as the Pe-Ugni did not in fact descend to the sea-coast at all,and Ortona, one of the chief towns of the Frentani,was situated to the N. of the Sagrns.

Ii. $, r.), a town of the Kdetani or Sedetani inHiapania Tanuconenais, seated on an eminence onthe banks of the river Pal hint ias, between Sucroand Tarraco, and not far from the sea. Strabo(iii. p. 159) erroneously places it near the mouth ofthe Lbenia, though it lies near 100 miles to theSW. of it. The same author states that it wasfounded by Greeks from Zaeynthus; and we findthat Steplianui calls it Za*avOa and ZdtevvSos.Livy adds that the founders were mixed with Ituttilifrom Ardea (Liv, xxi. 7); whence we sometimesfind the city called Ausonia Saguntus. (Sil. Ital.i. 332.) Another tradition ascribed its foundationto Hercules, (lb. 263, 505.) Saguntum lay in avery fertile district (l'olyb. xvii. 2), and attained togreat wealth by means of its commerce. It wasthe immediate cause of the Second Punic War,from its In-jug besieged by Hannibal when it wa>in the alliance of the Romans* The siege is me­morable in history. The town was taken, aftera desperate resistance, in ii. c 218, and all theadult males put to the sword; but how long thesiege lasted is uncertain. (Liv. xxi. 14, 13 ; Cf.Sil. Ital. i. 271, aeq.) Kiirht years afterwardsSaguntum was recovered by the Romans. TheCarthaginians bad partly destroyed it, and had usedit as a place for the custody of their hostages.(Polvb. iii. 98; Liv. xxiv. 42.) The city was re­stored by the Kotnans and made a Koman colony.(Liv. x.wiii. 39; Plin. iii. 3. s. 4.) Snguntmn wasfamous for its manufacture of earthenware cups(calicos Saguntini) (Plin. xxxv. 12. s. 46; Mart,iv. 4(>, xiv. 108), and the fiu's grown in the neigh­bourhood were considered very fine.

Ix. 29; AureL Vict. Cats. 4, Epit. 4;Oros. vii. G; Am in. Marc. xvii. 7; Georg. Cedren.i. p. 1*J7, ed. Par.) Moreover Pliny himself, inanother passage (iv. 12. s. 23), says that Tbia ap­peared in our age ("in nostru aevo"), which canhardly apply lo the consulship of Si lan us and Balboa,since he was not born till a.j>. 2.'i. In a. i>. 726, during the reign of Leo the [saurian,Hiera,or the Palaea Kammeni, received an augmenta­tion i»n the NK. side. (Theoph. Chronogr. \>. 33S,ed. Paris.; Cedren. i. p. 454, ed. Paris.; Nicephor.p. 37. ed. Par.) There have lieen several eruptionsin modem times, of which a full account is given byLieut. Leyce.ter and Ross. Of these one of the mostimportant was in 1573, when the Mikra Kammeniis said to have been formed. But as we have alreadyseen from several authorities that an island wasformed in the reign of Claudius, a.1>. 46, we mustsuppose either that the last-mentioned island sunkintti the sea at some unknown period, ami made itsappearance a second time as the Mikra Kammeni in1573. or that there was only an augmentation ofthe Mikra Kammeni in this year. The latter sup­position is the mure probable, especially since Fatherliichard, who records it, was not an eye-witness, butderived his information from old people in the island.There was another terrible eruption in 1650, whichFather Richard himself saw. It broke out at anentirely different spot from all preceding eruptions,outside the gulf, off the NK. coast of Thera, about<\\ miles from C. Kulumbo, in the direction of Iosand Anydros. This submarine outbreak lasted aboutthree months, covering the sea with pumice, andgiving rise to a shoal, winch was found by theEnglish Survey to have 10 fathoms water over it.(See map, A.) At the same time the island ofThera was violently shaken by earthquakes, in whichmany houses were overthrown, and a great numberof (H.-rsons and animals were killed by the pestilentialvajHjurs emit Led from the volcano. The sea inundatedthe Hat eastern coast of the island to the extent oftwo Italian miles inland. The ruins of two ancienttowns at Peri&$a and Kamari were disinterred, theexistence of which was previously unknown, andwhich must have been overwhelmed by some pluviouseruption of volcanic matter. The road also, whichthen existed round Cape Mes&a-Yoiuio, was sunkbeneath the witters. For the next 50 years, or a little longer, the vol­canic, fires slept, but in 1707 they burst forth withredoubled fury, and produced the largest of the threeburnt islands, the Aeo Kammeni. It originally con­sisted of two islands. The first which rose was calledthe White Island, composed of a mass of pumice ex­tremely porous. A few days alter wards there ap-peared a large chain of dark rocks, composed ofbrown trachyte, to which the name of the BlackIsland was given. These two islands were graduallyunited; atid in the course of the eruptions, the blackrocks became the centre ol the actual island, the-Vta Kammini. The White Island was first seen>i:i the 23rd of May, 1707. and for a year the dis-rharges of the volcano were incessant. After thistime the eruptions were less frequent; but they con­tinued to occur at intervals in 1710 and 1711; andit was not till 1712 that the fires of the volcanobecame extinct. The island is now about "1\ milesill circuit; and has a perfect cone at its SK. side, 1 \ which is 351 feet high. From 1712 fan lo tiepresent day there has been nn further ercpLac.

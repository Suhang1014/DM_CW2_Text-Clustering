All the four quarters of the city, the Island,Achradina, Tycha, and Neapolis, were still well in­habited; though as a measure of precaution no per­sons of native Syracusan extraction were permitted todwell in the Island. (/&. v. 32.) But the pros­perity of Syracuse seems to have sustained a severeshock in the time of Scxtus Pompeius, who, accord­ing to Strabo, inflicted upon it injuries, from whichit appears never to have recovered. Such was itsdecayed condition that Augustus endeavoured torecruit it by sending thither a Roman colony (n. c.21). But the new settlers were confined to theIsland and to the part of the city immediatelyadjoining it, forming a portion only of Achradinaand Neapolis. (Strab. vi. p. 270; Dion Cass. liv. 7;1'lin. iii. 8. s. 14.) It is in this part of the townthat the amphitheatre and other edifices of Romanconstruction arc still found. liut though greatly fallen from its former splen­dour, Syracuse continued throughout the RomanEmpire to be one of the most considerable cities ofSicily, and still finds a place in the 4th century inthe Ordo Nobilium Urbiuin of Ausonius. The na­tural strength of the Island as a fortress rendered italways a post of the utmost importance. After the fallof the Western Empire, it fell with the rest of Sicilyunder the dominion of the Goths, hut was recoveredby Belisarius in A. i>. 535, and annexed to the do-ininions of the Byzantine emperors, in whose handsit continued till the 9th century, when it was finallywreMed from them by the Arabs or Saracens. Sy­racuse was, with the single exception of Taurome-niuin, the last place in Sicily that fell into the handsof those invaders: it was still a very strong fortress,and it was not till 878, more than fifty years afterthe Saracens first landed in the island, that it wascompelled to surrender, after a siege of nine months'duration. The inhabitants were put to the sword,the fortifications destroyed, and the city given up tothe flames. Nor did it ever recover from this ca­lamity, though the Island seems to have alwayscontinued to be inhabited. Its fortifications were(strengthened by Charles V., and assumed very muchtheir present appearance. The modern city, whichis still confined to the narrow limits of the Island,contains about 14.000 inhabitants. But the wholeof the expanse on the opposite side of the strait, asweil as the broad table-land of Achradina and Epi-polae, are now wholly bare and desolate, being ingreat part uncultivated as well as uninhabited. III. Topoorapiiv.The topographical description of Syracuse as itexisted in the days of its greatness cannot better beintroduced than in the words of Cicero, who hasdescribed it in unusual detail. "You have oftenheard (says he) that Syracuse was the largest ofall Greek cities, and the most beautiful of all cities.And it is so indeed. For it is both strong by itsnatural situation and striking to behold, from what­ever side it is approached, whether by laud or sea.It has two ports, as it were, enclosed within thebuildings of the city itself, so as to combine with itfrom every point of view, which have different andseparate entrances, but are united and conjoinedtogether at the opposite extremity. The junctionof these, separates from the mainland the part ofthe town which is called the Inland, but this is re­united to the continent by a bridge across the nar­ row strait which divides them. fsi jr^at i- tbtthat it may be said to con^st of fair cities. *them of very large size; one of whi>:h L> tin: ratiI have already mentioned, the Uland, which l-rounded by the two ports, while it prnieca te»v4>the month and entrance of each of tbm. hasthe palace of king Hieron. winch is r^w lb*tornary residence of our praetors.

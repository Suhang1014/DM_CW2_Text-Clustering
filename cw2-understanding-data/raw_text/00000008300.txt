Lycophron was supported by Sparta;and Medina accordingly applied for succour to theconfederacy of Greek states which had been latelyformed to resist tlie Lacedaemonian power. Withtheir assistance Merlins took Pharsalus, which wasthen occupied by ;i Lacedaemonian garrison, and isKaid to have sold all its inhabitants as slaves.(Diod. xiv. 82.) The return of Agesilaus, and hisvictory over the Tnessalians, probably deprived Me-dius anil his party of their power, and Larissa nolonger appears as the rival of l'herae for the supre­macy of Thessaly, Pharsalus soon recovered fromllie blow which it had received from Med i us, andhpcame, next to Pherae, the most imporlaut city inThessaly. The inhabitants of Pharsalus agreed toentrust the supreme power to Polydamaa, one oftheir own citizens, in whose integrity and abilitiesall parties placed the greatest confidence. Theacropolis and the whole management of the financeswere placed in bis hands, and lie discharged histrust to the satisfaction of all parties. (Xcn. Udl.vi. 1. §§ 2,3.) Meantime the supreme power at Pherae had passedinto the hands of Jason, a man of great energy andability, and probably the son of Lycophron, thoughthis is not expressly stated. He inherited the ambi­tions \iews of Lycophron, and meditated nothingl"ss than extending his dominion over the whole ofGreece, for which bis central situation seemed tooflffr many facilities. He cherished even still moreextensive projects of aggrandisement, and, once mas­ter of Greece, he looked forward to conquer the Per­sian empire, which the retreat of the Ten ThousandGreeks and the campaigns of Agesilaus in Asiaseemed to point out as an easy enterprise. But thefirst step wjis bis election as Tagus of Thessaly, andthe submission of all the Thcssalian cities to hisauthority. For this purpose it was necessary to ob­tain the acquiescence of Pharsalus, and although hemight have gained his object by force, he preferredto effect it by negotiation, and accordingly franklydisclosed his schemes to Polydannas, and ottered himthe second place in Thessaly, if he would support hisviews. Polydamaa asked theadvice of the Spartans,and finding that he could receive from them no help,he acceded to the projxtsals of Jason, and inducedthe Pharsalians to espouse his cause. .Sxin afterthis, probably in 11. 0. 374, Jason was elected Tagnsof Thessaly, and proceeded to settle the contingentof cavalry and heavy-armed troops which the Pbar-salian cities were to furnish. He now possessed aforce of 8000 cavalry and more than 20.000 in­fantry; and Alceta.s I., king of Kpeirus, and Amyn-tas II., king of Macedonia were his allies. (Xen.11.11 vi. I. 2 — 10; Diod. xv. 60.) He could ineffect command a greater force than any other statein Greece; and from the disunion and exhaustion ofthe other Grecian states, it seemed not improbablethat he might be able to carry his ambitions projectsinto effect. He had already formed an alliance withThebes, and after the battle of Leuctra (B.C. 371)he was invited by the Thebans to join them inattacking the Lacedaemonian camp. Hut Jason'spolicy was to prevent any other power from obtainingthe preponderance in Greece, ami accordingly uponhis arrival at Leuctra lie advised the Thebans notto drive the Lacedaemonians to despair, and obtaineda truce for the latter, which enabled them to securetheir safety by a retreat (Xen Hell, vi. 4. § 20, 1 seq.)

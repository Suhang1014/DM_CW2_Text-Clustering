His second marriage with Malasontha,the grand-daughter of Theodoric, endeared Ger-manus to the Goths themselves y and they marchedwith reluctance against the father of a royal infant,the last offspring of the line of Amali. A splendidallowance was assigned by the emperor: the generalcontributed his private fortune; his two sons werepopular and active; and he surpassed, in the prompti足tude and success of his levies, the expectation ofmankind. He was permitted to select some squa足drons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans, as well asthe youth of Constantinople and Europe, engagedtheir voluntary service; and as far as the heart ofGermany, his fame and liberality attracted the aid ofthe Barbarians. The Romans advanced to Sardica;an army of Sclavonians fled before their march; butwithin two days of their final departure, the designsof Germanus were terminated by his malady anddeath.

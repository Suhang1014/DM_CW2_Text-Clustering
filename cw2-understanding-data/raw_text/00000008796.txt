It is noticed also by Ptolemyil in the Itineraries, bnt without any indicationit il was a place of any importance. (Ptol. iii. 3.5; /fiV Ant. p. 83.) But the nncient remainsII existing prove that it must have been a consi-nible town under the Roman Umpire: and we learnan the inscriptions on ancient milestones that theincipal road through the island ran directly fromiraha to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter« a place much frequented. It was also an cpis-nal see during the early part of the middle ages.In existing port at Porto Torres, which ia almostholly artificial, is based in great part on Romannidations; and there exist also the remains of anH*V (which, as we learn from an inscription, wasPirated to Fortnne, and restored in the reign ofnilij.), of thermae, of a basilica and an aqueduct,t well as a bridee over the adjoining small river,:!'. called the Fiume Turrilano. The ancient cityintinnrd to be inhabited till the 11th century, when« f rratcr part of the population migrated to Sw­an, about 10 miles inland, and situated on a hill.Ins is still the second city of the island.

(Plin. iii. 5. s. 8; 7ofl. Pent.) The nameis found in an inscription, which confirms its mu­nicipal rank. (Murat. Inner, p. 328.) Bnt it up-pears to have been in Roman times an obscure town,and we find no allusion to it as of ancient Etrus­can origin. Yet that it was so is rendered probableby the tombs that liave been discovered on the site,and some of which contain sarcophagi and otherrelics of considerable interest; though none oftlie.seappear to be of very early date. The tombs havebeen carefully examined, and the antiquities pre­served by a resident antiquary, Sig. Campanari, acircumstance which has given some celebrity to thename of Totcanelta, and led to a very exasperatedestimate of the importance of Tuscania, which was .apparently in ancient times never a place of anyconsideration. It was probably during the periodof Etruscan independence a dependency of Tar­quinii. The only remains of ancient buildings arosome fragments of reticulated masonry, undoubtedlyof the Roman period.

Ttisculus, Tib. i. 7. 57; Stat. Si7r. iv.4. 16; Tusculanensis, Cic.

When Dionysius ofHalicarnassus (x. 20) places it at a distance of 101)stadia, or 12 \ miles, from Rome, he does not speakwith his accustomed accuracy, since it was 120stadia, or 15 miles, from that city by the ViaLatina. Josephus {Ant. xviii. 7. S 6) places theimperial villa of Tiberius at Tuscnlum at 100 stadiafrom Home, which, however, lay at some distance tothe W. of the town. Festus (a. r. 7u*coi) makes Tus-culnm a diminutive of Tuscus, but there is but slightauthority to connect the town with the Etruscans.According to common tradition, it was founded byTelegonus, the son of Ulysses and Circe; and hencowe find ita name paraphrased in the Latin poets as"Telegoni moenia " (Ov. Fast. iii. 91, iv. 71; Prop,iii. 30. 4; SiL It. xii. 535) and '■ Circaea moenia"(Hor. A/wo", i. 30); and the hill on which it stoodcalled " Telegoni juga parriridae " (Id. Oof iii. 29.8), "Circaeum dorsum" (Sil. It. vit. 691), and"Telegoni jugera" (Stat Silv. 1.3. 83). ThusTusculum did not claim so remote an nri;in asmany other Latin cities; and. as being founded ageneration after the Trojan War, Virgil, a learnedantiquary, consistently omits all notice of it in hisAeneid. The author of the treatise entitled OrigoGentis Romanae mentions that it was made a de­pendency or colony of Alba by Latinos Silvias (c. 17.§ 6). After the destruction of Alba by TnlluaHostilius it appears to have recovered its independ­ence, and to have become a republic under the go­vernment of a dictator.

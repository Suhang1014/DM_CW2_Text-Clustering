The sea-onion, usciltamaritima,n and madder, "rubia," whichcover the plains, remind the traveller of what Hero-dotus (iv. 189,190) says about the practice of theLibynu women dying their goat-skins with red, and ofthe portable houses constructed of stalks of asphodel,intertwined with rushes. Now, as then, the u jerboa"(Mkous, Herod, iv. 192) is common. The few coinsof Marmaric towns, such as those of Apis andBatrachus, are of the same workmanship as theAegyptian mints. (Eckhel, vol. iv. p. 116.) Ptolemy (iv. 5. § 22) enumerates the followingtribes in Marmarica:—In the Lybian nome, along thecoast, the Zygkitae (Zuyonai), Ciiattam (Xar-Taroi), and Zygenses (Zi/yeir); further to the S.,in the interior, the lit ji.sms (BooftiV) and Oo-daf.mi. In the di.-trict of Ammonium (§ 23), theAnagombri ('Avdyopgpoi), Iobacciii ('IoSojc-Xoi), and Rt uhtak ('PovaSirai). In the Mar­maric nome, to the N., on the coast, the I.ikyakciiak (AiSu<lf>xa')> the Axekitar (Arnpirai),and Bassachitae (Boo-axcr""); to the S. of these,the Ai i.n w.

The same place, orrather the fortress, is called by Strabo (vii. p. 290)Buiaeinon, and is identified with the modem Budarii,in Bohemia. [L. S.] MAKOXEIA (Mapwvua: Eth. Mapuvlrn!), arich and powerful city of the Cicones, in Thrace,situated on the Aegean sea, not far from the lakeImnaris. (Herod, vii. 109.) It was said to havebeen founded by Maron, a son of I)ionysus (Eurip.Cycl. v. 100, 141), or, according to some, a com­panion of Osiris (Diod. Sic. i. 20); but Scymnus(675) relates that it waa built by a colony fromChios in the fourth year of the fifty-ninth Olympiad(b. c. 540). Pliny (iv. 11. -. 18) tells us thatthe ancient name was Ortagurea. The people of'■I 1 ... 1 venerated Dionysus in an especial manner,as we learn from their coins, probably on account ofthe sujierior character of their wine, which was cele­brated as early as the days of Homer (Od. i. 40).This wine was universally esteemed all over thenm-ient world; it was said to possess the odour ofNectar (Xonnus, i. 12, xvii. 6, xix. 11), and to bocapable of mixture with twenty times its quantityof water (Horn. Od. ix. 197); and, according toPliny, on an experiment being made by Mucianns,who doubted the tnith of Homer's statement, it wasfnunil to bear even a larger propr*tion of water,(Plin. xiv. 4. s. 6; comp. "Victa Maroneo foedatusluniina Baccho," Tibull. ir. 1. 57). Maroneia was taken by Philip V. of March,n inB. c. 200 ; and wlien he was ordered by the Romansto evacuate the towns of Thrace, he vented his rageby slaughtering a great number of the inhabitants of the city. (I.iv. xxxi. 16, xxxix. 24; Polyb. rxH.6, 13, xxiii. 11, 13.) The Romans subseqnemlygranted Maroneia to Attalus; but they almost imme­diately afterwards revoked their gift, and declared ita free city. (Polyb. xxx. 3.) By Con-tanunePorphyrogenitus (Them. ii. 2), Maroneia is reckonedamong the towns of Macedon. Tlie modern nana*is Marogna. and it has been the seat of an arrh-bishopric. (Comp.

(Strab. v. p. 241.) Theywere bounded on the N. by the Vestini, from wbnrathey were separated by the Atemus, ami on the 8.by the Frentani, while to the W. and SW. they ap­parently extended inland as far as the lufty moon-tain barriers of the Majella and the Morrow*, whichsejiarated them from the Peligni, and effectually cotthem off from all intercourse with their neirhbourion that side, except by the valley of tlie A'ernoa.The southern limit of their territory is not staled byany ancient author, but was probably formed by theriver Foro, which falls into tlie Adriatic about7 miles from the mouth of the Ateraua (/Vjmro).Pliny, indeed, extends the district of the Frentasias far as the Aternus (Plin. iii. 12. s. 17). thencutting off the Marrucini altogether from the n;but there seems little doubt that this is erroneutss,[Frentaki.] The Marrucini were, undoubtedly,like the other tribes in their immediate neighbourhood,of Sabine origin, and appear to have been closely coes-nected with the Marsi, indeed, the two names are littlemore than different forms of the same, a fact whichappears to have been already recognised by Cato(oy>. 1'rucian. ix. p. 871).

OCR Output SEGESVA. SEGOBRIGII. Two other streams .ire mentioned by Aeliah (V. II.ii. 33) in connection with Selesta, the Telme^sus amithe Porpax; but we are wholly at a loss to determinethem. Some vestipes of the ancient walls may still betraced; but almost the only ruins which remainwithin the circuit of the ancient city are those ofthe theatre. These have been lately cleared out,and exhibit the praecinctio and sixteen rows of seats,great part in good preservation. The general formand arrangement are purely Greek; and the buildingrests at the back on the steep rocky slope of the bill,out of which a considerable part of it has been ex­cavated. It is turned towards the X. and commandsa fine view of the broad bay of Caitell 'a More.(For a more detailed account of the antiquities ofSegesta, see Swinburne's Travels, vol. ii. pp. 31 —235; Smyth's Sicily, pp. 67, C>8; ami especiallySerra di Falco, Antichita del/a Sicilia, vol. i. pt. ii.)Ancient writers mention 1 lie existence in the teiritoryof Segesta of thermal springs or waters, which seemto have enjoyed considerable reputation (to. .depict(JSara AfyeaTaia, Strab. vi. p. 275; Stpfia KovTpara 'Eye'iraia, Diod. iv. 23). These are apparentlythe sulphureous springs at a spot called Calavietti,about a mile to the N. of the site of the ancient city.(Kazell. Sic. vii. 4.) They are mentioned in theItinerary as "Aquae Segestanae sivc P'mcianac"(Itin. Ant. p. HI); but the origin of the latter nameis wholly unknown. The coins of Segesta have the figure of a dog onthe reverse, which evidently alludes to the fable oftlio river-god Crimisus, the mythical parent ofAeirestus, having assumed that form. (Serv. ad Aen.i. 550, v. 30; Eckhel, vol. i. 234.) The older coins(as already observed) uniformly write the name2EPE2TA, as on the one annexed: those of laterdate, which are of copper onlv, bear the leirendErE2TAinN (Eckhel, /. c. p. 236). [E. II. B] COIN OF SEGESTA. SEGESTA (Sestrt), a town on the coast of Li-guria, mentioned by Pliny, in describing the coast ofthat country from Genua to the Macru. (Plin. iii.5. s. 7.) He calls it Segesta Tigulliorum; so that itseems to have belonged to a tribe of the name of theTigullii, and a town named Tigullia is mentioned byhim just before. Selesta is commonly identified withSestri (called Sestri di Levante to distinguish itfrom another place of the name), a considerabletown about 30 miles from Genoat while Tigullia isprobably represented by Tregoso, a village about 2mile.-, further inland, where there are considerableRoman remains. Some of the MSS. of Pliny, in­deed, have " Tigulliaintus, et Selesta Tigulliorum,"■uhieh would seem to jwint clearly to this position ofthe two places. (Sillig, ad loc.) It is probable,also, that the Tegulata of the Itineraries (/tin.AM. p. 293) is identical with the Tigullia ofPliny. [E. H.B.] SEGESTA, or SEGESTICA. [Siscia.]SEGIDA (267J5a, Strabo, iii. p. 162). 1.

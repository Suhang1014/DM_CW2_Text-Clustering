ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. this opposition of Joseph's, when she did notexpect it, made her still more violent in herlove to him, and she resolved to accomplishher design by a second attempt. When, therefore, there was a festivalcoming on, in which it was the custom forwomen to come to the public solemnity, shepretended to her husband that she was sick,as contriving an opportunity for solitude andleisure, that she might entreat Joseph again.This opportunity being obtained, she usedmore kind words to him than before, and saidthat it had been good for him to have yieldedto her first solicitation, and to have given herno repulse, both because of the reverence heought to bear to her dignity, who solicitedhim, and because of the vehemency of herpassion, by which she was forced, though shewere his mistress, to condescend beneath herdignity. But that he might now, by takingmore prudent advice, wipe off the imputationof his former folly; for whether it were thathe expected the repetition of her solicitations,she had now made it, and that with greaterearnestness than before, for that she had pre­tended sickness on this very account, and hadpreferred his conversation before the festivaland its solemnity: or whether he opposed herformer discourses, as not believing she couldbe in earnest: she now gave him sufficientsecurity, by thus repeating her application,that she meant not in the least by fraud toimpose on him, and assured him, that if hecomplied with her affections, he might expectthe enjoyment of the advantages he alreadyhad: and if he were submissive to her, heshould have still greater advantages: but thathe must look for revenge and hatred fromher in case he rejected her desires, and pre­ferred the reputation of chastity before hismistress; for that he would gain nothing bysuch procedure, as she would then becomehis accuser, and would falsely pretend to herhusband that he attempted her chastity, andthat Potiphar would hearken to her wordsrather than to his, let his be ever so agree­able to the truth. But though the woman said thus, and evenwith tears in her eyes, Joseph was not dis­suaded from his chastity, nor induced by fearto a compliance with her: but he opposedalike her solicitations and her threatenings,and was afraid to do an ill thing, choosing rather to undergo the sharpest punishment,than to enjoy his present advantages by doingwhat his own conscience knew would justlydeserve that he should die for it. He alsoreminded her that she was a married woman,and that she ought to cohabit with her hus­band only, and desired her to suffer theseconsiderations to have more weight with herthan the short pleasure of lustful dalliancewhich would occasion trouble and repentanceafterwards, and yet would not amend whathad been done amiss. He also suggested thefear she would be in lest they should becaught, and that the advantage of conceal­ment was uncertain, and that only while thewickedness was not known would there beany quiet for them. But that she might havethe enjoyment of her husband's companywithout any danger, and he told her, that inthe company of her husband she might havegreat boldness, from a good conscience, bothbefore God and before men; nay, that shewould act more consistently as his mistress,and make use of her authority over him bet­ter while she persisted in her chastity, thanwhen they were both ashamed for what wick­edness they had been guilty of; and that itis much better to depend on a good life knownto have been so, than upon the hopes of theconcealment of evil practices. Joseph, by saying this and more, tried torestrain the violent passion of the woman, andto reduce her affections within the rules ofreason; but she grew more ungovernable, andearnest in the matter: and since she despairedof persuading him, she laid her hands uponhim, and had recourse to violence. But assoon as Joseph had got away from her anger,leaving his garment with her, and leaped outof her chamber, she was equally afraid lesthe should discover her lewdness to her hus­band, and incensed at the affront he hadoffered her, so she resolved to be before-handwith him, and to accuse him falsely to Poti­phar, and by that means to revenge herselffor his pride and contempt; thinking it a wisething in itself, and also becoming a woman,thus to prevent his accusation. Accordinglyshe sat sorrowfully, and in confusion, framingherself so hypocritically and angrily, that thesorrow, which was really occasioned by herdisappointment, might appear to be for anattempt upon her chastity: so that when her

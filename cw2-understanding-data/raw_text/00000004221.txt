V. to the city, but declined from him on both sides, and pressedafter those that fled up the hill; yet did he still fall upontheir flank, and put a stop to their fury. In the mean time,a disorder and a terror fell again upon those that were fortiÂ­fying their camp at the top of the hill, upon their seeingthose beneath them running away; insomuch that the wholelegion was dispersed, while they thought that the sallies ofthe Jews upon them were plainly insupportable, and thatTitus was himself put to flight; because they took it forgranted, that if he had stayed the rest would never have fledfor it. Thus were they encompassed on every side by a kindof panic fear, and some dispersed themselves one way andsome another, till certain of them saw their general in thevery midst of an action, and, being under great concern forhim, they loudly proclaimed the danger he was in to theentire legion : and now shame made them turn back, and theyreproached one another that they did worse than run awayby deserting Caesar. So they used their utmost force againstthe Jews, and declining from the straight declivity, they drovethem on heaps into the bottom of the valley. Then did theJews turn about and fight them ; but as they were themselvesretiring, and now, because the Romans had the advantage ofthe ground and were above the Jews, they drove them all intothe valley. Titus also pressed upon those that were nearhim. and sent the legion again to fortify their camp; whilehe, and those that were with him before, opposed the enemy,and kept them from doing farther mischief; insomuch that ifI may be allowed neither to add any thing out of flattery,nor to diminish any thing out of envy, but to speak the plaintruth, Caesar did twice deliver that entire legion when it wasin jeopardy, and gave them a quiet opportunity of fortifyingtheir camp.

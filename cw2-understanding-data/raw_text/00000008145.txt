OCR Output VIA AEMILIA. VIA AEMILIA. 1287 place soon after the complete subjugation of theTranspadane Gauls. Nor do we know with anycertainty whether the name of Via Aemilia was everapplied in common usage to this portion of the road,or to the branches that led from Mediolanum to thefont of the Alps, as well as from that city by Veronato l'atavium. Bat as Strabo distinctly applies thename to the branch that led by l'atavium to Aqui­leia.. we may here most conveniently include all theprincipal highroads of the N. of Italy under oneview in the present article. 1. The main or trunk line of the Via Aemiliafrom Ariminam to Placentia. The stations on thisr'-a*i are thus given in the Antnnine Itinerary, wherettwr are repeated more than once (pp.99, 126, 287);anal, from the direct line of the road, the distances aresubject to no doubt :— From Ariminam (Rimini) to Caesena (tesewi) ... xx. M. P.Fa vent ia (Faema) - xxiv.Forum Cornelii (Imola) - - x.Dononia (Bologna) - - - xxiv.Matina (Mixicna) ... xxv.Kegium (Reggio) .... xvii.Parma (Parma) - - - - xviii.Fidenliula (BorgoS. Donino) xv.Placentia (J'iactnza) - xxiv.The same line is given more in detail in the Jeru­salem .Itinerary (p. 615, flee), with which theTaatola substantially agrees; but the distances arcmure correctly given in the latter.The stations enumerated are:—Competu (/. II.) Ad Com- fluentes (Tab.) - - - xii. JtP.Oaesena (Ctxcna) - - - - viii.Forum Populii (Forlimpopoli) vii.Forum Livii (Forli) - - - vii.Fa vent ia (Faenza) - - - X.Forum Cornelii (Imola) - - x.Clatema (Quoderna) - - xir.Bononia (Bologna) X.Forum Gallorum .... xvii.Hutina (Modena) ... viii.Kegium (Reggio) ... xvii.Tannetnm (Tone to) • - - xi.Parma (Parma) .... vii.Fidentia ( Borgo S. Donino) xv.Florentia (Firemuola) x.Placentia (Piacenza) - - - XT.The general agreement in the distances above given(which are those of the Tabula) with those of theAntonine Itinerary, though the division is different,ntly shows the accuracy of the two. The dis-in the Jerusalem Itinerary are, for this line ofroute, generally less accurate. Some obscure Muta-mentioned in the one document, and not in the, have been omitted in the above list. 2. Continuation of the Via Aemilia from PlacentiaMediolanum. This line is summarily given in the ine Itinerary thus:—From Placentia to Laus I'ompeia (Lodi Vecchio) - xxiv. M. P.Tbence to Mediolanum ( Milan) xvi.The same distances are thus divided in the Jeru-Itirjerary:—Ad Kolas - • • • - - xi. M. p.TresTabemae .... v. Laus ...... viii Ad Nonnm ..... vii. Mediolanum ----- vii. (ix. ?) are unknown, and arc expressly called mere Mutationes, or places for changing horses. 3. From Mediolanum to Augusta Praetoria, atthe foot of the Alps, the distances, as given in theAntonine Itinerary, are :— From Mediolanum to Novaria (iVnrara) - - Vercellae (Vercelli) - - Eporedia (Icrea) - - Vitricium (Verrez) - - Augusta Praetoria (Aosta)The same authority gives a circuitous line of routefrom Mediolanum to Vercellae (where it rrjoins thepreceding) by Ticinum (Pavia) ... xxii. M. p. Ijiuincllum (Lometto) - - xxii. Vercellae (Verctlli) ... xxvi. 4. From Mediolanum to Aquileia. The igiven in the Itineraries are as follows:— Med. to Argcntia - - - - x. u. p.Pons Aureoli (Pontirolo) x.Bergamum (Bergamo) - xiii. xxxiii. m. p. xvi. xxxiii. xxi. xxv. Brixia (Brescia)Sirmio (Sermione)Verona ( Verona)Vicentia ( Vicenza) -l'atavium (Padova)Allinuin (Altmo) -Concordia ( Concordia)Aquileia (Aquileia) - xxxviii.(xxxii.)• xxii. - xxii. - xxxiii. - xxvii. (xxii.) - xxxiii. - xxxi. - xxxi. (In the above line of route the minor stations(Mutationes) given in the Jerusalem Itinerary areomitted. For an examination of them, and a carefulof all the Roman roads through Cisalpinesee Walckenaer, Geographic da Gaulcs,vol. iii. pp. 2—13.) 5. From Bononia to Aquileia. This is the roadof which Strabo expressly speaks as a continuation ofthe Via Aemilia (v. p. 217), but it is probable thathe did not mean to say that it branched off directlyfrom Bononia; at least the only line given in theItineraries turns off from the main line of the ViaAemilia at Mntina, and thence proceeds to Vicus Serninus (?) ... xxiii. M. P. Vicus Varianus (Bariano, onthe N. bank of the Po) . xx. Anneianum (Legnagot) - - xvii. Ateste (Kite) ..... xx. Patavium (Padoea) ... xxv.whence it followed the same line to Aquileia asthat given above. Another line of road, which thoughmore circuitous was probably more frequented, ledfrom Mulina by Colicaria (an uncertain station) tolinstilia (Ottiglia). where it crossed the Padus, andthence direct to Verona (xxx. M. P.). (Itin. Ant.p. 282.) 6. From Placentia to Dertona, where it commu­nicated with the road constructed by Aemilins Scau-rus across the Apennines to Vada Sabata. (Strab.v. p. 217.) The stations on this short line were:— From Placentia to Comillomagus- .... xxv. at. r.lria (Voghcra) .... xviDertona (Tortnna) x.The first station, Comillomagus, or Camiliomagus,as the name is written in the Tabula, is unknown,bnt must have been situated a short distance to theW. of Broni. 7. Lastly, a branch of the Via Aemilia led fromPlacentia to Ticinum (Paeia), whence it was car­ried westwards to Augusta Taurinorum ( Turin) and 4*4

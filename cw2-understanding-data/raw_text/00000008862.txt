The Table hasa road from Divodurum {Metz) to Augusta Tre-virorum (7Vi'er). From Divodurum to Caranuscais xlli., from Caranusca to Ricciacum x., and fromRicciacum to Augusta x. D'Anville guessed Ric­ciacum to be Remich on the Motel; but it is onlya guess. There is evidently an error in the Tablein the distance between Divodurum and Ricciacum,which is a great deal too much. The geographershave handled this matter in various ways. [Ca­ranusca.] (See also Ukert, Gallien, p. 512, andthe note.) [G. L.] RICINA. 1. {Eth. Ricinensis: Ru. near Ma-cerala), a municipal town of Picenum, situated ona hill above the right bank of the river Potentia{Potema), about 15 miles from the sea. Pliny isthe only geographer that mentions it (iii. 13. s. 18);but the "ager Ricinensis" is noticed also in theLiber Coloniarum (p. 226), and we learn from aninscription that it received a colony under the em­peror Severus, and assumed in consequence the titleof " Colonia Helvia Ricina" (Orell. Inter. 915;Cluver. Ital. p. 739.) Its ruins arc still risible,and include the remains of a theatre and otherbuildings. They are situated about 8 miles fromMacerata, and 6 from Recanati, which has preservedthe traces of the ancient name, though it does notoccupy the ancient site. (Holsten. Not. ad Cluver.p. 137.) The Tabula correctly places it at a distanceof 12 miles from Septempeda {S. Severino.) {Tab.Peut.) 2. A small town on the coast of Lignria, men­tioned only in the Tabula, which places it on thecoast to the E. of Genoa. It is commonly identifiedwith Recco, a town about 12 miles from Genoa, butthe Tabula gives the distance as only 7, so that theidentification is very doubtful. {Tab. Pent.; Geogr.Rav. iv. 32.) [E. H. B.] RICINA {'PiKira, Ptol. ii. 2. § 11), one of thoEbudae insulac or Hebrides. [T. H. D.] RIDUNA, one of the islands off that part of theGallic coast which was occupied by the Armoricstates. As the Marit. Itin. mentions Caesares{Jertey), Sarnia {Guernsey), and Riduna, it is con­cluded that Riduna is Aurigny or Alderney offCap de la Hague. [G. L.] RIGODULUM, a place on the Mosella {Motel),"protected either by mountains or the river."(Tacitns, Hitt. iv. 71.) In the war with Civilisthis place was occupied by Valcntinus with a largeforce of Treviri. Civilis, who was at Mainz,marched to Rigodulum in three days (tertiis castris)and stormed the place. On the following day bereached Colonia Trevirorum ( Trier). It is supposedthat Rigodulum may be Reol on the Motel. Lip-sius assumes Rigodulum to be Rigol near Con-fluentes {Coblem), but that is impossible. Am-mianus Marceilinus (xvi. 6) places Rigodulum nearConfluentes, but his authority is small; and theremay be some corruption in the text. [G.

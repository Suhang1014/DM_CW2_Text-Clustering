[Book IV. murder of his comrade in arms; they charged Orestes withthe murder of his mother, or undertook to defend him; orperhaps they helped Hannibal with a supplementary goodadvice as to the question whether he would do better tocomply with the invitation to Rome, or to remain in Carthage,or to take flight. It was natural that the Catonian opposi­tion should once more bestir itself against these offensive^2. and pernicious conflicts of words. The censors of 662issued a warning to teachers and parents not to allow theyoung men to spend the whole day in exercises, whereoftheir ancestors had known nothing; and the man, fromwhom this warning came, was no less than the first forensicorator of his age, Lucius Licinius Crassus. Of course .theCassandra spoke in vain; declamatory exercises in Latin onthe current themes of the Greek schools became a permanentingredient in the education of Roman youth, and contributedtheir part to educate the very boys as forensic and politicalplayers and to stifle in the bud all earnest and trueeloquence. As the aggregate result of this modern Roman educationthere sprung up the new idea of "humanity," as it wascalled, which consisted partly of a more or less superficialappropriation of the aesthetic culture of the Hellenes, partlyof a privileged Latin culture as an imitation or mutilatedcopy of the Greek. This new humanity, as the very nameindicates, renounced the specific peculiarities of Roman life,nay even came forward in opposition to them, and com­bined in itself, just like our closely kindred "generalculture," a nationally cosmopolitan and socially exclusivecharacter. Here too we trace" the revolution, which sepa­rated classes and levelled nations.

He had his■ earn, his military chest, with thea a Ailswed bin) frotn borne for the war, his own and his army's baggage, and a great number ofhorses which had been bought for him in Spain andItaly. After his failure before Gergovia, the Aeriuiat Noviodunum massacred those who were there tolook after stores, the negotiatores. and the travellerswho were in the place. They divided the moneyamong them and the horses, carried off in boats allthe corn that they could, and burnt the rest orthrew it into the river. Thinking they could nothold the town, they burnt it. It was a regularGallic outbreak, performed in its true national style.Tiiis was a great loss to Caesar - and it may seemthat he was imprudent in leaving such great storesin the power of treacherous allies. But he was instraits during this year, and probably he could notdo otherwise than he did. Dion Cassius (xl. 38) tells the story out ofCaesar of the affair of Noviodunum. He states in­correctly what Caesar did on the occasion, and lieshows that he neither understood his original, norknew what he was writing about. 3. A town of the Suessiones, mentioned by Caesar(B. G. ii. 12). Caesar (b. c. 57), after leaving theAxona (Aisne), entered the territory of the Sues­siones, and making one day's long march, reachedNoviodunum, which was surrounded by a high walland a broad ditch. The place surrendered to Caesar.It has been conjectured that Noviodunum Suessio-num was the place afterwards called Augusta[Augusta Suessionum], but it is by no meanscertain. [G. L.] NOVIODUNUM (Uoovtotowov). 1. A plat e inPannonia Superior, on the great road leading fromAemona to Siscia, on the southern bank of the Savus.(PtoL ii. 15. § 4; Itin. Ant. p. 259; Geogr. Kav.iv. 19, where it is called Novindum.) Ita modernname is Novigrad. 2. A town and fortress in Lower Moesia, a littleabove the point where tbe Danube divides itself intoseveral arms. (PtoL iii. 10. § 11.) Near this townthe emperor Valeria constructed a bridge over theDanube for his expedition against the Greuthungi.(Amm. Marc, xxvii. 1.) Some writers have supposed,without any g<>od reason, that Noviodunum is thepoint at which Darius ordered a bridge to be builtwhen he set out on his expedition against theScythians. The town, as its name indicates, was ofCeltic origin. According to the Antonine Itinerary(p. 226) Noviodunum was the station of the legio n.Herculea, while according to the M Notitia Imperii"it had the legio I. Jovia for its garrison. Duringthe later period of the Western Empire, the fortifica­tions of the place had been destroyed, but they wererestored by Justinian (Procop. de Aed. iv. 11; com p.Hierocl. p. 637; and Constant. Porph. de Them. ii. 1,where the place is called Ua6t6Howos and Na&o-Zowov). The Civitas Nova in Jomandes {Get. 5)is probably the same as Noviodunum; and it isgenerally believed that its site is occupied by themodern Isaczi [L. S.] NOVIOMAGUS (Noio>o>oy). 1. A town inGallia, which afterwards had the name Lexovii [Lex-ovii], which was that of a people of Celtica. Inthe Greek text of Ptolemy (ii. 8. § 2), as it is atpresent printed, the word Li men {Kifiijv) is putafter the name Noeomagns. But this is not true,for Noriomagus is Lisieux, which is not on thesea, though the territory of the Lexovii extended tothe sea. 2. Afterwards Nemetes, in Gallia, the capital ofthe Nemetae or Nemetes [Nemetes.] The name O G

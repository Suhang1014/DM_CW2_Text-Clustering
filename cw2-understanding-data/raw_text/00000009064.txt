TheIndian Ocean contains at its eastern end three prin­cipal gulfs, which are noticed in ancient authors,—the Sinus pRKiaaucts (Ptol. vii. 2. § 5), in tlicChersonesus Aurea (probably now the Straits ofMalacca); the Sisi'sSabauacl's (Ptol. vii. 2. §4),now the Gulf of Mai'taban; and the Stars Gan-gkticts, or Bay of Bengal. [V.] INDIGETES, or INDI'GETAK, (T^i/op-cn,Strab.; 'EKSrytrai, Ptol.), a people of HispauiaTarraeonensis, in the extreme NE. corner of thepeninsula, around the gulf of Uhodn and Kinporme(Gulf of Ain/mrias), as far as the Trophies ofPompey (ra nojumjtou rpAwata, ayaOrjuara townuMW»,ioi/), on the .summit of the pass wer thePyrenees, which formed tho boundary of Gauland Spain (Strab. iii. p. 160, iv. p. 17H). [Pom-pkii Tropaka.] They were divided into fourtribes. Their chief cities, besides Kmi'oiuae andIEiioua, were: Jitkcakia (Toiryyapta, Ptol. ii. 6.§ 73 * JtmaverOy or, as some suppose, Figueras),16 M P. south of the summit of the Pyrenees (Sum-mum Pyrenaeum, Itin.)t on the high road to Tarrsco(/tin. Ant. pp.390, 397); Cinsiama (Cervia), 15M. P. further S. (/ft.; Tab. Pent.); and Decia.na,near Junquera (PtoL ii. 6. § 73). On the promontoryfarmed by the E. extremity of the Pyrenees (C.Creus),was a temple of Venus, with a small sea[K>rt on the N.side ('AtppoSiffiat, Steph.

Ptolemy names two smallrivers as falling into the gulf of Emporiae, theCi-oniAXi's (KAutfaavis: Fluvia) and the Sam-bkocah (2a+i€p6na lic$o\ai): Pliny names theTichik, which is the small river flowing past Rosas.The district round the gulf of Emporiae was calledJlucarius Cami'I'.s (to 'lovyydpioy ircou/*), fromthe abundance of rushes which grew upon iu marshysoil.

IvSo-atcv&rjs), a district of wide extent alone the Indus,which probably comprehended the whole tractwatered by the Lower Indus, Cutch, Guzerat, andSaurashtran. It derived its name from the Scythiantribes, who gradually preyed onwards to the southand the sea-coast after they had overthrown theGraeco-Bactrian empire, about A. I>. 136. It isfirst mentioned in the Peri pi us M. E. (p. 22) as occu­pying the banks of the Indus; while in Ptolemy is afuller description, with the names of some of itsprincipal subdivisions, as Pattalene, Abiria, andSvrattrene (Saurashtran), with an extensive list oftown* which belonged to it (vii. 1. §§ 55—61).Sxne of them, as Binagara (properly Minnagara),have been recognised as partially Scythic in form,(lessen. Pentap. p. 56; cf. Isidnr. Char. p. 9.) InDionvMUH Periegetes (r. 1088) the same people aretli-M-ribed as potum Sxvfat, As late as the middle oftli«- sixth centory A.n.. Cosmas Indicoplcustes speaksof White Huns, or Mongolians, as the inhabitants ofthe I'anjab (ii. p. 338). These may be consideredas the remains of the same Scythic empire, the pre-derrvtre of the hordes who subsequently pouredilmn from the north under Jinghfi Khan. (Hitter,Krdhmde, vol. i. p. 558.) [V.] INDUS (o TrWf), one of the principal riven of Asia, and the boundary westward of India. !t ismentioned first in ancient authors by Ilccataeus ofMiletus (Fragtn. 144, ed. Klauscn). and *u^**-oucntly by Herodotus (iv. 44), who, however, onlynotices it in connection with various tribes who, hestates, lived tijion its banks. As in tlte ca>e ofIndia itself, ho in that of the Indus, the first realdescription which the ancients obtained of this riverwas from the historians of Alexander the Great'smarches. Arrian states that its sources were in tb#lower spurs of the Paropamisus, or Indian CaDcasu*(Hindu-K ash); wherein he agrees with Mela (iii. 7.§ 6), Stralw (xv. p. 690). Curtius (viii. 9. § 3), andotlier writers. It was, in Arrian s opinion, a vaststream, even from its first sources, the largest riverin the world except the Ganges, and the recipientof many tributaries, themselves larger than any <>t In rknown stream. It has been conjectured, from thedescriptions of the Indus which A man has preserved,that the writers from whom he has condensed hisnarrative must have seen it at the time when itswaters were at their highest, in August and Sep­tember. Quoting fromCtesias (v. 4,11), and with theauthority of the other writers (v. 20), Arrian gives40 stadia for the mean breadth of the river, and 15stadia where it was most contracted; below the con­fluence of the principal tiibutaries he considers itsbreadth may be 100 stadia, and even more than thiswhen much flooded (vi. 14). Pliny, on the otlierhand, considers that it is nowhere more than SOstadia broad (vi. 20. s. 23), which is clearly thesame opinion as that of Strabo, who states, thatthough thoMj wfco hud not measured the breadth patit down at 100 stadia, those, on the other hand, wbahad measured it, asserted that 50 stadia was itsgreatest, and 7 stadia its least breadth (xv. p. 70O).Its depth, according to Pliny (J. c.)» was nowhereless than 15 fathoms. According to Diodorns, it wasthe greatest river in the world after the Nile (ii. 35^Curtius states that its waters were cold, and of tl*colour of the sea (viii. 9. § 4). Its current is held bysome to have been slow (as by Mela, iii. 7- § 6); byothers, rapid (as by Eustath. in Dionus. Perieg. r.1088). Its course towards the sea, after leaving tii«mountains, was nearly S\V. (Plin. vi. 20. s. 23); osits way it received, according to Strabo (xv. p. 70O)and Arrian (v. 6), 15, according to Pliny, 19other tributary riven (I.e.). About 2000 stadiafrom the Indian Ocean, it was divided into twoprincipal arms (Strab. xv. p. 701), forming therebya Delta, like that of the Nile, though not so Urge,called Pattalene, from its chief town Pattala (whkaArrian asserts meant, in the Indian tongue. Delta(v. 4); though this statement may be questioned \(Cf. also Arrian, 2nd. 2; Dionys. Perieg. v. lObS.)The flat land at the mouths of rivers which howfrom high mountain-ranges with a rapid stream, bever clianging: hence, probably, the different ac­counts which we receive of the mouths of the Indusfrom those who recorded the history of Alcxandet,and from the works of later geographers. Theformer (as we have stated), with Sirs bo, gave th*Indus only two principal outlets iuto the IiulunOcean, — at a distance, the one from the other, ac­cording to Aristobalus (ap. Strab. xv. p. 690), of1000 stadia, but, according to Nearchus (L c). of1800 stadia. The latter mention more than twomouths: Mela (iii. 7. § 6) speaking of "pJuraout is," and Ptolemy giving the names of seven (riL1. § 28), in which he is confirmed by the author ofthe PerijHUt ilaiu Erythraei (p. 22).

OCR Output MENESTHEI. 3G9 MENUTHIAS. Mta, situated to SE. of the highroad betweenAlrxandn-ia and Hermopolis, near the Canonic armof the Nile. It derived its name from Menelaus, abrother of Ptolemy Lagus, and attained such import­ance as to confer the title of Menelaites upon theCsnopic branch of the river. (Ptol. iv. 5. § 9; Strab.ii. p.S0I.) [W. B. D.] MENESTHEI POBTUS (4 Mtrureius a.^i-),a hirUur of Hispania Baetica, between Gades andA>ta. (Strab. iii. p. 140; Ptol. ii. 4. § 5; Man-inn.u. 40.) In its neighbourhood was the oracle ofMrnestheus (Strab. /. c), to whom, also, the in­habitants of Gades offered sacrifices. (Philostr. Vit.Apoll. v. 1.) The Scholiast on Thucydides (i. 12)relates that Menestheus, being expelled by theTbeeidae, went to Iberia. The harbour is probablytlit modern Puerto de S. Maria. HEXINX (Miju-yJ, al. Mr>rv{), an island offthe N. coast of Africa, to the SE. of the LesserSyrtia. It is first described by Scylax (p. 48),who calls it Braciiion (Bpagf {up), and states thatHa length was 300 stadia, while its breadth wassomething less. Pliny (v. 7) makes the length2.3 II. P. and the breadth 22 M. P. Its distancefrom the mainland was about 3 stadia (8 stadia,Siadiam. p. 455), and one day's sail from Taricheae.It was the abode of the "dreamy Lotos-eaters"[Lotophagi], for which reason it was called Lo-tophagitis (Attrro^xryiVit, Ptol. iv. 3. § 35;AsnjQdytfr ptjo-os, Polyb. i. 39 ; comp. Strab. i.r 25. ii. p. 123, iii. p. 157, xvii. p. 834; Pomp.'Mela, ii. 7. § 7; Plin. I. c. ix. 60 ; Dionys. v. 180).The Bomans first became acquainted with it, by thedisastrous expedition of C. Scmpronius Blaesus,a.c 253. (I'olyb. I. c.; comp. Zonar. viii. 14;One. iv. 9.) It contained two towns, Meninx andThoar, and was the birthplace of the emperorsGalhts Trebonianus, and his son, Volusianus (Aurel.Victor, Epit. 31), when it was already knuwn bythe name of Gikba. Jtrbah, as the island is nowcalled, produces the u lotus Zizypbus," a tree-fruitlie beans. (Shaw, Trac. p. 197; Rcnnell, Geog.oflimd. vol. ii. p. 287; Barth, Wandcrungen,pp. S63. 287.) [E. B. J.] 1IEXXIS (Curt. v. 1. § 16), a Bmall town ofMesopotamia, at which Alexander halted in bismarch from Arbeht to Bubylon. Curtius statedthit it was celebrated for its naphtha pits,—which■noted abound in that part of Asia. [V.] MESOBA (Pun. iii. 1. a. 3) or MENUBA (In-str.ap, Florez, Esp. Sagr. ix. p. 47), a tributary ofthe river Baelis, on its right side, now the Gua-dunmr. HEXOSCA (Mm-do-a-o, Ptol. ii. 6. § 9; Plin. iv.JO. a 34), a town of the Varduli, on the N. coast ofKtepmia Tarraconensis. Its site is uncertain. SomepUce it at Si.

Its site is generallyhaierfd to have been that of the modem MainrolA,oar Ctilmbach. [L. S.] HENTESA. 1. Snmamed Bastia {it. Anton.p.402; Uentiasa, Liv. xxvi. 17; Mwriffa, Ptol. ii.*■ i 59), a town of the Oretani in Hispania Tarra-c:ca,9te,on the road from Carthago Nova to Castulo,a*! 22 Koman miles from Castulo. Pliny (iii. 3.a. 4) calls the inhabitants " Mentesani, qui et Ore-tui," to distinguish them from the following. 2. A small state of the Bastuli, in HispaniaBaetica. (*'Mentesani, qui et Bastuli," Plin. I. c;Inscr. Grater, p. 384, 2; Florez, £tp. Sagr. v.p. 24.) MKNT0N0M0N, an aestuary or bay of theNorthern Ocean, mentioned by Pytheas, upon whichthe Guttones dwelt, and at a day's sail from whichwas an island named Abalus, where amber wasgathered. (Plin. xxxvii. 7. s- 11.) The same islandis mentioned in another passage of Pliny (iv. 13. s.27), as situated a day's sail from the Scythian coast.In Sillig's edition of Pliny this part of Scythia iscalled Raunonia ; but some of the MSS. and oldereditions have Bannonianna or Bantomannia, whichis apparently only another form of Mentonomon.The bay was no doubt on the Prussian coast in theBaltic. (Zeuss, Die Dtutschen. $c. p. 269.) MENTORES (Me>ropes), a Libumian tribe(Hecatae. Fr. 62, ed. Klausen; Plin. iii. 21. s. 25),off whose coast were the three islands called Men-torides, probably the same as the rocky islands ofPago, Osero, and Arhe. [E. B. J.] MENU'THIAS (MfKouflms, Steph. B.), an islandoff the E. coast of Africa. Ptolemy (iv. 8. § 2,comp. vii. 2. § 1) describes it as being adjacent(ToodjcciTai) to the Prom. Prasum; at the sametime he removes it 5° from the continent, and placesit at 85° long., 12° 30' hit., to the NE. (a»o 3e-ptvuv di'aroAui') of Prasum. The graduation ofPtolemy's map is here so erroneous, that it is im­passible to make out the position of his islandMenuthias, which some have identified with one ufthe islands of Zanzibar, or even with Madagascar.(Vincent, Navigation of the Ancients, vol. ii. pp.174—185; Gosselin, Geographic des Anciens, vol. i.pp. 191,195.) The simple narrative of the Periplusgives a very faithful picture of this coast, — har­monising with the statements of Ptolemy and Ma-rinus of Tyre,—as far as the Rhaptus of the former(Govind, or the river of Jubah). Afterwards itthus proceeds (p. 9, ed. Hudson):— "Thence" (from the Nova Fossa, "New Cut,"or " Channel," or the opening of the coral reefs byGovind), "at the distance of two natural days' sail,on a course a little above Libs (S\V.), Menuthiasisland occurs on the W. (the important words " DuoWest"—trap* avr))vr^vivaiy—are arbitrarilyalteredia Blancard's edition to the opposite sense, with aview to force the author into agreement with Pto­lemy; comp. Annot. ad Hudson, p. 68), about300 stadia from the mainland, low, and coveredwith wood, with streams, plenty of birds of variouskinds, and land-turtle. But, excepting crocodiies,which are harmless, it has no other animals. Atthis island there are boats, both sewed together, andhollowed out of single trunks, which are used forfishing, and catching turtle. Here, they take fishin wicker baskets, which are let down in front ofthe hollows of the rocks." It appears, therefore,that Menuthias was distant about two days' sailfrom Nova Fossa, or 60 or 80 miles from the riverGevind, just where an opening in the coral reefs isnow found. The coasting voyager, steering SW.,reached the island on the E. side,—a pruof that itwas close to the main; a contiguity which perhapsis further shown by the presence of the crocodiles;though much stress cannot be laid upon this point, asthey may have been only lizards. It is true, thenavigator says that it was 300 stadia from themainland; but as there is no reason to suppose thathe surveyed the island, this distance must be taken

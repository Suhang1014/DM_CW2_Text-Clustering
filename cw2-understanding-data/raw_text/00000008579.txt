Thin townwas probably situated in the fertile plain below themodern Me.ssaria. The name of the town seems tobe derived from the wine grown in its neighbour!modon the slopes of Mount Pramnus, though othersbelieve that the Icarian Oenoe was a colony of theAttie town of the same name. (Comp. Ross, Reisenavfden (Jriech. Inseln, ii. pp. 159, 162.) 2.

B. $. r.), a small townin the Argeia, west of Argos, on the left bank ofthe river Charadrus, and on the southern (the Pri-nus) of the two roads leading from Argo^ to Man-tine i a. Above the town was the mountain Arte-inisium (Malevos), with a temple of Artemis on thefcuminit, woi^hijijjed by the inhabitants of Oenoeunder the name of Oenoatis (OiV&jaTis). Thetown was named by Diomedes after his grandfatherOeneus, who died here. In the neighbouring! ofthis town the Athenians and Argives gained a vic­tory over the Lacedaemonians. (Paus. ii. 15. § 2,i. 15. § 1, x. 10. § 4; Apollod. i. 8. § 6; Steph. B.f.r.) Leake originally placed Oenoe near tlie lefthank of the Charadrus; hut in his later work helias changed his opinion, and supposes it to havestood near the right bank of the Inachus. Hisoriginal supposition, however, seems to be the cor­rect one; since there can be little doubt that Rosslias rightly described the course of the two roadsleading from Argos to Mantineia. (Leake, Morea,vol. ii. p. 413, Pelopon. p. 206; Ross, Reisen imPelopoiittes, p. 133.) 5. Or Bokokoa, a town of Elis, near the Ho­meric Ephyra. (Strab. viii. p. 338.)

That country was inhabited at ti period when the Greeks first became acqsatrs, with it, and becan to colonise its shores, by a t*^whom they called Oenotri or Of.^otkii (Ojw*|or Olfii^Tptui). Whether the appellation was a Stional one, or was even known to the people tfc*selves, we have no means of judging; but the Gnwriters mention several other tribes in the sa-~w pof Italy, by the names of Chones, Morgetes, 1Itali, all of whom they regarded as of the siJ-f nwith the Oenotrians; the two former being eirracalled Oenotrian tribes [Chores; MenGrnwhile the name of Itali was, according to th* icount generally received, applied to the fer.iniin general.

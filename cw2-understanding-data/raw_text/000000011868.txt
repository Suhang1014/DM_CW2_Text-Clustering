V.] THE PEOPLES OF THE NORTH. 179 with the distinction between the Germans and the Celts,and who includes the Cimbri, many of whom he must him­self have seen, among the Germans; and lastly, by the verynames of the peoples and the statements as to their physicalappearance aDd habits in other respects, which, while ap­plying to the men of the north generally, are especiallyapplicable to the Germans. On the other hand it is con­ceivable enough that such a horde, after having wanderedperhaps for many years and having doubtless welcomed everybrother-in-arms who joined it in its movements near to orwithin the land of the Celts, would include a certain amountof Celtic elements; so that it is not surprising that menof Celtic name should be at the head of the Cimbri, or thatthe Romans should employ spies speaking the Celtic tongueto gain information among them.

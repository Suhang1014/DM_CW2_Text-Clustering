It lay on the W. bank of the Ses-sites (Sesta); but perhaps the ancient town shouldbe sought at Borgo Vercelli, about 2 miles from themodern city. In the time of Strabo it was an un-fortified village {I. &), but subsequently became astrong ami not unimportant Roman municipium.(Tac, Hist. i. 70 ; cf. De ctar. Orator. 8 ; alsoOrell. Inscr. 3044, 3945.) Here the highroadfrom Ticinum to Augusta Praetoria was crossed bya road running westwards from Mediolanum. (Itin.Ant. pp. 282, 344, 347, 350.) At the beginning ofthe 5th century it was rapidly falling to decay.(Hieron. Epist 17.) There were some cold minesat a place called Ictimuli, or Vicus Ictimuiorum, inthe district of Vercellae (Strab. I. c.\ Plin. xxxiii.4. s. 21), which must have been of considerable im­portance, as tlie hist cited authority mentions a lawforbidding that more than 5000 men should be em­ployed in them. The true position of these mineshas, however, been the subject of some dispute. Thequestion is fully discussed by Durandi in his treatiseDell" antica Condizione del Ytrcellese. The citywas distinguished for its worship of A]«>llo, whenceit is called Apollineae Vercellae by Martial (x. 12.1); and there was in its vicinity a grove, and per­haps a temple sacred to that deity (Sfat. Silr. i. 4.59), which is prubably to be sought at a small placecalled Polhne, at the foot of the Alps. (Cf. Cic.Fam. xi. 19; Plin. iii. 17. s. 21; Bellini, Antichitadi Vercelli.) [T.

Vere-tinus: Sta Maria di Vtrtto), a town of Calabria,in the district or territory of the Sallentines, andwithin a few miles of the lapygian promontory.Strabo tells us that it was formerly called Baris,and describes it as if it were a seaport town; butboth Pliny and Ptolemy rank it among the inlandtowns of the Sallentines; and there seems no doubtthat its site is marked by the old church of StaMaria di l'erefo,the name of winch is found on oldmaps, between the villages of Salve and Jioggiano,about fj miles from the Capo di Leuca, and 10 fromUgento, the correct distance given in the Tabulafrom Uxentum to Veretum.

The " ager Vc-retinus" is mentioned also in the Liber Coloniarum(p. 202) anions* the " civitates Calabriae," and doubt­less comprised tlie whole district as far as thelapvgian promontorv. [E.

It is not indeed men­tioned by either Livy or Polybius in their circum­stantial accounts of the battle, but it is noticed byboth I- lorus and Valerius Maxim us in connection witha story that seems to have been current among theRomans, that its course was choked up by the deadbodies of the slain, to such an extent that the Car­thaginian troops crossed over them as a bridge.(I'lor. ii. f>. § IS; Vul. .Max. ix. 2, Ext. § 2.)

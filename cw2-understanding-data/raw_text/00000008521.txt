But the rapiditj of Alexander'smovements disconcerted all their plans. He ap­peared at Onchestua in Boeotia, before any intel­ligence had arrived of his quitting tlie north. Hewas willing to allow the Thebans an opportunity forrepentance; but as his proposals of peace wererejected, he directed a general assault upon thecity. The Tlieban troops outside the gates weredriven back, and tlie Macedonians entered the townalong with them. A dreadful carnage ensued;6000 Thebans are said to have been slain, and.'(0,000'to have been taken prisoners. Tlie doom ofthe conquered city was referred to the Grecian alliesin his army, Orebomenians, Plataeans, Phocians,and other inveterate enemies of Thebes. Theirdecision must have been known beforehand. Theydecreed that Thebes should be razed to the ground,with the exception of the Cadmeia, which was tobe held by a Macedonian garrison; that the territoryof the city should be divided among the allies; andthat all the inhabitants, men, women, and childrenshould be sold as slaves. This sentence was carriedinto execution by Alexander, who levelled the city tothe ground, with the exception of the house of Pin­dar (Arrian, Amb. i. 8, 9; Diodor. xvii. 12—14;.liistiii. si. 4.) Thebes was thus blotted out of themap of Greece, and remained without inhabitantsfor the next 20 years. In n.c. 315, Cassanderundertook the restoration of the city. He unitedthe Thcban exiles and their descendants from all[arts of Greece, and was zealously assisted by theAthenians and other Grecian states in the work ofrestoration. The new city occupied the same.areaas the one destroyed by Alexander; and the Cad­meia was held by a garrison of Cassander. (Diodor.xix. 52—54, 78; Pans. ix. 7. § 4.) Thebes wastwice taken by Demetrius, first in B. C. 293, and asecond time in 290, but on each occasion he usedhis victory with moderation. (Plut. Demetr. 39,40; Diod. xxi. p. 491, ed. Wess.) Dicaearchns, who visited Thebes not long after itsrestoration by Cassander. has given a very interestingaccount of the city. "Thebes," lie says (§ 12, seq.ed. Miillcr), " is situated in the centre ol Boeotia,and is about 70 stadia in circumference; its site islevel, its shape circular, and its appearance gloomy.The city is ancient, but it has been lately rebuilt,having been three times destroyed, as history relates*,cm account of the insolence and haughtiness of itsinhabitants. It is well adapted for rearing horsessince it is plentifully provided with water, andabounds in preen pastures and hills: it containsalso better gardens than any other city in Greece.Two rivers flow through the town, and irrigate allthe subjacent plain. There is also a subterraneousstream issuing from the Cadmeia, through pipes,said to be the work of Cadmus. Thebes is a mostagreeable resilience in the summer, in consequenceof the abundance and coolness of the water, its largegardens, its agreeable breezes, its verdant appearance,and the quantity of .summer and autumnal fruits.In the winter, however, it is a most disagreeable resi­dence, from being destitute of fuel, and constantlyexposed to floods and winds. It is then often coveredwith snow and very muddy." Although Dicaearchns * Dicaearchus probably means the capture of thecity by the Kpigoni; secondly by the Pelasgi, duringthe Trojan war; and lastly by Alexander. | in this passage gives to Thebes a arrzsfarr* ti70 stadia, he assigns in his verses (Stat G-ar 53a much smaller extent to it, nameW 43 Ts-latter number is the more provable, and, Wec mmetro was less likely to be altered; but tf tit =«-ber in prose is correct, it probably :nr!o«o uk m-urbs and gardens outside the city walU.

He once came to Alexandria with his brother, who had alongwith him a daughter already marriageable, in order to give herin wedlock to some of the Jews of chief dignity there. He thensupped with the king, and falling in love with an actress, thatwas of great beauty, and came into the room where they feasted,he told his brother of it, and entreated him, because a Jew isforbidden by their law to come near to a foreigner, to concealhis offence, and to be kind and subservient to him, and to givehim an opportunity of fulfilling his desires. Upon which hisbrother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him, andadorned his own daughter, and brought her to him by night, andput her into his bed. And Joseph, being disordered with drink,knew not who she was, and so lay with his brother's daughter;and this did he many times and loved her exceedingly, and saidto his brother, that he loved this actress so well, that he shouldrun the hazard of his life [if he must part with her,] and yetprobably the king would not give him leave [to take her withhim].

After them he sent out the youngest, Hyrcanus, andgave him three hundred yoke of oxen, and bid him go two daysjourney into the wilderness, and sow the land there and yet keptback privately the yokes of the oxen that coupled them together.When Hyrcanus came to the place, and found he had no yokeswith him, he contemned the drivers of the oxen, who advisedhim to send home to his father, to bring them some yokes; buthe thinking that he ought not to lose his time, while they shouldbe sent to bring him the yokes, he invented a kind of stratagem,and what suited an age older than his own; for he slew ten yokeof the oxen, and distributed their flesh among the labourers, andcut their hides into several pieces, and made him yokes, andyoked the oxen together with them; by which means he sowed

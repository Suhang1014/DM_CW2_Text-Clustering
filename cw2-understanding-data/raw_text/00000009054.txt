D.J TURCAE (ToCokoi, Snid. J. r.), a Scythianpeople of Asiatic Sarmatia, dwelling on the PainsAlaeotis, which appears to be identical with the'Iup<ou of Herodotus (iv. 22, &c). The varioushypotheses that have been started respecting theTurcae only show that nothing certain is known re­specting them. (Cf. Manner!, iv. p. 130; Heeren,liken, i. 2, pp. 189, 281, 307; Schafl'arik, Slav. Al-terth, i. p. 318, etc) Humboldt (Central-Atien,i. p. 245, ed. Mahlmann) opposes the notion thatthese Turcae or Jyrcae were the ancestors of thepresent Turks. [T. H. D.J TURCILLNGI, a tribe in northern Germanywhich is not noticed before the fifth century ofour era, and then is occasionally mentioned alongwith the Rugii. (Jornand. Gel. 15; Paul. Diac.i. 1.) [L.8.] TURDETA'XI (TwpJwreW, Ptol. ii. 4. § 5, .Sic),the principal people of Hispania Baetica; whencewe find the name of Turdetania (Tuvpbijrcwia orTovpn/TaWa) used by Strabo (iiL p. 136) and Ste­phanas Byz. (p. 661) as identical with Baetica.Their territory lay to the W. of the river Singulis(now Xenil), on both sides of the Baetis as far awLusitauia on the W. The Turdetani were the mostcivilised and polished of all tlie Spanish tribes.They cultivated the sciences; they had their poeUand historians, and a code of written laws, drawnup in a metrical form (Strab. iiL pp. 139. 151,167;Polyb. xxxiv. 9). Hence they were readily disposedto adopt the manners and customs of their con­querors, and became at length almost entirelyRomans; but with these characteristics we are notsurprised to find that they are at the same timerepresented by Livy (xxxiv. 17) as the most nn-warlike of all the Spanish races. They possessedthe Jus Latii. Some traits in their manners arenoted by Diodorus Sic. (v. 33), Siiius Italicus (iii.340, fteq.), and Strabo (iii. 164). Their superiorcivilisation was no doubt derived from their inter­course with the Phoenicians whose colony ofTartessus lay in their neighbourhood. [T. II. D.J TURDUL1 (TovpooiAoi, Ptol. ii. 4. § 10), apeople in Hispania Baetica, very nearly connectedwith the Turdetani, and ultimately not to be dis­tinguished from them. (Strab. iii. p. 139; Polyb.xxxiv. 9). They dwelt to the E. anil S. of theTurdetani, down to the shores of the Fretum Her-culenm. A branch of them called the TurduliVeteres appears to have migrated into Lusitauia,and to have settled to the S. of the Durius; whereit is probable that in process of time they be­came amalgamated with the Lusitanians (Strab. iii.p. 151; Mela, iii. 1. § 7; Plin. iii. 1. «. 3. iv. 21. s.35; cf.

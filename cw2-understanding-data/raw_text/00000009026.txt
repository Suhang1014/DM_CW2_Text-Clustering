Opuswas believed to be one of the most ancient towns inGreece. It was said to have been founded by Opus,a son of Looms and Protogeneia; and in its neigh­bourhood Deucalion and Pyrrha were reported tohave resided. (Pind. 01. ix. G2, 87; Schol. ad foe.")It was the native city of Patroclus. (Horn. //. xviii.32*1), and it is mentioned in the Homeric catalogueas one of the Locrian towns subject to Ajax, son ofOileus (//. ii. 531). During the flourishing periodof Grecian history, it was regarded as the chief cityof the eastern Locrians, for the distinction betweenthe Opuntii and Epicnemidii is not made either byHerodotus, Thucydides, or Polybius. Eren Strabo,from whom the distinction is chiefly derived, in oneplace describes Opus as the capital of the Epiene-midii (ix. p. 416); and the same is confirmed byPliny (iv. 7. s. 12) and Stephanus (s. v. 'Osnfof;from Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 181.) TheOpuntii joined Leonidas with all their forces atThermopylae, and sent seven ships to the Grecianfleet at Arteinisium. (Herod. eii. 203, viii 1.) Sub­sequently they belonged to the anti-Athenian partyin Greece. Accordingly, after the conquest of Boeotiaby the Athenians, which followed the battle ofOenophyta, B.C 456, the Athenians carried off 100of the richest Opuntians as hostages. (Thuc. i. 108.)In the Peloponnesian War the Opuntian privateersannoyed the Athenian trade, and it was in order tocheck them that the Athenians fortified the smallisland of Atalanta off the Opuntian coast. (Thuc.ii. 32.) In the war between Anttgonua and Cas-lander, Opus espoused the cause of the latter, andwas therefore besieged by Ptolemy, the general ofAntigonua. (Diod. xix. 78.) The position of Opus is a disputed point. Mele-tius lias fallen into the error of identifying it withPundonitaa, which is in the territory of the Kpiene­midii. Many modern writers place Opus at Tdlanda,where are several Hellenic remains; but Leake ob- at Kardhenitza, a village situated an hew to 4asouth-eastward of Tafandtt, at a dihtanct tr-ratj*sea corresponding to the 15 stadia of Stribo, sslwhere exist the remains of an ancient city.

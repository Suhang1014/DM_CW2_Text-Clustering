Wlnle the Romanswere engaged in the siege ofCoriof, and their an cut toilwholly t.iken up with the operations of the besieged wrh-in the walls, and apprehending no danger from without,the Volscian legions marching from Antium, fell suddenÂ­ly upon them, at t:,e same time ihat the besieg-d madea vigorous sally from (he town. Marcius happened tobe then on guard, and pulling himself at the head of aselect corps, he not 'miy repulsed those who had salliedfrom the town, but rushing luriously in at a gaie theyhad opened, and having tilled ihe part of the city thatlay next to him with blood and slaughter, he hastilysnaiched up some fire, and threw it against the housesthat overlooked the wall. The cries of the townsmen, and the shrieks of thewomen and children, when they saw the flames break-in" out, gave the Romans new spirits, and damped theenemy, who found the city was taken, they had cometo relieve. Thus were the Volsci roined, and Coriolitaken at the same time. The glory acquired by Marcius in this war, so fareclipsed the reputation of the consul, that if the treatymade with the Latins, by Sp. Ca"sius alone, whilst hiscolleague was absent, an.I engraven on a pillar of brass,had not handed down to posterity, that Posihumius Co-minius commanded ,in the expedition against the Volsci,his concern there wrould have been totally forgot. This year, the public lost Menenius Agnppa, a man,who through the who e course of his life, had been dearto both senate and people, but still more so to the peopleafter their secession, although he had the honour to bemediator and umpire in the dispute between the orders,although he was chosen delegate from the fathers to thepeop'e, and although he had influence to re-unite thepeople to the senate, he died so poor, that all his estatewas not sufficient to defray the expence of his funeral.That charge was defrayed by the people, who assessedthemselves for that purpose, each in the value of thesixth parth of an ass.* * The one eighth part of a farthing.

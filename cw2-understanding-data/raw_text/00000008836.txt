It rises inuvouiitaiita near Logo Negro, hWs for about 30 miles in a XNK. direction, throngh a broad andlevel upland valley called the Valie di Diano, tillnear Jai Polla it sinks into the earth, and emergesairain through a cavern at a place thence called LaPertusa. This peculiarity is mentioned by Pliny,who calls it "fluvius in Atinate campo," withoutmentioning its name (Plin. ii. 103. s. 106, withHarduin's note): but this is known to us fromVirgil, who notices it in connection with MountAlburn us, which rises immediately to the W. of it,and the epithet "siccus" which he applies to it(*■ sicci ripa Tanagri ") doubtless refers to this samepeculiarity. (Virg. Georg. iii. 151; Serv. ad loe.;Vib. Seq. p. 19.) There is no doubt, also, that inthe Itinerary we should read * Ad Tanagrum" foruAd Tanarum" a station which it places on theroad from Sulernum to Nerulum. (Itin. Ant. p. 109.)The same Itinerary gives a station "Ad Calorem,"as the tiext on this line of route, which seems toshow that the river was then, as now, called in theupper part of its course Calor or Colore, while inthe lower part it assumes the name of Tanagro orNegro. This part of tho route, however, is veryconfused. [E. H. B.] TAN AGRA (ToWypa: Eth. Tavayp<uQ%>. theterritory Tayuypala, Paus. ix. 22. § 1, andTavaypaiidi or Tavarypitci), Strab. ix. p. 404: Adj.Tavaypitcds: Grtmadha or Grhnata), a town ofBoeotia, situated upon the left bank of the Asopus,in a fertile plain, at the distance of 130 stadia f romOropus and 200 from Plataeae (Dicaearch. Stat. Gr.pp. 12. 14, ed. Hudson). Several ancient writersidentified Tanagra with the Homeric Graea (rpala,Horn. // ii. 498; Lycophr. 644); but others supposedthem to be distinct places, and Aristotle regardedOropus as the ancient Graea. (Steph. B. «. v.Tdvaypa; Strab. ix. p. 404 ; Paus. ix. 20. § 2.)It is possible, as Leake has remarked, that Tanagra,sometimes written Tanagraea, may be connected withthe ancient name Graea, Tana, being an Aeolic suffix,and that the modern name Grimddha or Grinuilamay retain traces of the Homeric name. Tanagra wasalso called Poemandria, and its territory Poemandris,fmm the fertile meadows which surrounded the city.(Steph. B. t. v.; Strab. ix. p. 404.) The most ancientinhabitants of Tanagra are said to have been theGephyraei, who cume from Phoenicia with Cadmus,and from thence emigrated to Athens. (Herod, v.57; Strab. ix. p. 404). Prom its vicinity to Atticutbe territory of Tanagra was the scene of more thanone battle. In B. c. 457 the Lacedaemonians ontheir return from an expedition to Doris, took up aposition at Tanagra, near the Ixmlers of Attica, withthe view of assisting the oligarchical party at Alliensto overthrow the democracy. The Athenians, withu thousand Argeians and some Theasalian hor>e,crossed Mount Panics and advanced against theLacedaemonians. Both sides fought with greatbravery; but the Lacedaemonians gained the victory,chiefly through the treacherous desertion of theThessalians in the very heat of the engagement.(Thuc. i. 107, 108; Diod. xi. 80.) At the U*gin-ingof the following year(n. c. 456), and only sixty-two days after their defeat at Tanagra, the Atheniansunder alymniiles again invaded Boeotia, and gainedat Oenophyta, in the territory of Tanagra, a brilliantand decisive victory over the Boeotians, which madethem masters of tbe whole country. The walls ofTanagra were now raxed to the ground. (Thuc i.108; Diod. xi. 81, 82.) I n n. r. 426 the Atheniansmade an incursion into the territory of Tanagra, and

It is indeed noticed by Livy, togetherwith Fregenae and Castrum Novum, as one of tilemaritime colonies which in B. c. 191 contended invain for exemption from military levies (Liv. xxxvi.3); but we have no account of the time at whichthe colony was established there, nor does any sub­sequent mention of it occur in that capacity. Itsname is mentioned by all the geographers amongthe towns on the coast of Etruriaj but Strain) termsit only a small town (iroAtx*'")*'), and Servius callsit in his time merely a fort (castellum), whichwould agree well with the character of the remains.(Strab. v. p. 225; Wei. ii. 4; I'lin. iii. 5. s. 1; I'tol.ill. 1. § +: Martial, xii. 2; Serv. adAen. I.e.) Butin the time of Kutilins it had altogether sunk intodecay, and its site was occupied only by a largevilla. (Rutil. J tin. i. 223.) No subsequent noticeof it is found until it reappears in the middle agesunder the title of .SVi»f<; Severa. The Itineraries vary much in the distances theyassign between Pyrgi and the other stations on thecoast; but they agree in placing it between Alsiumand Castrum Novum: and this circumstance,coupled with the distance of 50 stadia from Caere,given by Strabo, leaves no doubt that it is correctlyidentified with Sta Severn. (Strab. v. p. 220; I tin.Ant. pp. 290. 301; Itin. Mnrit. p. 498; Tab. Peat.)The site of the fortress of that name is unquestion­ably that of an ancient city. The walls of thepresent castle, which is of mediaeval date, are basedon foundations of very ancient character, being con­structed of polygonal blocks of stone of large size,neatly fitted together without cement, in the same-manner as the walls of Cosa and Saturnia. The lineof these foundations, which are undoubtedly those ofthe walls of the ancient city, may be traced through­out their whole exteid. enclosing a quadrangular spaceof alxmt half a mile in circuit, abutting on the sea.Some remains of Roman walls of later date occur atthe extremities on the sea-coast; hut no remainshave been found of the celebrated temple whichwas probably situated within the enclosure; nor arethere any traces of the ancient port, which musthave been wholly artificial, there being no naturalinlet or harbour. (Canina, in the Ann. dclt Inst.Arch. IS40, pp. 35—44; Dennis, Ktruria, vol. ii.pp. 11 —16.) The goddess to whom the templewas dedicated is called by Strabo Eileithyia, butseveral other writers call her Leucothea (Arist. i/. c.; Polyaen. I. c), who was identified with theMater Matuta of the Romans. There is no doubtthat the same deity is meant by both appel­lations. (Gerhard, Outthciteu ikr EtrmWr. pp. 9,25.) [E.H.

It was situated between HeracleopolisMagna and Arsinoe, near the point of junction bc-twecu the Bahr Jusef'and the Nile. The modernvillage of EL Lahum occupies a portion of the siteof the Arsinoite Ptolemais. 2. Ptolemais Theron (riToAe/uair &ripur, Ptol. 1. 8. § 1, iv. 7. § 7, viii. 16. § 10; nr0Ae,uofs,Strab. xvii. pp. 768—76 ; Agatharch. ap. P/tvt.pp. 457—459, ed. Bekkcr; Ptolemais Epitheras, Plin.vi. 29. s. 34), was originally an Aethiopian villagesituated on the southern skirts of the forest whichextended from the S. side of the Troglodytic Bere­nice to lat. 17° N. Its convenient situation on thecoast of the Red Sea and in the heart of the regionwhere elephants abounded induced Ptolemy Phila-delpbus (b. o. 282—246) to occupy, enlarge, andfortify the village, which thenceforward was namedPtolemais after its second founder. Philadelphia,indeed, before he colonised this outpost of his king­dom, used every effort to persuade the Actbiopiauhunters [ELEniAHToriiAoi] to abstain from theflesh of these animals, or to reserve a portion atleast of them for the royal stables. But they re­jected his offers, replying that for the kingdom ofAegypt they would not forego the pleasure of hunt­ing and eating elephants. Hitherto the Aegyptianshad imported these animals from Asia, the Asiaticbreed being stronger and larger than the African.But the supply was precarious; the cost of import­ation was great; and the Aethiopian forests affordedan ample supply both for war and the royal house­hold. As the depot of the elephant trade, includingthat also in hides and ivory, Ptolemais attained ahigh degree of prosperity, and ranked among theprincipal cities of Aethiopia. From its market itis probable that Carthage also derived its supply ofelephants, since about the period of Philadelphia'reign the Carthaginians employed these animalsmore frequently in war. (Liv. xvii. Epit. \ Florus, ii. 2. §28.)Ptolemaishad, properly speaking, no harbour,and the Ae^-yptian vessels were compelled to run upto Berenice whenever the N. or E. winds prevailed;in the present day the Red Sea coast at this point isapproachable only by boats. The roadstead of Pto­lemais, however, was partially sheltered from the E.winds by an island corered with olive-trees. In its x x a

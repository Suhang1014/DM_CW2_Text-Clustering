In like mannerthe Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together,and feasted on the fourteenth day and that which followed it;whence it is, that even now all the Jews that are in the hab­itable earth keep these days festival, and send portions to oneanother,. Mordecai also wrote to those Jews that lived in thekingdom of Artaxerxes to observe these days, and celebrate themas festivals, and to deliver them down to posterity, that this festi­val might continue for all time to come, and that it might neverbe buried in oblivion, for since they were about to be destroy­ed on these days by Haman, they would do a right thing, uponescaping the danger in them, and on them inflicting punishmentson their enemies, to observe those days, and give thanks to Godon them: for which cause the Jews still keep the foremention-ed days, and call them * days of Phurim [or Purim."] AndMordecai became a great and illustrious person with the king,and assisted him in the government of the people.

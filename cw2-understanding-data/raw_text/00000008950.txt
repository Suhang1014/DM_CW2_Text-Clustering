It wastaken b. c. 411 by Archelaus, who removed its site20 stadia from the sea. (Diodor. xiii. 49.) After­wards it was gained for Athens by Timotheus; butin the two first years of the disastrous Social War(358—356), Pydna, about the exchange of whichfor Amphipolis there had been a secret negotiation,was betrayed to Philip by a party of traitors in thetown. (Demosth. adv. Leptinem, p. 476. § 71,OlutUJi. i. p. 10. § 5, Ohjnth. ii. p. 19. § 6; Ulpian,ad he.; Theopompus, Fr. 189, ed Didot.) SeveralAthenian citizens were taken in Pydna, and soldinto slavery, whom Demosthenes ransomed fromhis own funds. (Plut. Vit. X. Orator, p. 851,vol. ix. p. 381, ed. Ileiske.) Towards the close ofthe year B.C. 316, Olympias retired to Pydna,where she was besieged by Cassander, and takenprisoner by him. (l)ioilor. xix. 49; Polyaen. iv. 11.§ 3.) In the spring of B.C. 169, Perseus abandon­ing Diuin, retreated before the consul Q. MarciusPliilippus to Pydna. (Liv. xliv. 6.) After againoccupying the strong line of the Enipeus, Perseus,in consequence of tho dexterous flank movement ofP. Scipio Nasica, was compelled to fall bark uponPydna. On the 22nd of June, B. c. 168 (aneclipse fixes the date, Clinton, H. vol. iii. p.82), the fate of the Macedonian monarchy wasdecided in a plain near the town, which was traversedby a small river, and bordered by heights affording aconvenient retreat and Bhelter to the light infantry,while the plain alone contained the level groundnecessary for the phalanx. (Liv. xliv. 32 — 46;Plut. Aemil. 13—23.) Tho Epitomiser of Straboand a Scholiast upon Demosthenes (Olynth. i. p.10) assert that the Khpos of their time was thesame place as Pydna; but their authority is of nogreat weight, and Colonel Leake (A'orfAem Greece,vol. iii. pp. 429—435) has shown that the ancientsite is better represented by Aydn, where there areHellenic remains, and, on the slope towards the sea,ta'o " tumuli," probably monuments of the battle.Kitro, it may be supposed, rose upon the decayof Pydna and Methone, between which it lies.For autonomous coins of Pydna, see Eckhel, vol.ii. p. 76.

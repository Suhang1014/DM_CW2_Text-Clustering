The right of primoge­niture excluded them from the throne; the injustice oftheir elder brother defrauded them of a legacy of abouttwo millions sterling; some vain titles were not deem­ed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power;and they repeatedly conspired against their nephew,before, and after, the death of his father. Their firstattempt was pardoned: for the second offence theywere condemned to the ecclesiastical state; and for thethird treason, Nicephorus, the eldest and most guilty,was deprived of his eyes, and his four brothers, Chris­topher, Nicetas, Anthemeus, and Eudoxas, were punish­ed, as a milder sentence, by the amputation of theirtongues. After five years'confinement, they escaped tothe church of St. Sophia, and displayed a pathetic spec­tacle to the people. Countrymen and Christians (criedNicephorus for himself and his mute brethren), beholdthe sons of your emperor, if you can still recognize ourfeatures in this miserable state. A life, an imperfect life,is all that the malice of our enemies has spared. It isnow threatened, and we now throw ourselves on yourcompassion. The rising murmur might have produceda revolution, had it not been checked by the presence ofa minister, who soothed the unhappy princes with flat­tery and hope, and gently drew them from the sanctuaryto the palace. They were speedily embarked for Greece,and Athens was allotted for the place of their exile. Inthis calm retreat, and in their helpless condition, Nice­phorus and his brothers were tormented by the thirst ofpower, and tempted by a Sclavonian chief, who offeredto break their prison, and to lead them in arms, and inthe purple, to the gates of Constantinople. But theAthenian people, ever zealous in the cause of Irene,prevented her justice or cruelty; and the five- sonsof Copronymus were plunged in eternal darkness andoblivion.

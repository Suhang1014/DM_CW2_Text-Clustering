ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 423 reproaches, he cried out most of all, and exaggerated what theysaid, as if they had confessed thc design against him, and tookhis oath that he had rather lose his life than hear such reproach­ful words. At last he said, That "he had sufficient authority"both by nature, and by Cajsar's grant to him, [to do what he"thought fit.] He also added an allegation of a law of their"country which enjoined this. That if parents laid their hands"on the head of him that was accused, the standers by were obli-"ged to cast stones at him, and thereby toslay him, which though"he was ready to do in his own country and kingdom, yet did"he wait for their determination: that yet they came thither"not so much as judges, to condemn them for such manifest"designs against him, whereby he had almost perished by his"sons' means, but as persons that had an opportunity of showing"their detestation of such practices, and declaring how unworthy"a thing it must be in any, even the most remote, to pass"such treacherous designs [without punishment."] 3.

Book XIX. dius had gone out before, Cains turned aside into a private narrowpassage, in order to go to the place for bathing, as also in orderto take a view of the boys that came out of Asia, who were sentthence, partly to sing hymns in these mysteries which were nowcelebrated, and partly to dance in the pyrric way of dancingupon the theatres. So Cherea met him, and asked him for thewatch-word ; upon Caius's giving him one of his ridiculouswords, he immediately reproached him, and drew his sword, andgave him a terrible stroke with it, yet was not this stroke mor­tal. And although there be those that say, it was so contrivedon purpose by Cherea, that Caius should not be killed at oneblow, but should be punished more severely by a multitude ofwounds, yet does this story appear to me incredible ; becausethe fear men are under in such actions does not allow them touse their reason. And if Cherea was of that mind, I esteem himthe greatest of all fools, in pleasing himself in his spite againstCaius, rather than immediately procuring safety to himself andto his confederates from the dangers they were in -, because theremight many things still happen for helping Caius's escape, if hehad not already given up the ghost; for certainly Cherea wouldhave regard, not so much to the punishment of Caius, as to theaffliction himself and his friends were in, while it was in hispower, after such success, to keep silent, and to escape the wrathof Caius's defenders, and not leave it to uncertainty whether heshould gain the end he aimed at or not, and after an unreasonablemanner to act as if he had a mind to ruin himself, and lose theopportunity that lay before him ; but every body may guess ashe pleases about this matter. However, Caius was staggered'with the pain that blow gave him ; for the stroke of the swordfalling in the middle, between the shoulder and the neck, washin-tlered by the first bone of the breabt from proceeding any farther.Nor did he either cry out, in such astonishment was he, nor did hecall out for any of his friends ; whether it were that he had noconfidence in them, or that his mind was otherwise disordered, buthe groaned under the pain he endured, and presently went for­ward and fled ; when Cornelius Sabinu«, who was alreadyprepared in mind so to do, thrust him down upon his knee,where many of them stood'round about him, and struck him withtheir swords, and they cried out, and encouraged one another allat once to strike him Ejgain; but all agree that Aquila gave himthe finishing stroke, which directly killed him. But one mayjustly ascribe this act to Cherea ; for although many concurred inthe act itself, yet was he the first contriver .of it, and began longbefore all the rest to prepare for it, and was the first man thatboldly spake of it to the rest; and upon their admission of what • he

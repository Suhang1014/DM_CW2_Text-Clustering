Fortissimus quietissimus. Ad rem., cf. Hom. Il. 2, 8 ; 4, 429. 33. Won hercule iill.... German1. Not even those Germanbarbarians, still less you. Hercule is too. ; sometimes mehercule,which is an ellipsis for ita me, Hercule, juries (cf. Z. 361, note) ; or,according to Freund, the me is only a demonstrative prefix for empha­sis. Cf. Freund sub voce ce.—Cum maxime. Cf. note on it, 29. 35. Depoposcerint. Cf. 83: crediderim; 79: obstiterit. Thisuse of the subj. is much more frequent in the later than in the earlierLatin. "Theperf. subj., when used independently, usually has themeaning of a softened future." Z. 527. Zumpt suggests, by way ofexplaining this meaning, that the same form is probably used both forthe subj. perf. and the subj. of the fut. perf., e. g. depoposcerim —subj. both of depoposci and depoposcero. It does not necessarily im­ply doubt. Cf. Cic. Brut. 6: Hoc sine ulla dubitatione confirmaverim,etc. In such questions as this it implies a negative answer. Cf. note,30: mererelur. The use of the perf. subj. after ut and ne (as in utquesic dixerim, G. 2) is entirely peculiar to the silver age. 3T. Praestriiigimus = obumbramus. Al. perstringimus, whichis the reading of the MSS., and is retained by Rup. in the sense ofhebetamus. The departure from the MSS. is justified by Wr., fromthe frequent and easy confounding of those two syllables.—Nationes,imaginem .... exercitus, senatus. Notice the position of these em­phatic words in their respective clauses. > 2. Constiterint. Subj. as usual after the impers. verb. Cf. Gr.'262, R. 3. 3. Domibus. Properly generic, = buildings; tectis, roofs. Ac­cumulated here for emphasis, rather than for distinction. This speechabounds in such emphatic accumulation of words nearly synonymous,e. g. seditionem et discordiam, sanguinem et caedem, splendore etgloria, sordes et obscuritatem. -t. Stare = constare, consistere. Cf. Essay, pp. 10.11. Ad sen-tentiam, compare Liv. 5, 54 ; Dio. 56, 5. 5. Promiscua sunt, agreeing with muta ista in the nom.; insteadof promiscuum est agreeing with the clause. Render: whether thesemute and inanimate objects fall or are rebuilt is a matter of indif­ference. It is a case of attraction, resembling the Greek. Cf. Essay,p. 18.—Aeternitas rerum. The perpetuity of the empire. T. Auspicato. The Romans undertook no great enterprise with­out first ascertaining the will of the gods by auspices. Religion, deeplyseated in the breasts of the people, was the most powerful engine bothof war and of state. This speech is highly characteristic, and plays"

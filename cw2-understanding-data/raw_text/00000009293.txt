He said that 'the terms enjoinedwere so severe and humiliating that, not knowing whatto determine, he had spent the day in deliberation.'But the general opinion was, that he had purposelydelayed the business, that the Achseans and jEtoliansmight not have time to answer him: and this opinionhe- himself confirmed, by desiring, in order to avoidaltercation, and to bring the affair to some conclusion,that the others should retire, and leave him to conversewith the Roman general: for some time, this was notadmitted, lest the allies should appear to be excludedfrom the conference. Afterwards, on his persisting inhis desire, the Roman general, with the consent of all,taking with him Appius Claudius, a military tribune,advanced to the brink of the coast, and the rest retired.The king, with the two persons whom he had broughtthe day before, came on shore, where they conversed aconsiderable time in private. What account of theirproceedings Philip gave to his people is not wellknown: what Quintius told the allies was, that ' Philipwas willing to cede to the Romans the whole coast ofIllyricum, and to give up the deserters and prisoners,if there were any. That he consented to restore toAttalus his ships, and the seamen taken with them;and to the Rhodians the tract which they call Peraea.That be refused to evacuate Iassus and Bargylii. Tothe jUtolians he was ready to restore Pharsalus andLarissa; Thebes he would keep: and that he wouldgive back to the Achasans the possession, not only ofArgos, but of Corinth also.' This arrangement pleasednone of the parties; neither those to whom the conces­sions were to be made, nor those to whom they wererefused; 'for on that plan,' they said, ' more wouldbe lost than gained; nor could the grounds of con­tention ever be removed but by his utterly evacuatingevery part of Greece.'

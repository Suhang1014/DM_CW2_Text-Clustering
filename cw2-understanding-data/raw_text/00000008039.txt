Identified by some with Caluibria, by otherswith Fermotelle or Ciudad Jiodrigo. (Ukert, vol. ii.ptl. p. 431.) 2. A town of the Callalci Lucernes in Gallaecia(Ptol. ii. 6. § 23). 3.

[Euboea.] OCHOSBANES ('OxoffedVnj) or Ochtho-manks, a small river of Paphlagonia, falling intothe bay of Armene, a little to the noith of Sinope.(Marcian. Heracl. p. 72; Anonym. Peripl. Pont.Eitx. p. 7.) This is probably the same river whichScylax (p. 33) calls Ocheraenus. [L. S.] OCHKAS, a place in Cappadocia. (/t. Ant. p.202.) Ptolemy (v. 6. § 12) mentions a placeOdogra or Odoga, in the district of Chammanene inCappadocia, between the river Halys and MountArgaeus, which is possibly the same as the Ochrasof the Antonine Itinerary. [L. S.] OCHUS (o'nxos. St'rab. xi.p. 509; Ptol.vi. 11.§§ 2, 4; Amm. Marc, xxiii. 6), a river of CentralAsia, which has been attributed to the provinces ofHyrcania and Buctriana by Strabo and Ptolemyrespectively, as flowing through them both. Ittook its rise on the N W. side of the Paropamisus(or Hindu-Kush), and flowed in a NW. directionthrough part of Bactriana towards the Caspian Sea,and parallel with the Oxus. Pliny makes it u riverof Bactriana, and states that it and the Osus flowfrom opposite sides of the same mountain (vi. 16.§ 18). There can lie no reason for doubting thatit is represented by the present Tedjen. It is clearthat in this part of Asia all Ptolemy's places arethrown too much to the east by an error in longi­tude.

D.] OCINAKUS ('fliciVopoy), a river on the W. coastof Bruttium, mentionetl only by Lycophron {Alex.729, 1009), who tells us that i; flowed by the cityof Terina. It is generally supposed to be the samewith the Sabatus of the Itineraries (the modernttaruto); but its identification depends upon thatof the site of Terina, which is very uncertain.[Terkia]. [E. H.

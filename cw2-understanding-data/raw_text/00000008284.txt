(Id. xiii. p. 627). "In olden times, itheld the Magnetos [the people of Magnesia on theMaeander] to be utterly destroyed by the Trerea,a Cimmerian tribe." (Id. xiv. p. 647; see also xi.p. 511, xii. p. 573; Cimmehii, Vol. I. p. 623,seq.;Muller, Uui. Lit. Anc. Greece, pp. 108, 109; andcf. Herod, i. 6, 15, 16, 103.) Various attempts have been made to fix the datesof these events; but the means of doing so appearto be wanting, and hence scholars have arrived atvery different conclusions on the subject. Strabointers from some expressions of Callinus that thedestruction of Sardes preceded that of Magnesia,which latter occurred, he considers, after 1 lie timeof that poet, and during tho age of Archil ochus,who alludes to it. Thucydides (ii. 96) states that the kingdom ofSitalces was bounded on the side next to the Triballiby the T re res and Tilataei, who dwelt on the northernslope of Mount Scombrus (Scomius), and extendedtowards the W. as far as the river Oscius (Oescus)."Whether this relative clause applies to the Trereaas well as to the Tilataei is doubtful; but the col­location of tho words seems to confine it to thelatter. Strabo (i. p. 59) speaks of the Trerea as dwellingwith the Tbracians ; and says that the Trerea, whowere Thracians, possessed a part of the Troad afterthe time of Priam (xiii. p. 536). Pliny does not mention the Trerea as a Thraeian[teople; but in the description of Macedonia (iv. 10.s. 17), says that they, with the Dardani and Pieres,dwelt on its borders ; it is not clear, however, whichImrders are meant. (Cf. Theopom. Frag, 313,where they are called Tp«/ies; and Stepb. B. p. 664,where also a district of Thrace inhabited by them isnamed T^ijpos.) It is possible that these Thraeian Treres were thedescendants of a body of the Cimmerian Treres, leftN. of the Haemus when tho main body advanced toAsia Minor; for there can be little doubt that it'ie-buhr's view residing the course of their inroads iscorrect. ''The general opinion, which is presupposedifi Herodotus also, is that the Cimmerians invadedA>ia Minor from the K., along the coasts of theKuxiue. But it would seem that, on the contrary,they came through Thrace, for they make their firstapi>earance in Ionia and Lydia. The former road isalmost entirely impassable for a nomadic people, asthe Caucasus extends to the very shores of theEuxiiii.*." (LecL Anc. Hist. i. p. 32, note.) In confirmation of t he conjecture above made, wemay refer to the parallel case mentioned by Caesar(Ii. G, ii. 29), that the Aduatuci, a Belgian tribe,were the descendants of the 6000 men whom theCitnbri and Teutoni, on their march towards Italy,left behind them W. of the lihine, to guard that partof their property which they were unable to take withthem any farther.

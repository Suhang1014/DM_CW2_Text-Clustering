At a .still later period the two countrieswere again separated, and liliaetia Proper appearsunder tho name Khaetia Prima, and Vindeliciaunder that of Rhaetia Secunda. We have here tospeak only of the latter or Vindelicia, as it appears in the time of Augustus, when it was botxli^ *the north by Germania Magta, that U. U ttsDanube and the Vallum Hadnani or Licei, awest by the territory of the Heiretii. on the wl2by Khaetia, and on the east by Xor^ur, tsawhich it was separated by the river Orra t/wtThe line of demarcation between Vir^U-*Khaetia is not mentioned anywhere, hot wis b i~probability formed by the ridce of tbe KL»*u2Alps.

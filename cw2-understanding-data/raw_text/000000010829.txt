HE next night the Volsci, confidmg in the differ­ences that subsisted among the Romans, made au attemptupon their camp, expecting to find some under cover ofthe night, who would either desert to them, or betraythe rest. They were discovered by the guard, an alarmspread, and upon a signal given, they ran to arms. Thuswere the Volsci disappointed in their design; and bothparties, for the remainder of that night, continued quiet.Next morning early, the Volsci having filled up theditches, made an attack upon the rampart. Alreadyhad they begun to break down the pallisadoes op allsides, but the consul, willing to try the mettle of his sol­diers, delayed coming to action for some time, althoughthe soldiers from every quarter, especially the debtors,cried out to him to give the signal. But now, convincedof their ardour, he at length gave the word of command,and the soldiers eager to attack, made a general sallyfrom every gate of the camp. The enemy unable to stand so vigorous a charge, wereput to flight; the foot pursued, and put all to the swordthey could overtake. The rest'were driven in great con­sternation by the horse to their camp, which was imme­diately invested by the legions, soon after deserted bythe Volsci in a panic, and taken and plundered by thesoldiers. The enemy fled to Suessa Pometia, whither the Ro­man legions pursued them, the day after. In a fewdays tlie city was taken, and given to be plundered bythe soldiers, which was some relief in their present dis­tress. The consul marched back his victorious army toRome, with the greatest glory. When he was appliedto by the deputies of the Ecetrans, who were a part ofthe Volsci, and after Pometia was taken, were afraid forthemselves, the senate, by their decree, granted thempeace, but their lauds were taken from them.

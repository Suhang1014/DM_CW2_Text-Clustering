Book XI- * how thej' might enjoy those blessings for all time to come.u And whereas I have been kindly informed by Haman, who"on account of his prudence and justice, is the first in my esteem,"and in dignity, and only second to myself for his fidelity and"constant good will to me, that there is an ill natured nation in-"termixed with all mankind, that is averse to our laws, and"not subject to kings, and of a different conduct of life from"others, that hateth monarchy, and of a disposition that is per-"nicious to our affairs, I give order that all these men, of whom"Haman our second father, hath informed us, be destroyed,"with their wives, and children, and that none of them be spared,"and that none prefer pity to them before obedience to this de-"cree.

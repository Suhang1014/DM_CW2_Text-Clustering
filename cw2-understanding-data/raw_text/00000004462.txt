Dru­sus seized this moment, and read his father's letter,in substance stating, that Tiberius had nothing somuch at heart as the interest of the gallant legionswith whom he had served in so many wars. As soonas his grief for the loss of Augustus allowed him lei­sure, it was his intention to refer the case of the armyto the wisdom of the senate.

[Gallabcia, Vol.I.p. 034, a.] NAKBO MABTIUS (h Nd/>g«v: Kth. N«p£o>-vr}(rio$t Nap€aJviT^y, Kap^alos. Narbonensis: Nar-bonne), a town of the Prowncia or Gailia Nar-honensis. Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 9) enumerates itanion" tlie inland towns of the Voleae Tectosajrcs,under the name of Narbon Colonia. He places itlive minutes south of the latitude of Massalia {Mar­seille), and in 43° X. Int. It is, however, bomeminutes north of 43° N. Int., and more than fiveminutes south of Massalia. Hi ppa rebus placedNarbo and Massalia nearly in the same latitude.(Strab. ii. p. 106.) Narbo was on the Atax(Awle), and xii. M. P. from the sea. (Plin. iii. 4.)Pliny seems to place Narbo in the territory of theYoleae Teetosages, but his text is obscure. Slrabo(iv. p. 18G) distinctly places Narbo in the territory ofthe Voleae Arecomici, but lie adds that Nemaususwas their chief city. It seems, indeed, more pro­bable that the Voleae Arccninici possessed the coastabout Narbo, for the chief city of the Teetosa£eswas Tolosa {Toulouse), in the basin ol the Garonne.Mela (ii. 5) calls Narbo a colonia of lh<* Atacini[Atax] and the I>ecuinani. Ausonius (DeClaris I rbibus, Narbo) does not say, as some havesupposed, that Narbo was in the territory of theTeetosages, but that the TecU^ages formed thewestern part of Narbonensis, which is true. Theconclusion from Caesar (A'. G. vii. C) is that Narbowas not in the country of the Arecomici; but Caesardid not trouble himself about such matters. The position of Narbo at Narbonne is easily de­termined by the name, by the river Atax. and bythe measures alonff the road from Italy into SpainThe road from Arelatc {Aries) through Nemansus(Nimes), Cessero {Si. Tiberi), and Baeterrae (Be-ziers) to Narbo, is in the Antonine 11 in. There isalso a route both in the Antonine Itin. and in theTable from BurdigaU (Bordeaux), through Tolosa(Tonlotut)and Carcasso (Carcassonne) to Narbo. The name Narbon (?; Ndffe) was also onename of the river Atax, for Polybius calls the riverNarbon. [Atax.] The form Narbona occurs ininscriptions; and there is authority for tins formalso in the MSS. of Caesar. (B. G. iii. 20, cd. Schn.,and viii.46.) According to Stephanus (.-?. v.) Mar-cianus calls it Narboneaia; but this is clearly anadjective form. Hecataeus, who is the authorityfor the Ethnic name t*ctf*€aiot, must have supposeda name Narha or Narbe. The origin of the nameMartins is not certain. The Roman colony of Naibowas settled, ii. c. 118, in the consulship of Q. Mar-cius Rex and M. Porcius Cato; but the founder ofthe colony was L. Licinius Crass us. (Cic. Brut. \ c. 43.) It has been conjectured that the nam*I Martins was given to the place because of the war-! like natives of the country against whom thesettlers had to protect themselves. But thi* b nolprobable. Others, again, have conjectured tbrt itsname is derived from the Legio Martia (Veil. Piter,ii. 8. ed. Bnnnann); and the orthojErraphT Martaiidefended by an inscription, Narbo Mart. (Grafer,cexxix.), and a coin of Goltzins. To this it is ob­jected, by a writer quoted by t'kert (Galticn. p. 410),that the Legio Martia was first fonned by Aurttstu,and that Cicero mentions the titie Martins. (AdFum. x. 33.) Forbiger copies Ukert. It spfwnithat neither of them looked at Cicero's letter, inwhich he speaks, not of Narbo Martins or Marnn*,but of the Legio Martia, which existed before tiwtime of Augustus. Cicero, however, d<ies speak dNarbo Marcius, as it stands in Orelli's text. (/VoFont c. I.) The Latin MSS. write the word I-**Marcius and Martins; and the same variation oetvatin many oilier words of the same termination. Tb#most probable conclusion is tliat the name Ma»tnJor Marcius is the name of the consul Marcius(b-C.lis), who was fighting in this year against a I>gurian people, named Sineni. The name may bit*ln-ou written Narbo Marcius in Cicero's time, ualafterwards corrupted. Narbo was an old town, placed in a good pv?Ti-«on the road into Spain and into the basin <»f th?Garonne; a commercial place, we may oerui^yassume, from the earliest time of itn ex teepee.There was a tradition that the country of N»r-bonne was once occupied by Bebrrces. (I>ii<iC5«.Fray. Vales, vi. ed. Reim., and the reference to Z*naras.) The earliest w riter who mentions KarS* aHecataeus. rjuoted by Stephanus; and, accordirj-ywe conclude that Narbo was well known to tb*Greeks in the fifth century before the Clrri>tialaera. The first Roman settlement in South Gx'.Uwas Aquae Sextiae (Aix), on the cast side of :hiRhone. The second was Narbo Marcius, by wbkithe Romans secured the road into Spain. Cioncalls Narbo a colony of Roman citizens, a wvrjtower of the Roman people, and a bulwark opt**—iand placed in front of the nations in th-oe ju.-i*.During Caesars wars in Gallia this Roman cotor^was an important position. When P. Crasvoa iivaded Aquitania (b. c. 56) he pot help from ToJ-*iCarcaso. and Narbo. at all which places then »«a muster-roll of the fighting men. (B. G. iit. 2\\I In the preat rising of the Galli (n. c. 52), Nariwas threatened by Lneterius, but Caesar e»"T* 1its relief. (B. G. vii. 7.) A second colony irisettled at Narbo, or the old one rather strvrirtlr-ned by a sup]»lein> nlum under the dictator Cms*(Sueton. Tiber, c. 4) by Tilierius Claudius iierthe father of the emperor Tiberius. San* rf tltenth legion, Caesar's favourite legion, were s^tikhere, as we may infer from the name DecumancM; Colonia. (I'lin. iii. 4.) The name Julia Paterawhich appears on inscriptions and in Martial,derived from the dictator Caesar. The e?*»r<li*iincut of Narbo was the cause of the d*rlin«Massilia. Strabo, who wrote in the time rf Ai1 gustus and Tiberius, says (iv. p. 186): " that NajH, is the port of the Voleae Arecomici, but it it it,more properly be called the port of tb# res*Celtice; so much does it surpass other to-wrsstrade." (The latter part of Strabo's text is e»»rnhere.) The tin of the north-west part of the Sia^jpeninsula and of Britain passed by way of N*rt*-x.

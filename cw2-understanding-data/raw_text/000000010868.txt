The king's officers and attendants made the bestof their way. He himself quite faint, was returninghome, supported by a small retinue, half dead with fear,and had got to the top of the Cyprian street, when hewas overtaken and slain by a party sent out by Tarquinfor that purpose. This happened, it is thought by Tullia's advice; as shehad been deeply concerned in all the other villainousplots: One thing however is certain, that she drove inher chariot, and without minding the crowd about her,she called her husband out of the senate-house, and wasthe first to salute him king; and being ordered by himto retire out of the crowd, on her way home, when shehad reached the upper part of the Cyprian street, wherelately stood a temple of Diana, as she was wheeling tothe right, towards the Virbian ascent, which was the wayto the Esquiline hill, the charioteer, struck with horror,checked his horses, and made a stop, pointing to the bo­dy of Servius, which lay murdered in the street. Cruel and inhuman is the action that is said to havefollowed upon this; of which the place itself exhibits aproof: they call it the wicked street, in which Tullia,racked and tortured with the furies of her husband andsister, is reported, in a fit of madness, to have driven herchariot over the body of her father, and to have carriedhome on her clothes and chariot, part of his blood, to herown house gods, and those of her husband; who beingjustly provoked at the barbarity of the action, broughttheir. usurpation speedily to an end suited to the wicked­ness of its beginning. The reign of Tullius had been so glorious forforty-fiveyears, that it would have been hard even for a goodprince, a reasonable king, to have filled his place withequal dignity.—This too adds to the glory of his reign'that the just and legal exercise of the royal prerogativefell at the same time with him. Some authors are of opi­nion, that he had it in view to have resigned his power,however mild and moderate the exercise of it had been,because it was absolute, had not the intrigues of his ownfamily cut short his plan of fixing his country's liberty.

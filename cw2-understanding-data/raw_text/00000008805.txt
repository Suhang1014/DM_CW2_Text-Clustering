L.]LACTA'RIUS MOXS (rdXeucros opov: MonteS. Angth), was the name given by the Romans toa mountain in the neighbourhood of Stabiae in Cam­pania. It was derived from the circumstance thatthe mountain abounded in excellent pastures, whichwere famous for the quality of the milk they pro­duced; on which account the mountain was resortedto by invalids, especially in cases of consumption,for which a milk diet was considered particularlybweScial. (Cassiod. Kp. xi. 10; Galen, de Meth.MttL t. 12.) It was at the foot' of this mountainthat Xar?es obtained a great victory over the Guthsunder TeTas in a. d. 553, in which the Gothic kingww 6lain. (Procop, B. G. iv. 35, 36.) The de­scription of the M«»ns Lactarius, and its positionwi'Ji regard to Stabiae, leave no doubt that it was ap*rt of the mountain range which branches off fromtie Apennines near Xocera (Xuceria), and separatesu\» Bay of SapUs from that of Paestum. TheLi^rwst point of this range, the Monte S. Angelo,attains a height of above 5000 feet; the whole rangei* calcareous, and presents beautiful forests, as well*.< abundant pastures. The name of Lettere, stillborne by a town on the slope of the mountain side,a little above Stabiae, is evidently a relic of the an­cient name. [E. H.

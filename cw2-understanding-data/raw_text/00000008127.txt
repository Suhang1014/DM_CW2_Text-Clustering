Archaenpolis,its chief town, was the capital of Colchis, and aplace of considerable importance in the La/.ie war.(Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. ix. p. 217; Gibbon,c. xlii ) [E. B.

[MaUBETASIA.] MUDUTTl. [Moputti.] MUGILLA, an ancient city of Latiuni, mentionedonly by Dionysiua (viii. 36), who enumerates theMugilluni (MfvyiAaiVow) among the places conqueredby Coriolanns, at the head of the Yolscian army.He there mentions them (as well as the Albietes. whoare equally unknown) between thecitizens of Polluscaand Coriuli, and it is therefore probable that Mu-gilla lay in the neighbourhood of thnse cities; but wehave no further clue to its site. The name dues notagain appear, even in Pliny's list of the extinct citiesof Latium; and we should be apt to suspect somemistake, but that the cognomen of Mugillanus,borne by one family of the Papirian Gens, seems toconfirm the correctness of the name.

Journ.vol. vi. p. 302.) [E.B.J.] MUIXCHA, a river of Mauretnnia, which Sallust(Jug. 92, 110), Mela (i. 5. §§ 1, 5), and Pliny (v. 2)assign as the boundary between the Mauri and Mas- |saesyli, or the subjects of Boeehus and Jupiirtha.As Strabo (xvii, pp. 827,829) makes the Mow>cath (MoAox«W, MoKaxdO, Ptol. iv. 1. §7) servethe same purpose, there can be no doubt that theyare one and the same river. The Malva (MaAoi'a,Ptol. I. c.) of Pliny {I.e.), or the Muluwi, whichforms the frontier between Afarocco and Algeria, isthe same as the river which bounded the Moors fromthe Numidians. This river, rising at or near theS. extremity of the lower chain of Atlas, and flow­ing through a diversified country, as yet almostuntrodden by Europeans, falls into the sea nearly inthe middle of the Gulf of Melilah of our charts,(Shaw, Trav. pp. 10—16!)

Strabo (I.e.) says that it is 1400stadia from Cartcia. It was celebrated on accountof two battles fought in its vicinity, the first inB.C. 216. when Cn. Scipio defeated the Cartha­ginians (Liv, xxiv. 42; Sil. Ital. iii. 400), and thesecond in B.C. 45, when Julius Caesar gained avictory over the sous of Poinpey. (Dion Cass. xliii. 39; Auct. Bell.

It is u-iVaiitidentified with the village of Afonda, SW. <-f Malm;but it has been pointed out that in the vicimty ttf u>modern Month, there is no plain adapted fur a feUof battle, and that the ancient city should pn-bibe placed near Cordova. It has been supposed uutthe site of Munda is indicated by the remains <iancient walls and towers lying bftw^n Man><\Alcaioiete, Esjnjo, and Bona. At all events tbasite agrees belter with the statement of Strata, tls*.Munda is 1400 stadia from Carteia, for the distilfrom the modern Monda to the latter place is uon*400 stadia; and it is also more in accordance wvthl'linv. who places Munda between Attubi and Ct»(Forbiger, vol. iii. p 51.) 2.

The march wasopened by the military officers at the head of theirtroops: they were followed in long order by the ma­gistrates and ministers of the civil government: theperson of the emperor was guarded by his eunuchsand domestics, and at the church-door he was solemnlyreceived by the patriarch and his clergy. The taskof applause was not abandoned to the rude and spon­taneous voices of the crowd. The most convenientstations were occupied by the bands of the blue andgreen factions of the circus; and their furious conflicts,which had shaken the capital, were insensibly sunkto an emulation of servitude. From either side theyechoed in responsive melody the praises of the em­peror; their poets and musicians directed the choir,and long life and victory were the burden of everysong. The same acclamations were performed at theaudience, the banquet, and the church; and as anevidence of boundless sway, they were repeated inthe Latin, Gothic, Persian, French, and even Englishlanguage, by the mercenaries who sustained the realor fictitious character of those nations. By the penof Constantine Porphyrogenitus, this science of formand flattery has been reduced into a pompous andtrifling volume, which the vanity of succeeding timesmight enrich with an ample supplement. Yet thecalmer reflection of a prince would surely suggest,that the same acclamations were applied to everycharacter and every reign: and if he had risen froma private rank, he might remember, that his ownvoice had been the loudest and most eager in applause,at the very moment when he envied the fortune, orconspired against the life, of his predecessor *. • For all these ceremonies, see the professed work of Constantine Porphyrogeni­tus, with the notes, or rather dissertations, of his German editors, Leich andReiske.

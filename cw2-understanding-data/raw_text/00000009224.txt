OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 125 peaceable country round: and at length they used toquit their standards without leave, openly, and in theday-time. In a word, every thing was directed by thelicentious humor of the soldiery, nothing by the rulesand discipline of war, or the commands of the officers.The form however of a Roman camp was preserved,merely on account of the hope which they entertainedthat the tribunes would be infected with their madness,and become sharers in their mutiny and revolt. Theytherefore permitted them to hold their courts at thetribunals; they applied to them for the watchword,and mounted guards and watches in their turn ; and asthey had taken away all the power of command, so, bysubmitting from choice to the usual duties, they keptup the appearance of obedience to orders. But whenthey found that the tribunes disapproved and blamedtheir proceedings, that they endeavored to put a stopto them, and openly refused to assist in their designs,the mutiny then burst out; and having, by violence,driven the tribunes from their stands, and soon afterfrom the camp, with the unanimous approbation of thewhole body, they bestowed the supreme command onCaius Albius of Cales, and Caius Atrius of Umbria,common soldiers, who were the principal movers ofthe sedition. These men, not satisfied with the orna­ments used by tribunes, had the assurance to lay holdof the badges of supreme command, the rods and axes;never considering that their own backs and necks werein danger from those very rods and axes which theycarried before them to strike terror into others. Theirgroundless belief of Scipio's death blinded their under­standings; and they entertained not a doubt that, onthe news of that event, which would soon be generallyknown, the ffames of war would break out in everypart of Spain : that during this confusion money mightbe exacted from the allies, and the neighboring citiesplundered; and that the disturbances being general,and all men acting without restraint, their own beha­vior would be the less liable to observation.■ 2d.

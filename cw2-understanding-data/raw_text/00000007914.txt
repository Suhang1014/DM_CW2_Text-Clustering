W.] MALA (Mi\a, Md\»)), a town in Colchis, whichScylax (p. 32), in contradiction to other writers,makes the birthplace of Medeia. [K. B. J.] MALACA (MdAaxa, Strab.; Ptol. ii. 4. § 7;MaAaVn, Steph. B. s. v.: Eth. MaAaxrrai'o'f: Ma-iaga), an important town upon the coast of HispaniaBaetica, cast of Calpe, which was equidistant fromGadeira and Malaca. (Strab. iii. p. 156.) Ac­cording to the Antonine Itinerary (p. 405), the dis­tance from Gadeira to Malaca was 145 miles; ac­cording to Strabo (iii. p. 140) the distance fromGadeira to Calpe was 750 stadia. Malaca stoodupon a river of the same name, now Gvadalmedina.(Avien. Or. Mar. 426 j Malaca cum fluvio, Plin. iii.1. s. 3.) Strabo says (/. c.) that Malaca was builtin the Phoenician fashion, whence we may concludethat it was a Phoenician colony. Accordingly somemodern writers have supposed that the name wasderived from the Phoenician word malcha, " royal;"hut Humboldt says that Malaca is a Basque word,signifying the "side of a mountain." Under theRomans it was a foederata civitas (I'lin. I. c), andhad extensive establishments for salting fish. (Strab.I c.) Avienus says (I. c.) that Malaca was for­merly called Maenaca; bnt Strabo had already no­ticed this error, and observed not only that Maenacawas further from Calpe, but that the ruins of thelatter city were clearly Hellenic. Malaca is alsomentioned in Strab. iii. pp. 158, 161, 163; Hut. B. Alex. 46; Geogr. Kav. iv. 42. There are stilla few remains of Roman architecture in Malaga. MALACHATH (MoAaxdfl), a city of Libya In­terior, which Ptolemy (iv. 6. § 25) places in thecountry above the Nigeir, in E. long. 20° 20', andK. lat. 20° 15'. [E. B. J.] MALAEA. [Malea.] MALAEI COLON (MoAaloo.or MaA<ov k»\oi>,Ptol, vii. 2. § 5), a promontory on the southerncoast of the Golden Chersonesus. Its exact posi­tion cannot be determined, but it was probably alongthe Straits of Malacca. [V.] MALAMANTUS (4 MaAduajToj, Arrian, Ind.c 4), a small tributary of the Cophen, or river ofKolml, perhaps now the Pandjcora. [V.] MALANA (MiAoj-a, Arrian, Ind. c 25), acape which enters the Indian Ocean, and forms thewestern boundary of the Oreitae (one of the sea-coast tribes of Gedrosia) and the Ichthyophagi.There is no doubt that it is the same as the present C. Malan in Mtkran, the measurements of Xearchusand of modem navigators corresponding remarkably.(Vincent, \'<»j. of Xearchus, vol. i. p. 216.) IV.] MALANGA (MdAoyya, Ptol. vii. 1. § 92), thechief town of the Arvarni, a tribe who inhabited theeastern side of llindostan, below where the Tyndis(now Kisttia) flows into the sea. It has been sup­posed that it is the same place as the presentMadras, but it may liave been a little higher upnear XelUirt. [V.] MALAO (MoAda, Ptol. iv. 7. § 10. com. Mi-Atwt), probably answers to the modern Berbera, thechief town of the Somiileh, who inhabit the westerncoast of Africa from the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb tocape Guardafui. This district has in all times beenthe seat of an active commerce between Africa andArabia, and Malao was one of the principal martslor gums, myrrh, frankincense, cattle, slaves, gold- dust and ivory. (See Heeren, African Xatimt,vol. i. p. 330, Engl. transL) [W. B I>] MALATA. according to an inscription, or Miutaaccording to the Peuting. Table, a place in Pannxu*Inferior, on the Danube. As the inscriptioo vraefound at Peterxcardein, MaUla was perhaps sita-ated at or near the latter place. (Gear. Rsv. ir.19; Marsilius, Danub. ii. p. 118, tab. 47.) [L.S.] MALCHUBII. [Mauketasul] MALCOAE. [Mandicls.] MA'LEA (MoA«'a), a town in the district ofAegytis in Arcadia, the inhabitants of which wowtransferred to Megalopolis upon the foundation ofthe latter city. (Paus, viii. 27. § 4.) Its territorywas called the Maleatis (^ MaAfaru). Xen .ph.*idescribes Lcuctra as a fortress situated above tb*Maleatis; and as Leuctra was probably at or DearLeotvldri, Malea must have been in the same Dcirb-bourhood. [Leuctka.] Leake, however, connertifur,Malea with the river Mali's (MoAoor, Paus. vm.35. § 1), a tributary of the Aipheius, places the)town on this river, and on the mad from MeesJo-polis to Carnasium (Leake, Peloponnesiaca, p.24S);but this is not probable. The place Midea (MaSca)mentioned by Xenophon (Hell. vii. 1. § 28) is pro­bably a corrupt form of Malea. (Curtius, Ptlopon-nesos, vol. i. p. 336.) MA'LEA (MoAe'a, Steph. B.«.r. etalii; MoAmi,Herod, i. 82; Strab. viii. p. 368), still called MaJia,a promontory of Laconia, and the most southerlypoint in Greece with the exception of Taenarum.For details see Vol. II. p. 114.> MA'LEA (MoAto, Thucyd. in. 4,6; Xeo. Hett. L6. §§ 2C, 27; MoAia, Strab. xiii. p. 617; Maria,Ptol. v. 2; 6ee Schol. ad A ristoph. Ilan. p. 33), thesouthernmost point of the island of Lksiuw*, reck­oned by Strabo to be 70 stadia distant from Myti-lene, 560 stadia from Cape Sigrium, and 340 fromMethymna. Immediately opposite, on the mainland,were the point of Cake and the islands of Aluai*Ki'SAE [seo those articles]. The modern nan* ofMalea is Ztitoun Bourowi, or Cape Sl Mary, andit is a high and conspicuous point at sea. Xeno­phon says (/. c.) that the fleet of Callicratida* oc­cupied this station before the sea-fi^ht off Areinu>ae.There is some obscurity in Xenophon's topography inreference to this place; and the Malea of Thacr-dides (I. c.) can hardly have been C. SL Maty,unless there is some error in his relation, lie aa»»distinctly (c. 4.), that Malea lay to the north JMytilene, and (c 6.) that the Athenians hadtheir market there, while Ik-sieging the city. Tb*first statement is inconsistent with the position ofCape St. Maty, and the second with ita distancefrom Mytilene. Possibly the Malea of Thoerdnle*had some connection with the sanctuary of ApulloMalocis. (See the notes of Arnold and Poppa, andThirlwall's Greece, vol. iii. p. 173.) [J. S. H.] MA'LEA (MoAm, or MoAoia toot, PtoL viL 4.§ 8), a large group of mountains in the southernpart of the ancient Taprobane or CeyUm. Therecan be little doubt that it comprehends the mountaintract now known by the name of Xetcrra Elba, oneof the chief mountains of which is called, from theArabs, Adam's Peak, by the natives Sripada. Pto­lemy states, that it is the water-abed of three riim,which he calls the Soanas, the Asanas, and theBaraces, and describes with remarkable truth thepresent condition of the island, when he adds thatin the low ground below it, towards the sea, are thepastures of the elephants. Pliny speaks of a moon­

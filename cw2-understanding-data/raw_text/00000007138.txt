This implies that there were a;least three approaches from the forum to the Mons Capitolinus. Cf.Die. Antiq., Capitolium. 11. L,ucum asyli. The Asylum opened by Romulus for the in­discriminate reception of foreigners, as described by Livy (1, 8) andDion. Hal. {2, 15), was situated between two groves. Only one re­mained in the age of T., here called lucum asyli, which was situatedbetween the two summits of the Capitoline Hill. Cf. note, 69 : arcemCapitolii.—Tarpeia rupes. The whole Capitoline Hill was originallycalled Mons Tarpeius, from the virgin Tarpeia, who was killed andburied there by the Sabines. Liv. 1,11. But the name Tarpeia wasafterwards confined to the rock which was the immediate scene ofher destruction, and whence criminals were thrown headlong into theTiber. Cf. Die. Antiq. as above. 16. Q,uac crebrior fama. Al. fama est. Pliny (N. H. 34, 7)and Josephus (B. J. 4, 11)- charge the conflagration to the Vitellians.But they lived in the reign of Vespasian, Tacitus under Trajan, quumveritati, non adulationi locus esset. Brotier. 1T. Nitentes .... depulerint. Al. quo ... depellerent. Butthe reading of the text, though less obvious, gives the same sense, andrests on better authority. 18. Porticus .... aedibus, i. e. to the temple of Jupiter Capi­tolinus, which had a triple row of l )Iumns in front, and a double rowon each side (Dionys. 4, 61), and which T. calls aedibus, perhaps be­cause it contained within one enclosure and beneath one roof, threeaed.es, sacred severally to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Brotier. Cf.Die. Antiq. as above.—Sustinentes .... aquilae. The ornamentsand supports of the pediment (vulgarly called the gable-end). Thesewere usually in public edifices wrought into the form of eagles withoutstretched wings. Cf. Rup. ad loc. 20. Indireptum. Josephus (B. J. 4, 11, 4) says that the Vitel­lians plundered the temple. Ch. LXXII.—85. Pignus imperil = ut pignus imperii esset.Rup. (X Gr. 204, R. 1. 26. Porsena. Al. Porsenna. The penult, is short in Mart. 1,22;Hor. Epod. 16, 4 ; Sil. Ital. 8, 391, et al.; but long in Virg. Aen. 8,646. The best authorities are at variance touching the orthographyand the prosody of the word. Cf. Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome—Dedita urbe. T. is charged by many with error here, or at leastwith speaking rhetorically, rather than what was historically true. ButNiebuhr and Arnold argue with great force from the circumstancesand results of the war with Porsena, that the common history is falsi,fied by Roman pride, and that T. has preserved the only true account,and Rome was really surrendered to the Etruscans.

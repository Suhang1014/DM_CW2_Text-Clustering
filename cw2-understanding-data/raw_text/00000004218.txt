OCR Output B. II.] AGAINST APION. 455 enemies to injustice: they take care of righteousness : theybanish idleness and expensive living, and instruct men to becontent with what they have, and to be laborious in theircallings: they forbid men to make war from a desire ofgetting more, but make men courageous in defending thelaws: they are inexorable in punishing malefactors: theyadmit no sophistry of words, but are always established byactions themselves, which actions we ever propose as surerdemonstrations than what is contained in writing only; onwhich account I am so bold as to say, that we are becomethe teachers of other men in the greatest number of things,and those of the most excellent nature only: for what is moreexcellent than inviolable piety ? what is more just than subÂ­mission to laws ? and what is more advantageous than mutuallove and concord ? And this so far, that we are neither tobe divided by calamities, nor to become injurious and seditious -in prosperity; but to contemn death when we are in war, andin peace to apply ourselves to our mechanical occupations,or to our tillage of the ground; while we in all things andalways are satisfied that God is the inspector and governorof our actions. If these precepts had either been written atfirst, or more exactly kept by any others before us, we shouldhave owed them thanks as disciples owe to their masters:but if it be visible that we have made use of them more thanany other men, and if we have demonstrated that the originalinvention of them is our own let the Apions, and the Molons,with all the rest of those that delight in lies and reproaches,stand confuted; but let this and the foregoing book bodedicated to thee, Epaphroditus, who art so great a lover oftruth, and by thy means to those that have been in likemanner desirous to be acquainted with the affairs of ournation.

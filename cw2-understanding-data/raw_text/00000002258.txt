L. 25S his throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome.The genius of the Arabian prophet, the manners of hisnation, and the spirit of his religion, involve the causesof the decline and fall of the eastern empire; and oureyes are curiously intent on one of the most memorablerevolutions which have impressed a new and lastingcharacter on the nations of the globe.3 In the vacant space between Persia, Syria,tim of Egypt, and Ethiopia, the Arabian peninsula11may be conceived as a triangle of spacious butirregular dimensions. From the northern point of Bel«acon the Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles isterminated by the straits of Babelmandel and the landof frankincense.

The Grecla andlatins, whose progressive know ledge may be traced in Agatharcides,(de Mari Rubro,in Hudson, Oeograph. Minor, torn. 1.) Diodorus Siculus, (torn. 1. lib. 3. p. 159—•167. lib. 3. p. 311—*16. edit.

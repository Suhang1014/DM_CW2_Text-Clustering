They deserved his confidenceby the valour and military skill which they exerted.They wisely began the action upon the left; andadvancing their whole wing of cavalry in an obliqueline, they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank ofthe enemy, which was unprepared to resist the im­petuosity of their charge. But the Romans of theWest soon rallied, by the habits of discipline; andthe Barbarians of Germany supported the renown oftheir national bravery. The engagement soon be­came general; was maintained with various 'andsingular turns of fortune, and scarcely ended withthe darkness of the night. The signal victory whichConstantius obtained is attributed to the arms ofhis cavalry. His cuirassiers are described as somany massy statues of steel, glittering with theirscaly armour, and breaking with their ponderouslances the firm array of the Gallic legions. Assoon as the legions gave way, the lighter and moreactive squadrons of the second line rode swordin hand into the intervals, and completed the dis­order. In the mean while, the huge bodies of theGermans were exposed almost naked to the dex­terity of the oriental archers; and whole troops ofthose Barbarians were urged by anguish and despairto precipitate themselves into the broad and rapidstream of the Drave. The number of the slain wascomputed at fifty-four thousand men, andthe slaughterof the conquerors was more considerable than that ofthe vanquished; a circumstance which proves the ob­stinacy of the contest, and justifies the observationof an ancient writer, that the forces of the empirewere consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa, by the Sulpicius Severus, 1 . ii. p. 405.

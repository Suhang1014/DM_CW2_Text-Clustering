Its distance from the sea was120 stadia, but communication with the sea waseffected by the navigable river CaTcus. Pergammn,which is first mentioned by Xenophon (Auub. vii. 8.§ 8), was originally a fortress of considerable naturalstrength, being situated on the summit of a conicalhill, round the foot of which there were at that timeno bouses. Subsequently, however, a city arose atthe foot of the hill, and the latter then became theacropolis. We have no information as to the founda­tion of the original town on the hill, but the Per-gamenians believed themselves to be the descendantsof Arcadians, who had migrated to Asia under theleadership of the Heracleid Telephus (Paus. i. 4.§ 5); they derived the name of their t<iwn fromPergamus, a son of Pyrrhus, who was believed tohave arrived there with his mother Andromache,and, after a successful combat with Alius, the rulerof Teuthrania, to have established himself there.(Paus. i. 11. §2.) Another tradition stated thatAsclepius, with a colony from Epidaurus, proceededto Pergamum; at all events, the place seems to havebeen inhabited by many Greeks at the time whenXenophon visited it. Slill, however, Pergamumremained a place of not much importance until thetime of Lysimachus, one of the generals of Alexanderthe Great. This Lysimachus chose Pergamum asa place of security for the reception and preserva­tion of his treasures, which amounted to 9000talents. The care and superintendence of this trea­sure was intrusted to Philetaerus of Tium, an eunuchfrom his infancy, and a person in whom Lysimachusplaced the greatest confidence. For a time Phile­taerus answered the expectations of Lysimachus, buthaving been ill-treated by Arsinoe, the wife of hismaster, ho withdrew his allegiance and declaredhimself independent, B. c. 283. As Lysimachuswas prevented by domestic calamities from punishingthe offender, Philetaerus remained in undisturbedpossession of the town and treasures for twenty years,contriving by dexterous management to maintainpeace with his neighbours. He transmitted hisprincipality to a nephew of the name of Eumenes,who increased the territory he had inherited, andeven gained a victory over Antiochus, the son ofSelcucus, iu the neighbourhood of Sardes. After areign of twenty-two years, from R. c. 263 to 241, hewas succeeded by his cousin Attains, who, after agreat victory over the Galatians, assumed the titleof king, and distinguished himself by his talents andsound policy. (Strab. xiii. pp. 623, 624; Polyb.xviii. 24; Liv. xxxiii. 21.) He espoused the in­terests of Rome against Philip of Macedonia, and inconjunction with the Rhodiau fleet rendered im­portant services to the Romans. It was mainiy thisAttains that amassed the wealth for which his namebecame proverbial. He died at an advanced age, iuB.c. 197, and was succeeded by his son Knmenes 11.,from B. c. 197 to 159. He continued his friend­ship with the Romans, and assisted them againstAntiochus the Great and Perseus of Macedonia; afterthe defeat of Antiochus, the Romans rewarded hisservices by giving to him all the countries in AsiaMinor west of Mount Taurus. Pergamum, the ter­ritory of which had hitherto not extended beyondthe gulfs of Elaea and Adramyttium, now became alarge and powerful kingdom. (Strub. I. o.; Liv.xxxviii. 39.)

OCR Output JOSEPHUS'S DISCOURSE ABOUT HADES. 459 committed all judgment; and he in order to fulfil the willof his Father shall come as judge, whom we call Christ. ForMinos and Rhadamanthus are not the judges, as you Greeksdo suppose, but he whom God and the Father hath glorified ; CONCERNING WHOM WE IIAVE ELSEWHERE GIVEN A MORE PAR­TICULAR ACCOUNT, FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE WHO SEEK AFTER truth.

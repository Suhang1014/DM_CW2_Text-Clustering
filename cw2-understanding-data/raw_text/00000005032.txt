OCR Output NOTES ON THE THIRD CHAPTER, umbra*, is the indignant expression of Locan, butit is a patriotic, rather than a devout indignation. [25] Dion Cassias, 1. liii. p. 710, with the cu­rious annotations of Reymar. [26] As Octavianus advanced to the banquet ofthe Cæsars, his colour changed like that of thecamelion; pale at first, then red, afterwards black,he at last assumed the mild livery of Venus andthe Graces (Cæsares, p. 309). This image employedby Julian, in his ingenious fiction, is just and ele­gant: but when he .considers this change of cha­racter as real, and ascribes it to the power of phi­losophy; he does too much honour to philosophy,and to Octavianus. [27] Two centuries after the establishment ofmonarchy, the emperor Marcus Antoninns recom­mends the character of Brutus as a perfect model ofRoman virtue. [28] It is much to be regretted, that we havelost the part of Tacitus, which treated of that trans­action. We are forced to content ourselves withthe popular rumours of Josephus, and the imperfecthints of Dion and Suetonius. [29] Augustus restored the ancient severity ofdiscipline. After the civil wars, he dropped theendearing name of Fellow-Soldiers, and called themonly Soldiers (Sueton. in August c. 2;.). See theuse Tiberius made of the senate in the mutiny ofthe Pannonian legions (Tacit Annal. i.). [30] These words seem to have been the constitu­tional language. See Tacit. Annal. xiii. 4. [31] The first was Camillus Scribonianus, whotook up arms in Dalmatia against Claudius, andwas deserted by his own troops in five days. Thesecond, L. Antonius, in Germany, who rebelledagainst Domitian; and the third, Avidius Cassius,in the reign of M. Antoninus. The two lastreigned but a few months, and were cut off by theirown adherents. We may observe, that both Ca­millus and Cassius coloured their ambition withthe design of restoring the republic; a task, saidCassius, peculiarly reserved for his name and fa­mily.

See Hist. i. 5. 16. ii. 76. [35] The emperor Vespasian, with his usual goodsense, laughed at the Genealogists, who deduced hisfamily from Flavius, the founder of Reate (his na­tive country), and one of the companions of Her-,cules. Sueton. in Vespasian, i. 12. [36] Dio, 1. lxviii. p. 1121. Plin. Secund. inPanegyric. [37] Felicior Augusto, melior Trajano. Eu-trop. viii. 5. [383 Dio (1. Ixix. p. 1249.) affirms the wholeto have been a fiction, on the authority of his fa­ther, who being governor of the province whereTrajan died, had very good opportunities of siftingthis mysterious transaction. Yet Dodwell (Prælect.Camden. xvii.) has maintained, that Hadrian wascalled to the certain hope of the empire, during thelife-time of Trajan. [39] Dio (1. Ixx. p. 1171.). Aurel. Victor. [40] The deification of Antinous, his medals,statues, temples, city, oracles, and constellation,are well known, and still dishonour the memory ofHadrian. Yet we may remark, that of the firstfifteen emperors, Claudius was the only one whosetaste in love was entirely correct.

[42] Without the help of medals and inscrip­tions, we should be ignorant of this fact, so ho­nourable to the memory of Pins. [43] During the twenty-th'ree years of Pius'sreign, Marcus was only two nights absent from thepalace, and even those were at different times. Hist.August, p. 25. [44] He was fond of the theatre and not insen­sible to the charms of the fail sex. Marcus Anto­ ninus,

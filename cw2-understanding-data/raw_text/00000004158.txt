Now, I have lately shown, that these Egyptians had Abra­ham in great veneration, and that all the wisdom of thoseEgyptians, in which Moses was afterwards learned, was de­rived from no other than from Abraham. Now it appearsevidently, by the forecited passage, that the first abolitionof these human sacrifices, and the substitution of waxenimages in their stead, and particularly at Heliopolis, in thenorth-east part of Egypt, in the neighborhood of Beersheba,in the south of Palestine, where Abraham now lived, at thedistance of about one hundred and twenty miles only, wasin the days, and by the order of Tethmosis or Amosis, whowas the first of the Egyptian kings, after the expulsion ofthe Phoenician shepherds. Now, therefore, we are to inquirewhen this Tethmosis or Amosis lived, and compare his timewith the time of the sacrifice of Isaac. Now, if we look intomy chronological table, published A. D. 1721, we shall findthat the hundred and twenty-fifth year of Abraham, or whichis all one, the twenty-fifth year of Isaac, falls into A. M.2573, or into the thirteenth year of Tethmosis or Amosis,which is the very middle of his twenty-five years' reign; sothat this abolition of human sacrifices in Egypt, and substi­tution of others in their room, seems to have been occasionedby the solemn prohibition of such a sacrifice in the case ofAbraham, and by the following substitution of a ram in itsstead : which account of this matter not only takes away thegroundless suspicions of the moderns, but shows the greatseasonableness of the divine prohibition of the execution ofthis command to Abraham, as probably the direct occasionof putting a stop to the barbarity of the Egyptians in offer­ing human sacrifices, and that for many, if not for all gene­rations afterward.

ThusJoannes Lydus: «al roiotnov xvtqv &yaApa(TtTpd~fiopfpov) if T(p <p6p(f> rovNfp€a trl teal vvv Acyerat<jt<jtoO}itvov (tie Malt. iv. 1). So also Martial; — u Nunc tua Caesarcis cinguntur Umina donisEt for* tot nomeros, Jane, quot on gens"(x. 28. 5). In the middle ages this Janus-temple appear! tohave borne the name of jVooA'j Ark. In the time of Pope Paul V. considerable remainsexisted of the pronaos, or vestibule of this temple ofMinerva, consisting of several columns with theirentablature, with the following inscription: DIP.NERVA. CAKSAU. AVO. PONT, MAX. TRIB. POT.it. imp. n. PROCOS. (Canina, Fwro Horn. p. 171.)Paul took these columns to adorn his fountain, theAcqua Paolo, on the Janieulum. In the ViaAhsmndrina there are still remains of the wall ofpeperino which formed the enclosure of the forum,together with two large Corinthian columns halfburied in the earth, now called the Colonnacce.Their entablature is covered with mutilated reliefs,and over them is an Attic, with a figure of Minerva,also in relief. The situation of the forum of Nerra,and the remains of it existing in his time, are de­creed by Palladio (AvchiMtura, lib. iv.), also byDu Perac (torn, vi.), who observes, that it was thenthe most complete ruin of a forum in Koine. TheCohmtacce are represented by Gamucci, Antichitatli Roma, p. 55; Desgodetz, p. 159, seq.; Overbeke,pi. 39. There is a good description of the f»ra ofAugustus and Nerra by Niebuhr in the BeschrdbunyHorns, vol. iii. p. 275. Forum Trajani. Thus between the Capitolineand Palatine hills, the Velian ridge and the ascentof the Quirinal, the valley was almost filled with asplendid series of public places, which we mightimagine could hardly be surpassed. Yet it was re­served for Trajan to complete another forum, stillmore magnificent than any of the preceding ones,for the construction of which the Quirinal itself wasforced to yield up part of its mass. Previouslyto the time of Trajan that hill was connectedwith the Capitoline by a sort of isthmus, or slen­der neck; the narrow and uneven defile betweenthem was covered with private houses, nnd tra­versed only by a single road of communicationbetween the forum and Campus Martina. Buton the western side of this defile lay one of thehandsomest quarters of Rome, containing the SeptaJulia, the Flaminian circus, the theatres of Balboa,Poinpey, and Marcellus, together with those templesand porticoes which so much excited the admirationof Strabo, ami which he has described in a passagequoted in the former part of this article. The de­sign of the forum of Trajan was, therefore, to con­nect this quarter of the town with the imperial forain a manner not unworthy of the magnificent struc­tures on cither side of it. Tins gigantic work, aportion of which still remains, though the greaterpart lias disappeared under the united influences oftime and barbarism, is (apposed to have been pro­jected, and even begun, by DomitUu. (Aur. Vict.Ctu-K. 13; Uieron. i. p. 443, lionc; Cassiod. Chron.it. p. 197.) It was, however, executed by Trajan,with the assistance of the celebrated architect Apollo-dorus of Damascus. (Dion Cass. Ixix. 4.)

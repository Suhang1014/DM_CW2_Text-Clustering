And he promised to publish a magni­ficent decree, about what they requested, which should confirmwhat Aristeus had proposed, and especially what God willedshould be done; whereby he said, he would not only set thosefree who had been led away captive by his father, and his army,but those who were in this kingdom before, and those also, ifany such there were, who had been brought away since. Andwhen they said that their redemption money would amount toabove four hundred talents, he granted it. A copy of whichdecree I have determined to preserve, that the magnanimity ofthis king may be made known.

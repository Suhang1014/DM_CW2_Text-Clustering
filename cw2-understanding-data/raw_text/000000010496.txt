Being a man of enterpriseand bold ambition, he induced the soldiers to swearfidelity to himself, and went into open rebellion. Hisletters to the emperor Claudius were written in a toneof menace, requiring him to abdicate, and live a pri­vate citizen. In the mean time, the rebel legions,with the versatility common to the military mind, re­turned to their duty; Scribonianus fled to a small islandof the Adriatic, on the coast of Illyricum, and therewas. seized and put to death by Volaginius, a commonsoldier, on the fifth day of his revolt.

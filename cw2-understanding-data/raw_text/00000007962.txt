Afar. Erythr. c. 27,36; Marcian, PeripL c. 28, ed. Muller, 1855), aport of some importance on the coast of Carmania,which is noticed also by Pliny (vi. 28. s. 32). Itsposition was near the modern bay of Tshubar, per­haps where Mannert has suggested, at Cape Tanka(v. 2. p. 421). Vincent places it a little to the E.of Cape lask. In Ptolemy, the name has been cor­rupted into Commana (vi. 8. § 7). [V.] OMANA (to; "O/iafa), a deep bay on the southcoast of Arabia east of Syagree, 600 stadia in dia­meter, according to the Periplus, bounded on thecast by lofty and rugged mountains (ap. Hudson,Geoff. Min. torn. i. p. 18), doubtless identical withthe Omanum emporium, which Ptolemy places inlong. 77° 40', lat. 19° 45', which must have belongedto the Omanitae mentioned by the same geographer(vi. 15), separated only by the Cattabani from theabates Asaborum, doubtless the mountains men­tioned in the Periplus. If Pas Fartak be cor­rectly taken as the ancient Syagros, the ancientOmana must have been fur to the west of the dis­trict of Arabia now called by that name, andwithin the territory of lladramaut. The modern'Oman is the south-eastern extremity of the penin­sula, and gives its name to the sea outside themouth of the Persian Gvlf, which washes it on theeast and south.

Tacitus (Germ. 43) inenumerating the tribes of the Lygii does not mentionthe Omani, but a tribe occurs in his list bearing thename of Manimi, which from its resemblance is ge­nerally regarded as identical with tho Omani. Butnothing certain can be said [L. S.] OMBI ("OuSoi, Ptol. nr. 5. § 73; Steph. B.». v.; It. Anton, p. 165; Ombos, Juv. xv. 35;Ambo, jVof. Imp. sect. 20: Eth. 'Op.6lrr]s; comp.Aelian, Hist.

Ombi was a gar­rison town under every dynasty of Aegypt, Pharaonic,Macedonian, and ltoman; and was celebrated for themagnificence of its temples and its hereditary feudwith the people of Tentyra. Ombi was the first ciiy below Syene at whichany remarkable remains of antiquity occur. TheNile, indeed, at this portion of its course, is ill-suitedto a dense population. It runs between steep andnarrow banks of sandstone, and deposits but littleof its fertilising slime upon the drear)- and barrenshores. There are two temples at Ombi, constructedof the stone obtained from the neighbouring quarries, 1 I

The conjecture of Vincent ( Voy­age of Xearchut, i. p. 362) that it is representedby the present Kat-al-Ojerd appears well founded.It is perhaps the same as the Themisteas Promon-torium of Pliny (vi. 25) as suggested by Miiller(Geoy.

(Strab. xiii. p.p. 587.) Strabo indeed states that the river flowedin numerous windings not far from Zeleia; but hecan scarcely mean any other river than the one nowbearing the name HaKkeiri, and which the Turksstill call Tana. Hamilton (Ketearchet, vol. ii. p,106) identifies it with the Kara So or Kara DenSu, which flows into SAike Maniyas. [L. S.] TARSU'RAS (Tapoovpar, Arrian, Per. P.

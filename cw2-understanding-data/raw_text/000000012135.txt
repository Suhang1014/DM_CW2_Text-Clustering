To the north of, and beyond,the city proper, the pretty considerable space of the modernEl Mersa, even at that time occupied in great part by villasand well-watered gardens, and then called Magalia, hada circumvallation of its own dovetailed into the city wall.On the opposite point of the peninsula, the Jebel-Khawinear the modern village of Ghamart, lay the necropolis.These three—the old city, the suburb, and the necropolis—together filled the whole breadth of the promontory on itsside next the gulf, and were only accessible by the two high­ways leading to Utica and Tunes along that narrow tongueof land, which, although not closed by a wall, yet afforded amost advantageous position for the armies taking their standunder the protection of the capital with the view of protect­ing it in return. The difficult task of reducing so well fortified a city wasrendered still more difficult by the fact, that the resources ofthe capital itself and of its territory which still included800 townships and was mostly under the power of the emi­grant party on the one hand, and the numerous tribes of thefree or half-free Libyans hostile to Massinissa on the other,enabled the Carthaginians simultaneously with their defenceof the city to keep a numerous army in the field—an armywhich, from the desperate temper of the emigrants and theserviceableness of the light Numidian cavalry, the besiegerscould not afford to disregard.The siege.

Censorinus fitted up two largebattering-rams on the tongue, and made a breach with themat this, the weakest place of the wall; but, as evening had setin, the assault had to be postponed. During the night thebesieged succeeded in filling up a great part of the breach,and in so damaging the Roman machines by a sortie that

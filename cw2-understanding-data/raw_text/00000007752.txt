Before the close of the Lom­bard period we find that it was already designatedby the name of Papia, from which its modern appel­lation of Pavia is derived. Paulus Diaconus calls it"Ticinus quae alio nomine Papia appeJlatur" (P.Diac ii. 15); and the anonymous Geographer ofRavenna gives the same double appellation (Geogr.Ravenn. iv. 30). The most probable explanation ofthis change of name is that when Ticinum becameadmitted to the rights of a Roman municipium itsinhabitants were enrolled in the Papian tribe, a factwhich we learn from inscriptions (Gruter, Inscr.p. 1093. 7; Murat. Inscr. p. 1087. 1, p. 1119. 4),and that in consequence of this the city came to beknown as"Civitaa Papia," in contradistinction toMediolanum, which belonged to the Ufentine tribe.(Aldini, Anttche Lapidi Ticinest, pp.43—60.) The modern city of Pavia contains no remains ofantiquity except a few sarcophagi and inscriptions.These confirm the municipal condition of the cityunder the Roman Empire, but are not in themselvesof much interest. [E. II. B.] TICINUS (TiKtvos: Ticiuo), a considerable riverof Northern Italy, and one of the most importantof the northern tributaries of the Pad us. It has itssources among the high Alps, in the Mons Adula orMont St. Gethardj and, where it first emerges fromthe Alpine valleys forms an extensive lake, calledthe Lacus Vkkbakus or Logo Maggtore. Whereit issues from this again it is a deep, clear, andrapid stream, and flows through the level plains ofLombardy, with a course of above 60 miles, passingunder the walls of Ticinum (Pavia), and dischargingits waters into the Padus or Po, about 3 miles belowthat city. (Strab. iv. p. 209, v. p. 217; Plin. ii.103. s. 106, iii. 19. s. 23.) Throughout thislower part of its course (from the Logo Maggtoreto the Po) it is navigable for vessels ot considerableburden; but the extreme rapidity of the currentrenders the navigation inconvenient if not dangerous,lis banks are low and marshy, the river beingbordered on each side by a belt of thickets andmarshy woods. This character of its banks isnoticed by Chuulian (de VI. Com. lion. 194), whileSiiius Italicns alludes to the beautiful clearness ofits waters. (Sil. Ital. iv. 82.) The Ticinus appears to have been recognised atan early period as the boundary between the Insubriansand their neighl»ours the Libieii and Laevi (Liv. v.34, 35). From its geographical position it mustalways have presented a formidable barrier to anyinvader advancing into Italy after having crossed theCottian, Graian or Pennine Alps, and for this reasonits banks have been the scene of many successivebattles. Even in the first descent of the Gauls intothe plains of Northern Italy, we are told that theydefeated tho Etruscans in a battle near the riverTicinus (Liv. v. 34). But much the most celebratedof the contests which were fought on its banks wasthat between Hannibal and P. Scipio in B.C. 218,shortly after the descent of the Carthaginian generalinto Italy. 'Die precise scene of this action cannot,however, be determined; but it appears to have beenfought on the W. or right bank of the Ticinus, at ashort distance from the Padus, and probably not farfrom the site of Ticinum or Pavia, Livy marks itmore distinctly as being within 5 miles of a placecalled Victumvii ( ?); but as no other mention of thisobscure name occurs, this lends us no assistance. (Liv. xxi. 45.) The narrative of PtJ)Ui» ■ -afrom clear and has given rbe to cony-jem* :ara-sion.

Ar--this, Polybius tells us, " both peneraUadviMCi-.the river, on the side facing the Alps,:« tat-having the stream on their left hand, u>C*rj*ginians on their right" (iii. 65).

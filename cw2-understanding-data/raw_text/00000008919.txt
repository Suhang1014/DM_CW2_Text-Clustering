Strabo derives its name fromthe circumstance that it was here that the Trojanwomen who were conducted as captives by a Greekfleet, set fire to the ships of the victors, and thuscompelled them to settle in this part of Italy. (Strab.vi. p. 262; Flin. iii. 11. s. 15.) It is well known thatthe same legend is transferred by other writers tomany different localities, and appears to have beenone of those which gradually travelled along thecoast of Italy, in the same manner as the mythsrelating to Aeneas. The form of the name Nowutotemployed by Lycophron (AUx. 921) points evi­dently to the same fanciful derivation (from vavsand atdta). Theocritus alludes to the rich and va­ried herbage which grew on its banks (Id. iv. 24),and for which, according to a modem traveller, itis still remarkable. (Swinburne, Travels, vol. i. p.313.) [E. H. 15.] NEANDREIA, KEA'NDRIUM, NKANDRUS(NfdvSpeia, NtavSpiuv. NiavZpos: Eih. NtavSptvtor NeavSoievs), a town in Troas, probably founded hyAeolians; in the time of Strabo it had disappeared,its inhabitants, together with those of other neigh­bouring places, having removed to Alexandreia.(Strab. xiii. pp. 604, 606.) According to Scylax(p. 36) and Stephanus Byz. (>. r.), Neandreia wasa maritime town on the Hellespont ; and Strabomight perhaps be supposed to be mistaken inplacing it in the interior above Hamaxitus ; but heis so explicit in his description, marking its dis­tance from New Ilium at 130 stadia, that it isscarcely possible to conceive him to be in the wrong.Hence Leake (.Isia Minor, p. 274), adopting himas his guide, seeks the site of Neandreia in thelower valley of the Scaiuander, near the modem townof Ene.

B.; but coins bare N<o*oAfrn>, Neapo­litans: Jfapoli; in French and English Naples),one of the most considerable cities of Campania,situated on the northern shore of the gulf called theCrater or Sinus Cumanus, which now derives fromit the name of Bay of Naples. All ancient writersagree in representing it as a Greek city, and acolony of the neighbouring Cumac; but the circum­stances of its foundation are very obscurely related.Scymnus Chius tells us it was founded in pursuanceof an oracle; and Strabo calls it a Cumaean colony,but adds that it subsequently received an additionalbody of Chalcidic and Athenian colonists, with someof the settlers from the neighbouring islands of thePithecusae, and was on this account called Neapolis,or the New City. (Strab. v. p. 246; Srymn. Ch. 253;Veil Pat. i. 4.) Its Chalcidic or Euboean origin isrepeatedly alluded to by Statius, who was himself anative of the city (Silt. i. 2.263, ii. 2. 94, iii. 5.12);but these expressions probably refer to its being aI colony from the Chalcidic city of Cumae. The nameI itself sufficiently points to the fact that it was D I> 4

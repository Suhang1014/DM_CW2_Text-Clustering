It is first men­tioned in the Persian wars, when two hundred of itscitizens fought at the battle of Plataea, alongside ofthe Leucadians and Anactorians. (Herod, ix. 28.)It also sent four ships to the assistance of theCorinthians against the Corey wans just before thecommencement of the Peloponnesian War (Time. L27); from which circumstance, together with itsfighting alcng with the Corinthian Leucadiuns andAnactorians at the battle of Plataea, it hits U-t-nconjectured that Pale was a Corinthian colony.But whether this was the case or not, it joined theAthenian alliance, together with the other towns ofthe island, in B.C. 431. (Time. ii. 30.) At a laterperiod Pale espoused the side of the Aetolians againstthe Achaeans, and was accordingly besieged byPhilip, who would have taken the city but for thetreachery of one of his own officers. (Pol. v. 3, 4.)Poly hi us describes Pale as surrounded by the t-ea,and by precipitous heights on every side, except theone looking towards Zacyntbus. He further statesthat it possessed a fertile territory, in which a con­siderable quantity of corn was grown. Pale sur­rendered to the Romans without resistance in B. c.189 (Liv. xxxviii. 28); and after the capture ofSame by the Romans in that year, it became thechief town in the island.

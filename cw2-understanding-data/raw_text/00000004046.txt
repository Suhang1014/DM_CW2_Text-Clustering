And do the Romanscommit such wickedness, as did the king of Assyria, that youmay have reason to hope for the like vengeance upon them 1Did not that king accept of money from our king on this con­dition, that he should not destroy the city ? and yet contraryto the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple ;while the Romans do demand no more than that accustomedtribute which our fathers paid to their fathers ; and if theymay but once obtain that, they neither aim to destroy thiscity nor to touch this sanctuary; nay, they will grant youbesides, that your posterity shall be free, and your possessionssecured to you, and will preserve your holy laws inviolate toyou. And it is plain madness to expect that God shouldappear as well disposed towards the wicked as towards therighteous, since he knows when it is proper to punish menfor their sins immediately ; accordingly, he brake the powerof the Assyrians the very first night that they pitched theircamp. Wherefore, had he judged that our nation wasworthy of freedom, or the Romans of punishment, he hadimmediately inflicted punishment upon those Romans, as hedid upon the Assyrians, when Pompey began to meddle withour nation, or when, after him, Sosius came up against us, orwhen Vespasian laid waste Galilee, or, lastly, when Tituscame first of all near to this city ; although Magnus andSosius did not only suffer nothing, but took the city by force ;as did Vespasian go from the war he had made against youto receive the empire; and as for Titus, those springs thatwere formerly almost dried up' when they were under yourpower, since he has come, run more plentifully than theydid before: accordingly, you know that Siloam, as well as 1 This drying up of the Jerusalem fountain of Siloam, when the Jewswanted it, and its flowing abundantly when the enemies of the Jews wantedit, and these both in the days of Zedekiah and of Titus, (and this last as acertain event well known by the Jews at that time, as Josephus here tellsthem openly to their faces,) are very remarkable instances of a divine Provi­dence for the punishment of the Jewish nation when they were grown verywicked, at both those times of the destruction of Jerusnlem.

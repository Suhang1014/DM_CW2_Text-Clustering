[E. 11. 11.] MATINUS MONSu [Gargasus.] MATISCO, a place in Gallia Celtic*, in the ter­ritory of the Aedui in Caesar's time, and on theSadne. (H. 0. vii. HO.) After the capture ofAlesia, n.

Atigdo). Accordingto the Mine writer it had a town of the same nameat its nvrnth, which served as the port of Adria.(Strah. v. p. 241.) Ptolemy also mentions themouth of the river Matrinus next to that of theAtcrnus. from which it is distant about 0 miles(Ptol. iii. 1. § 20), but he is certainly in error inassigning it to the Marrueini.

The passis described in some detail by Ammiauus3 from whom it appears that the name was applied only to Ihigher part, or actual pass of the mountain: ithis is confirmed by t lie Jerusalem Itinenry, whgives the name of A1 pes Cottiae to the whole pfrom Ebrodunam (A'm6n/n) to Segusio, and cfines that of Matrona to the actual mountaintween Brigantia (Bruiricon) and Gesdao (Ctsam(Itin.

In the year 632, Syria was invaded by the Sara­cens, nominally under t lie command of Abu Obeidah,one of the " companions M ot" Mahomet, but reallylt'tl by C haled, ** the sword of God." The easyconquest of Bosra inspirited the Moslems to attackI>:iina,scus; but here the resistance was more deter­mine!, and, though invested in 633, the city wasnot captured till the following year. Heraclius hadbeen able to collect a large force, which, however,under the command of his general Werdan, waacompletely defeated at the battle of Aisnadin; andDamascna, after that decisive engagement, thoughit still held out for seventy days, was compelled toyield. Heliopolis and Eincsa speedily shared thefate of Uusra and Damascus. The last efforts ofI If radius in defence of Syria, though of extraor­dinary magiutode, were frustrated by the battle ofthe Vennuk. Jerusalem, Aleppo, and Damascussuccessively yielded to the Saracen arms, and Hc-raclios abandoned a province which he could nolonger hope to retain. Thus in six campaigns(633 — 639) Syria was entirely wrested from theRoman empire. (Gibbon, Decline ami Fall, ch.51 ; Marquardt, Ram. AllertJi. vol. iii.) [T. H.

It was 3 stadia in length, and only broadenough to allow an army to pass in columns.(Xenoph.

Syrosproduces pood wine, but is upon the whole not fer­tile, and does not deserve the praises bestowed uponit by Homer (/. c), who describes it as rich in pas­tures, cattle, wine, and wheat. It is usually statedupon the authority of Pliny (xxxiii. 12. s. 56) thatSyros produced Sil or yellow ochre; but in SilHg'sedition of Pliny, Scyros is substituted for Syros. Syros had two cities even in the time of Homer(OtL xv. 412), one on the eastern, and the other onthe western side of the island. The one on theeastern side, which was called Syros (I'M. iii. 15.§ 3d), stood on the same site as the modern capital of the island, w hich is now one of the mat fcities in Greece, containing 11.000 ioiubiU.it*,>the centre of a flourishing trade, la ethe numerous new building* almost til Una 'idancient city have disappeared; but there •m <siderable remains of it when TournefJt venal Iisland.

OCR Output HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK IX. 139 creed to Marcius. These, in the beginning, securedall the passes between the camps of the consul in sucha manner that no messenger, however expert, couldmake his way from one to the other; and each consulspent several days in absolute uncertainty, and inanxious suspense concerning the state of the other.Apprehensions for their safety spread even to Rome ;so that all the younger citizens were compelled to en­list, and two regular armies were raised to answer sud­den emergences. The conduct of the Herniciansduring the progress of the war afterwards showed no­thing suitable to the present alarm, or to the ancientrenown of that nation. Without ever making anyeffort worth mentioning, being beaten out of three dif­ferent camps within a few days, they stipulated for atruce of thirty days, during which they might send toRome, to the senate, on the terms of furnishing twomonths' pay, and corn, and a tunic to every soldier.The senate referred them back to Marcius, whom theyempowered to determine on the affair, and he acceptedtheir submission. Meanwhile, in Samnium, the otherconsul, though superior in strength, was very muchembarrassed by the nature of his situation : the enemyhad blocked up all the roads, and seized on the passa­ble defiles, so as to stop all supplies of provisions; norcould the consul, though he daily drew out his troopsand offered battle, allure them to an engagement. Itwas evident that neither could the Samnites support animmediate contest, nor the Romans a delay of action.The approach of Marcius, who, after he had subduedthe Hernicians, hastened to the succor of his colleague,put it 'out of the enemy's power any longer to avoidfighting: for they, who had not deemed themselves amatch in the field, even for one of the armies, conldsurely not suppose that if they should allow the twoconsular armies to unite, they could have any hoperemaining: they made an attack therefore on Marciusas he was approaching in the irregular order of march.The baggage was hastily thrown together in the centre,and the line formed as well as the time permitted.

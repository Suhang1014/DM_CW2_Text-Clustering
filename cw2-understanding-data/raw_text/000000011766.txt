[Book IV. historical composition was restricted—with the exception ofthe very respectable but purely individual writings of Cato,which at any rate did not reach beyond the rudiments ofresearch and narration—partly to nursery tales, partly tocollections of notices. The Greeks had certainly exhibitedhistorical research and had written history; but the ideas ofnation and state had been so completely lost amidst the dis­tracted times of the Diadochi, that none of the numeroushistorians succeeded in following the steps of the great Atticmasters in spirit and in truth, or in treating from a broadpoint of view the matter of world-wide interest in the his­tory of the times. Their histories were either purely outwardrecords, or they were pervaded by the verbiage and sophis­tries of Attic rhetoric and only too often by the venality andvulgarity, the sycophancy and the exasperation of the age.Among the Romans as among the Greeks nothing existedbut histories of cities or of tribes.

The legend, the anecdote, the mass ofworthless chronicle-notices are thrown aside; the descrip­tion of countries and peoples, the representation of politicaland mercantile relations—all the facts of such infinite im­portance which escape the annalist because they do notadmit of being nailed to a particular year—are put into pos­session of their long-suspended rights. In the procuring ofhistoric materials Polybius shows a caution and perseverancesuch as are not perhaps paralleled in antiquity; he avails him­self of documents, gives comprehensive attention to theliterature of different nations, makes the most extensive useof his favourable position for collecting the accounts of actorsand eye-witnesses, and, in fine, methodically travels over thewhole domain of the Mediterranean states aud part of the

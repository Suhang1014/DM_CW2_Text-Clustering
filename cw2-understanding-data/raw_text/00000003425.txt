Every bow was bent, every ja­velin was directed, against that fatal object, and thecommand was repeated and obeyed by thousands whowere ignorant of its real motive. The bolder Bar­barians advanced to the more honourable combat ofswords and spears; and the praise of an enemy hasgraced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, whomaintained his foremost station, till he was piercedwith thirteen wounds, perhaps by the hand of Beli­sarius himself. The Roman general was strong,active, and dexterous: on every side he dischargedhis weighty and mortal strokes: his faithful guardsimitated his valour, and defended his person; andthe Goths, after the loss of a thousand men, fled be­fore the arms of a hero. They were rashly pursuedto their camp; and the Romans, oppressed by mul­titudes, made a gradual, and at length a precipitateretreat to the gates of the city: the gates were shutagainst the fugitives; and the public terror was in­creased, by the report, that Belisarius was slain.His countenance was indeed disfigured by sweat,dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strengthwas almost exhausted; but his unconquerable spiritstill remained: he imparted that spirit to his de­sponding companions; and their last desperate chargewas felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new army,vigorous and entire, had been poured from the city.The Flaminian gate Was thrown open to a real tri­umph; but it was not before Belisarius had visitedevery post, and provided for the public safety, thathe could be persuaded by his wife and friends totaste the needful refreshments of food and sleep. Inthe more improved state of the art of war, a generalis seldom required or even permitted to display the Valour ofBelisarius.

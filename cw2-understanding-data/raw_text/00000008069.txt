It was verycelebrated among the Romans for a beautiful kind ofmarble furnished by the neighbouring quarries, aqdwhich was commonly called Synnadic marble,though it came properly from a place in the neigh­bourhood, Docimia, whence it was more correctlycalled Docimites lapis. This marble was of a lightcolour, interspersed with purple spots and veins.(Strab. I. c; Plin. xxxv. 1; Stat. Silc. i. 5. 36;Comp. Steph.

Its situation ex-en iscd so important an influence upon its historyand progress, that it will be desirable to describethis somewhat more fully before proceeding to thehistory of the city, reserving, at the same time, tliutopographical details for subsequent discussion. I. Situation. Syracuse was situated on a table-land or tabularhill, forming the prolongation of a ridge whichbranches off from the more elevated table-land of tliointerior, and projects quite down to the sea, betweenthe bay known as the Great Harbour of Syracuse,and the more extensive bay which stretches on theN. as far as the peninsula of Tiiafsi's or Magnisi.The broad end of the kind of promontory thusfunned, which abuts upon the sea for a distance »»fabout 2j miles, may be considered as the base of atriangular plateau which extends for above 4 mill*into the interior, having its apex formed by thepoint now called Monyilellisi, which was occupiedby the ancient fort of Eliiyalcs. This communi­cates, as already stated, by a narrow ridge with thetable-land of the interior, but is still a maikedpoint of separation, and was the highest point of

The latter expresses it in amore rhetorical manner. [87] Pontius, c. 19. M. de Tillemont (Memoires,tom. iv. part i. p. 450. note cc) is not pleasedwith so positive an exclusion of any former martyrsof the episcopal rank. [88] Whatever opinion we may entertain os thecharacter or principles of Thomas Becket, we mustacknowledge that he suffered death, with a con­stancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs. SeeLord Lyttehon's History of Henry II. vol. ii. p.59*, &c [So] See in particular the treatise of Cyprian deLapsis, p. 87—98. Edit. Fell. The learning ofDodwell (Dissertat. Cyprianic. xii. xiii.), and theingenuity of Middleton (Free Enquiry, p. 162, &c),have left scarcely any thing to add concerning themerit, the honours, and the motives of the martyrs. [90] Cyprian Epistol. ;, 6, 7. 22. 24, and deUnitat. Ecclesiæ. The number of pretended mar­tyrs has been very much multiplied, by the customwhich was introduced of bestowing that honourablename on confessors. [91] Certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur;multique avidius turn martyri.i gloriosis mortibusquærebantur, quam nunc Episeopatus pravis ambi-onibus appetuntur. Sulpicius Severus, 1. ii. Hemight have omitted the word nunc. [02] See Epist. ad Roman, c. 4, e. ap. PatresApostol. tom. ii. p. 27. It suited the purpose ofEilhop Pearson (see Vindiciæ Ignatianæ, part ii.c. 9.) to justify by a profusion of examples and au­thorities, the sentiments of Ignatius. [93] The story of Polyeuctes, on which Corneilfehas founded a very beautiful tragedy, is one of themost celebrated, though not perhaps the most au­thentic instances of this excessive zeal. We shouldobserve, that the 60th canon of the council of IHi-beris refuse* the title of martyrs to those who ex­posed themselves to death, by publicly destroyingthe idols. [94] See Epictetus, 1. iv. c. 7. (though there issome doubt whether he alludes to the christian.)Marcus Antoninus de Rebus suis, 1. xi. c. 3. Lu-cian in Peregrin. [95] Tertnllian ad Scapul. c. 5. The learnedare divided between three persons of the famename, who were all proconsuls of Asia. I aminclined to ascribe this story to Antoninus Pius,who was afterwards emperor; and who may havegoverned Asia, under the reign of Trajan. [96] Mostieim, de Rebus Christ, ante Constan-tin. p. 235. [97] See the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna,ap. Eufeb. Hist. Eccles. 1. iv. c. 1 j. [98] In the second apology of Justin, there is aparticular and very curious instance of this legaldelay. The fame indulgence was granted to accusedchristians, in the persecution of Decius; and Cy­prian (de Lapsis) expresly mentions the "Dies ne>gantibus præstitutus." [99] Tertullian considers flight from persecution,as an imperfect, but very criminal apostacy, as animpious attempt to elude the will of God, &c. &c.He has written a treatise on this subject (see p. 536—C44. Edit. Rigalt.), which is filled with thewildest fanaticism, and the most incoherent decla­mation. It is however somewhat remarkable, thatTertullian did not suffer martyrdom himself. [ 100] ThxLibellatici, who are chiefly known by thewritings of Cyprian, are described with the utmostprecision, in the copious commentary of Mosheim,p. 483—489, [101] Plin. Epistol. x. 97.

Ad prima slatimverba minantis inimici maximus fratrum numerussidem suam prodidit: nec prostratus est persecuti-onis impetu, fed voluntario lapfu seipsum prostra-vit. Cyprian. Opera, p. 89. Among these de­serters were many priests, and even bishops. [101] It was on this occasion that Cyprian wrotehis treatise De Lapsis and many of his epistles. Thecontroversy concerning rhe treatment of peniteatapostates, does not occur among the Christians ofthe preceding century. Shall we ascribe this to thesuperiority of their faith and courage, or to onr lessintimate knowledge of their history? 4 [103] See

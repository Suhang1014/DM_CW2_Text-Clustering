But now, such of the Syracusans as had fled at firsttowards the city, having gained leisure to observe suchturns in their favour, caught fresh courage from thefight; and, forming again into order, stood theirground against that body of Athenians which faced them.They also send a detachment to attempt the circle onEpipolæ, concluding it to be unmanned for the present,and might at once be taken. This detachment in factmade itself master of the out-work, and demolishad itfor about ten pktbres in length; but the circle itselfwas defended by Nicias from all their attempts. Ni-cias, being much out of order, had been left to reposehimself within the circle.

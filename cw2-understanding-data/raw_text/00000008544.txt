B. s. v.;Wesselin*, ad Diod. I c.) [E. H. R.] TYKALLIS (TupaAAis), a place in Cappadocia,on the south-west of Cabassus, on the river Cydnua.(Ptol. v. 7. § 7.) [L. S.] TYRAMBAE (Tupa/xSai, Ptol. v. 9. § 17), apeople of Asiatic Sarmatia, whose chief city wasTyrambe (Tupdfi§T]t ib. § 4, &c; Strab. xi. p. 494),in the neighbourhood of the river Iihonibites Mi­nor. [T. H. D.] TYRANGl'TAE (Ti/payvftTcu, Topcry/erai, orTvpcytTai, Stmb. vii. p. 2S9, &c; Ptol. iii. 5. § 25),literally, the Getae of the Tyras, an immigranttribe of European Sarmatia dwelling E. of the riverTyras, near the Ilarpii and Ta^ri, and, according toPtolemy, the northern neighbours of Lower Mocmu.Pliny (v. 12. s. 26) calla them, with more correctorthography, 'l'yra^etae, and represents them asdwelling on a large island in the Tyras. [T. H. D.] TYHAXNOBOAS (Tvpawu§6as), an emporiumon the western coast of Jiengal between Mandairaraand Byzantium, noticed by the author of the Peii-plus (p. 30.) It cannot now be identified with anyplace. [V.] TYRAS (6 Tvpas, Stnib. ii. p. 107), one of theprincipal rivers of Euroi«eun Sarmatia. Accordingto Herodotus (iv. 51) it rose in a large lake, whilstPtolemy (iii. 5. § 17, 8. § 1, &c.) places its sourcesin Mount Carpates, and Strabo(/. c) says that theyare unknown. The account of Herodotus, however,is correct, as it riot's in a lake in Gallicia. (Georgii,AUe-Geogr. p. 269.) It ran in an easterly direc­tion parallel with the later, and formed part of theboundary between Dacia and Sarmatia. It fell intothe Pontus Euxinus to the NE. of the mouth of theIster; the distance between them being, accordingto Strabo, 900 stadia (Strab. vii. p. 305, aeq.), and,nctording to Pliny (iv. 12. s. 26), 130 miles (fromthe Pseud oh toma). Scyinnus (/>. 51) describes it;is of easy navigation, and abounding in fish. Ovid(cr Pont. iv. 10. 50) speaks of its rapid course. Ata later period it obtained the name of Danastrts orDauastus (Amtn. Marc. xxxi. 3. § 3; Jornand. Get.5; Const. Porphyr. de A dm. Imp. 8), whence itsmodern name of Dniester (A'c^er), though theTurks still call it Tnral (Cf. Herod, iv. 11,47, 82;Scylax, p. 29; S;rab. i. p. 14; Mela, ii. l,&c; alsoSchaffarik, Slav. Alterth. i. p. 505.) The formTvpis is sometimes found. (Steph, B. p. 671;Suid. s. v. 'S.kvQcu and nouttSa^ios.) [T. H. D.] TYRAS (Topai, Ptol. iii. 10. § 16), a town ofEuropean Sarmatia, situated at the mouth of theriver just described. (Herod, iv. 51; Mela, ii. 1.)It was originally a Milesian colony (Scymn. Fr, 5.i;Anon. Peripl. P. Eux. p. 9); although AmmiaimsMarcellinus (xxii, 8. § 41), apparently from thesimilarity of the name, which he writes "Tyros,"ascribes its foundation to the Phoenicians from Tyre.Pliny (iv. 12. s. 26; cf. Steph. B. p. 671) identifiesit with an older town named Ophiusa (*'gelidis pol-lens Ophiusa vencnis," Val. Place, vi. 84). Ptolemy,however {I.e.), makes them two different towns; andplaces Ophiusa somewhat more N,, and towards theinterior. Scylax knows only Ophiusa, whilst thelater writers, on the other hand, knew only Tyras.(Cf. Neumann, Die Hellenen im Slyihenlande,p. 357, seq.) It probably lay on the site of thepresent Ackermann.

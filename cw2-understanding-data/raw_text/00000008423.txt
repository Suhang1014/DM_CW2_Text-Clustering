[L. S.] PITANE. [Sparta.] PITHECUSAE INSULAE. [Aehabia.] PITHOM. [Patumos.] PIT1NUM (Torre di Pitino), a town of theVestini, known only from the Tabula Peutingeriana,which places it on a line of road from Interocrea(Antrodoco) to Avcia. But the stations on eachside of it, Prifemum and Eruli, are both unknown,and the distances probably corrupt. Hence, thisitinerary affords us no real clue to its position.But Holstenius has pointed out that the name isretained by the 7'orre di Pitino, about 2 miles N.of A qmla, and has also shown that in the middleages Pitinum still subsisted as a city, and was anepiscopal see. (Tab. Pent.; Holsten. Not. ad Clmer.p. 139; Romanelli, voL iii. p. 280). [E. H. B.] F1TULUM (Pitulanus; Piolo), a town of Um-bria, mentioned only by Pliny (iii. 14. s. 19), who,enumerates among the towns of that region the"Pitulani, cognominc Pisuertes et alii Mergentini."Both names are otherwise unknown, but accordingto Cluverius there is a village called Piulo in theApennines between Camerino and Matilica, whichprobably retains the mime of one or the other.(Cluver. flal. p. 614.) [E. H. Ii.J PITYEIA (niTiJeia: Etk IIitwui), a town ofMysia, on the coast of the Propontis, between Pariumand Priapus. It is mentioned even in the time ofHomer, (/i ii. 829; comp. Apollon. Rhod. i. 933;Strab. xiii. 588; Steph. B. t. v.) It is said to havederived its name from the firs which grew there inabundance, and is generally identified with themodern Shamelii. [L. S.] l'lTYCDES (IltTvcioV), a small island in thePropontis off tho coast of Bithynia, near Cape Hyris,and 110 stadia to the north of Cape Acritas. (Plin.v. 44; Steph. B. *. v. niToowrtroi, who speaks ofseveral islands of this name, which is the same asIlrrvuSftr.) The island is probably the one nowcalled Bojuk Ada, where Pococke (vol. iii. p. 147)found remains of an ancient town. [L. S.] 1'ITYONE'SOS, a small island in the San.nicgulf, lying between Aegina and the coast of Epi-daurus, and distant 6 miles from the latter. (Plin.iv. 12. s. 19.) PITYUS (riiTvoCf: Pittunda'), a Greek town inAsiatic Sarmatia, on the north-eastern coast of theBlack Sea, N. of Dioscurias, from which it wasdistant 360 stadia according to Artemidorus, and350 according to Arrian. The real distance, how­ever, is underrated by these writers; for from C.lehuria (Dioscurias) to PiUunda is not less than400 stadia in a straight line. (Arteinidor. ap. Strab.xi. p. 496; Arrian, Per. P. Eta. p. 18.) Artemi­dorus described it as the great Pityus, and Pliny asan "oppidum opulentissimum;" but between thetime of Artemidorus and Pliny it was destroyed bythe Heniochi (Plin. vL 5), whence Arrian mentions itonly as a place for anchorage, anil the name doesnot occur at all in Ptolemy. The town was after­wards rebuilt by the Romans, and is described byZosimns (i. 32), in the history of Gallienus, as a for­tress surrounded with a very great wall, and havinga most excellent harbour.

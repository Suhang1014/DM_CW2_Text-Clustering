This was regular­ly paid till the Athenian war; but, that war being thenmade a pretence of its discontinuance, the Eleans wouldhave exacted it by force. The others had recourse tothe Lacedæmonians. The dispute was referred to theLacedæmonian arbitration i but the Eleans, taking upa suspicion that they should not have justice, would notabide the reference, but began to ravage the territoryof the Lapreatæ. The Lacedæmonians, notwithstand­ing this, proceeded to a sentence :—that " theLeprea- tæ were masters of their own conduct, and that the"Eleans were guilty of injustice;" and, as the latterwould not abide by their arbitration, they threw a gar­rison of heavy-armed into Lepreum; but the Eleans,regarding this step as the reception of a city by the La­cedæmonians which had revolted from them, and alled­ging the treaty in which it was stipulated, — that, "of"whatever places the parties were possessed upon the*' commencement of the Attic war, the same they"should continue to hold at its expiration," as if theyhad met with injustice, they revolt to the Argives; andthe Eleans entered into that league offensive and defen-iive as hath been already related. The Corinthians soon followed their example, and,with the Calcideans, also of Thrace, became the alliesof Argos. But the Bœotians and Megareans, thoughthey had threatened the same thing, thought proper todrop it. They had been ill used by the Lacedæmo^nians, but judged however that the democracy of theArgives would be less compatible with their interests,whose form of government was oligarchical, than thepolity of the Lacedæmonians. About the same time of this summer, the Athenians,becoming masters of the Scioneans after a long block­ade, put all who were able to bear arms to the sword,and made their wives and children staves, and gave theland to be cultured by the Platæans. * 193I. 15s. sterling.

Strabo speaks of it as rising opposite toAetna, so that lie would seem to apply the name tothe mountains between that peak and the northerncoast, which are .still covered with the extensiveforests nt' Caronia. Siliua It aliens, on the otherhand, tells us that it was in the Mons Nebrodes thetwo rivers of the name of Himera had their sources,which can refer only to the more westerly proup ofthe Monti di Mwhnila, tiie most lofty range inSicily after Aetna, and this indentitieation is gene­rally adopted. But, a* already observed, there is noreal distinction between the two. Silius Italtcusspeaks of the Mons Nebrodes as covered with forests,and Solinus derives its name from the number offawns that wandered through them; an etymologyobviously fictitious.

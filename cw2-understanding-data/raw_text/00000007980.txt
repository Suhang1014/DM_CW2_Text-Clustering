Then were more of them.The general rule, however, is, that some particulardivision of the name takes historical prominence,ami that the general name of Sarmatia, as wellM the particular Sarmaiae of the parts betweenD&cia and Pannouia, and those between Scythiaand Persia, disappears. [See Vandali; Thai fa-lab.] [R. G. L.] SARMATICA I'NSULA, an island at thatmonth of the Danube called Kalonstoma (to koAovo-T((Ma). (PHn. iv. 24. s. 24.) [T. H. 1).] SARMA'TICAE PORTAE (at 2a^a™c>l *v-Aai, Ptol. V. 9. 11, 15), a narrow pass of theCaucasus, whence it is also called Caueasiae Portae.I PHn, vi. 11. s. 12, 15. h. 15.) From its vicinitylo the Caspian sea, it was also called by some of theancients Portae Caspiae (Suet. Aero, 19), ClaustmCaspiarnm (Tac. //. i. G), and Via Caspia (Id. Ann.vi. 33)i but Pliny (/. e.) note* this as an error; andthe proper Portae Caspiae were in the Taurus(Forbiger, Geogr. vol. ii. p. 47, note 92). The Sar-maticae Portae formed the only road between Sar-matia and Iberia. Ptolemy (/. c.) distinguishesfrom this pass another in the same moon tain, whichhe calls ciJ 'W€di'iat riyAai (Porta*; Albaniae), andplaces the latter in the same latitude as the former,namely the 47th degree, but makes its longitude 3degrees more to the E. The Albaniae Portae arethose on the Alazon, leading over the mountain fromDerbatd to Berdnn. At both spots there are stilltraces of long walls 120 feet in height; and on thiscircumstance seems lo have been founded a legend,prevalent in that neighbourhood, of the Bitot Seaand the Caspian having been at one time connectedby such a wall.

H- D.] SARMA'TICI MONIES (Jap^nica S>n), arange of mountains on the eastern frontier of Ger­many, mentioned only by Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 6, viii.10. § 2). according to whom it appears to have ex­tended north of the Danube as far as the sourcesof the Vistula, and therefore consisted of themountains in Moravia and a part of the Car­pathian*. [L. S.] SARMA'TICITM MARE(d 2aPju«™os 2»kw6^Ptol. vii. 5. 2, 6), a sea in the N. of Europe,washing the coast of Sarmatia, and which mustthus have been the Baltic (Tac. Germ. 45). Butsometimes the Black Sea is designated by the poetsunder this name, as by Ovid {ex Putt. iv. 10. 38)and by Valerius Flaccus (Sanitations Pontus, viii.207 ) [T. H. 1).] SARMATINA, a town of Ariana, mentioned byAminianos (xxiii. 6). It is probably the same asthe Sarraagana of Ptolemy (vi. 17. § 4), as both heand Ammianus place it next to Bitaxa, in the sameprovince. [V.] SARMIZEGETHITSA (Zaput&ytOovfra, Ptol.iii. 8. § 9: Zff>,ui£f*Y€fW<Ti7t l*i.»n Cass. 1 viii.. 9), oneof the most considerable towns of Dacia, and theresidence of the Dacian kings (fiaaiKaov, Ptol. /. c.)It is called Sarmategte in the Tabula PeuL, and Sar-nuuege by the Geogr.

It is incontes-tably tlie same place as that called ret QaaiAtta Aokwvby Dion Cassius (Ixvii. 10; )xviii. 8), who places iton the river Sargetia (M. c. 14); a situation whichis also testitied by ruins and inscriptions.

OCR Output THE DECLINE AND FALL, the scene of universal despair, which he seems tohave viewed with an eye of compassion. The mar­tial youth deserted, with indignant grief, the wallswhich they had so gloriously defended: the discon­solate mourner dropt a last tear over the tomb ofa son or husband, which must soon be profaned bythe rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the agedcitizen kissed the threshold, and clung to the doors,of the house, where he had passed the cheerful andcareless hours of infancy. The highways were crowdedwith a trembling multitude: the distinctions of rank,and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity.Every one strove to bear away some fragment fromthe wreck of his fortunes; and as they could notcommand the immediate service of an adequate num­ber of horses or waggons, they were obliged to leavebehind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to haveaggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives;They were seated, however, in a new-built quarterof Amida; and that rising city, with the reinforce­ment of a very considerable colony, soon recoveredits former splendour, and became the capital of Me­sopotamia *. Similar orders were despatched by theemperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castleof the Moors; and for the restitution of the fiveprovinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor enjoyed the gloryand the fruits of his victory; and this ignominiouspeace has justly been considered as a memorable aerain the decline and fall of the Roman empire. Thepredecessors of Jovian had sometimes' relinquishedthe dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces;but, since the foundation of the city, the genius ofRome, the god Terminus, who guarded the bounda­ries of the republic, had never retired before thesword of a victorious enemy. • Chron.

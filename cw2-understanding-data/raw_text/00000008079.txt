We need not, there­fore, enter further into this view. That of flecker(//aw//>. p. 33.5) seems probable enough, that theChalcidieum usurped the place of the senaeulum ottho curia, though we should be more inclined tosay that <>f the (Iraccostasis, as the position of thehitter seems at all events to have been shifted abouttins period. We learn from Pliny (xxxiii. 6)that in his time it no longer stood "supra Comi­tium." Vet such a place seems to have existed tollie latent ]ieri"d. and is mentioned in the Xttfitta(Hegio viii.) under the altered name of Graeco-sUdiuin, close to the Basilica Julia, though theMSS. vary with regard to tlie position. It hadprobably, therefore, been removed before the time ofPliny to the south side of the forum, and perhapsat the time when the new curia and Chalcidieumwere built. If this was so, it would tend to provethat the comitium did nor extend across the wholebreadth nf the forum. The Atrium Minervae ofthe Nvtitia must have been of a later period. Another change in the disposition of the forum,with reference to the politics of the times, whichwas actually carried out by Caesar in his lifetime,was the removal of the ancient rostra. The co­mitium, which may be called the aristocratic partof the forum, had become in a great measure de­serted. The popular business was now transactedat the lower end of the forum; and Caesar, whocourted the mob, encouraged this arrangement. Thesteps of the temple of Castor had been convertedinto a sort of extempore rostra, whence the dema­gogues harangued the people, and Caesar himselfhad sometimes held forth from them. (Dion Cass,xxxviii, 6; cf. Cie.p, Sest, 15; App. B. C. iii. 41.)Dion Cassius expressly mentions that the Rostrawere changed by Caesar (xliii. 49). The changeis also mentioned by Asconius: "Erant enim tuncrostra non eo loco quo nunc sunt, sed ad Comitiumprope juncta Curiae" (W Cic. Mil. 5), where, bythis absolute and unqualified mention of the curia,he must of course have meant the curia existing inhis time, which was the Julia; and this shows thatit stood on the ancient site of the Hostilia. Anotherproof that the rostra were moved in Caesars life­time may be derived from Livy (Ejrit. cxvi.):"Caesaris corpus a plebe ante Rostra crematumest." For, as Appian (/?. C. ii. 148) indicates theplace in another manner, and says that the burningof the body took place before the Regia, it is plainthat the rostra mentioned in the Epitome just citedmust have been very near the Uegia, But we haveseen that the ancient rostra were on the comitium,at the other end of the forum. There are otherpassages from which we may arrive at the exactsituation uf the new rostra. Thus Suetonius, inhis account of the funeral of Augustus, says that apanegyric was pronounced uj-ou him by Drusus fromthe rostra under the Tabernae Veteres (" pro Rostrissub Veteribus* Aug. 100; cf. Dion Cass. Ivi. 34).It should be stated, however, that the commonreading of this passage is "pro Rostris veteribus,"t.iat is, from the old rostra un the comitium; andwe shall see further on that the old rostra appear |to have existed after the erection of tin- new. It is jnot, however, probable that they would be u»ed onthis occasion, even if they were ever used at all;and wo see from Dion Cassias/a account of the funeral of Octavia, the sister of AnnstaL thaiDrusus also on that occasion projmmni * ?a*-gyric from the new rostra, or th'j*>e eomnvtuY ue_as we must conclude from Dion'l mectuxuiif iarawithout any distinctive epithet (f»1 T*i flNCanina (Foro Horn. p. 129) adopted *iv coc^areading, with the omission of evb, becaa«pined that *' sub Veteribus" must rr.*an "-r-fsome old building," im-tead of it* being afor the S. side of the forum.

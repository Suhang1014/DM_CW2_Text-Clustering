Butnotwithstanding tlii.s early application to navigationand commerce, for which Rhodes is so admirablysituated between the three ancient continent;*, the11 hod tans were not ranked with the great maritimepowers of Greece. Herodotus speaks of them onlyas forming a part of the Doric confederacy, nor doesThucydides mention their inland more frequently.The Rhodians, in fact, did not attain to any politicaleminence, among the states of Greece until aboutB.C. 408, when the three ancient towns conjointlybuilt the city of Rhodes at the northern ex­tremity of the island, and raided it to the rankof a capital. During the first period of tlie Pe-loponncsian War the towns of Rhodes paid tributeto Athens, and were reluctantly compelled toserve against Syracuse and Gela in Sicily (Thuc.vii. 57); but in B.C. 412 they joined the Pelo-ponnesians. The popular party being favourable toAthens, soon afterwards attempted a reaction, but itwas crushed (Diod. xiii. 38. 45). In b. c. 396,however, when Conon appeared with his fleet in thewaters of Rhodes, the Rhodians again embraced thecause of Athens (Diod. xiv. 79; Pans. vi. 7. § 6);but the democracy which was now established wasill managed, and did not last long; and as early asn. c. 390, the exiled aristocrats, with the assistanceof Sparta, recovered their farmer ascendancy. (Aris-tot. Polity, 4. 2; Xenoph. Ilellcn. iv. 8. § 20. &c;Di»>d. xiv. 97.) The fear of Sparta's growingpower once more threw Rhodes into the hands of theAthenians, but soon after the battle of Leuctra achange again took place; at least the Tliebans, inB. c. 364, were zealously engaged in sowing discordfor the purpose of drawing Rhodes, Chios, and By­zantium over to their own side During the SocialWar, from n. c. 337 to 355, the Rhodians were ar­rayed against Athens, being instigated by the dynastof Caria and bis successor Artemisia. But as theybecame alarmed by the grow ing power of the Cariandynasty, they solicited the protection of Athensthrnuirh the eloquence of Demosthenes. (Demos.(h; Librrt. Ifhodu>r.) The form of governmentthroughout this period was oligarchical, which ac­counts for the insolent conduct of Hegesiloehus, asdescribed in Athenaeus (x. p. 444). Rhodes fur­nished Darius, the last king of Persia, with one ofhis bravest and ablest generals in the person ofMemnon, who, if he had bad the sole direction ofaffairs, might have checked the victorious career ofAlexander, and saved the Persian empire. But asit was, Rhodes, like the rest of Greece, lost its inde-pendence, and received a Macedonian garrison (Curt,iv. 5). The expulsion of this garrison after thedeath of Alexander was the beginning of a gloriousepoch in the history of Rhodes; for during the warsagainst the successors of Alexander, and especiallyduring the memorable siege of the city of Rhodesby Demetrius Poliorcetes, the Rhinlians gained thehighest esteem and regard from all the surroundingprinces and nations. Durirnr the period winch thenfollowed, down to the overthrow of the Macedonianmonarchy, Rhodus, which kept up friendly relationswith Rome, acted a very prominent part, and ex­tended its dominion over a portion of the op}>ositecoasts of Caria and Lycia—a territory which is henceoften called the Utpala rwv 'Po&iwv [Pkkaka] —and over several of the neighbouring islands, such asCasus, Carpatbus, Telos, and Chalce.

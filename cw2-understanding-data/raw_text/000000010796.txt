'were not hearty in their endeavours to prevent their'being injured, and careful, if at any time they had'reason of complaini, to remove the cause, with a\\ the'dispatch in their power.' The ambassadors promisedto lay the matter before their council of state, and weredismissed with marks of respect. As the city now had no supreme magistrates, the se­nate met and named an inter-rex. The main questionnow during this interregnum was, whether consuls ormilitary tribunes should be appointed to the government,which was the subject of debate for several days. Theinter-rex and senate, insisted to have a Comitta for elect­ing consuls, but the people and their tribunes, for mili­tary tribunes. The senate prevailed, because the peo­ple being determined, at all events, to chuse Patricians,grew indifferent about a question that could answer noend: And their leaders themselves, preferred an electionWhere they could not appear as candidates, to that wherethey were sure to be cast as unworthy. The tribunestoo, out of respect to the principal senators, gave up apoint, which they saw they could not maintain. T.Quinctius Barbatus, the inter-rex, created L. PaperiusMugilanus, and L. Sempronius Atratinus consuls. Dur­ing their administration, the treaty with the Ardeateswas renewed, which'is an incontestible proof that theywere consuls that year, though the ancient annals, aswell as the register of magistrates, make no mention ofeither. It would seem, that military tribunes havingbeen created in the beginning of the year, the names olthe consuls who succeeded them, were omitted, as if themilitary tribuneship had continued in force to the end o!'the year. Lic-inius Murer declares, that their names arerecorded in the treaty with the Ardeates, and also f.-undin the linen records, in the temple of Monita. Notwith­standing of all the alarms from the neighbouring nations,Rome enjoyed peace both at home and abroad. .•

So that at length it was determined that she mustdie ; nor could those of the .contrary opinion at all prevail tohave her saved ; and Lupus was sent accordingly. Nor wasthere any delay made in executing what he went about, but hewas subservient to those that sent him on the first opportunity,as desirous to be no way blameable in what might be done forthe advantage of the people.

The chronicle of JohnMalala, of Antioch, fliews the zealous attachmentof his countrymen to these festivals, which at oncegratified their superstition, and their love of pleasure. [23] A king of Thebes, in Egypt, is mentionedin the Augustan History, as an ally, and, indeed,as a personal friend ofNiger. If Spartianus is not,as I strongly suspect, mistaken, he has brought tolight a dynasty of tributary princes totally unknowato history. [24] Dion, I. Ixxiii, p. 1*38. Herod. U ii p..67.A veise in every one's mouth at that time, seems toexpress the general opinion of the three rivals;Optimus est Niger,, bonus Afer, peffimus Albus.Hist. August, p. 75. [25] Herodian, 1. ii. p. 7-1. [26] See an account of that memorable war inVelleius Patercnlus, ii. 110, &c. who served in thearmy of Tiberius. [27] Such is the reflection of Herodian, 1: ii.p. 74. Will the modern Austrians allow the in­fluence? [28] In the letter to Albinus, already mentioned,Commodus accuses Severus, as one of the ambitiousgenerals who censured his conduct, and wished tooccupy his place. Hist. August, p. 80. [29] Pannonia was too poor to supply such a sura.It was probably promised in the camp, and paid atRome, aster the victory.^ In fixing the sum, I haveadopted the conjecture os Casaubon. See Hist.August, p. 66. Comment, p. 115. [3s] Herodian, 1, ii. p. 78. Severus was declaredemperor on the banks of the Danube, either atCarnuntum, according to Spartianus (Hist August,p. 6^ ), or else at Sabaria, according to Victor.Mr Hume, in supposing that the birth and dignityof Severus were too much inferior to the imperialcrown, and that he marched into Italy as generalonly, has not considered this transaction with hisusual accuracy (Essay on t.he original contract). [31] Velleius Paterculus, Lit. c. iii. We mustreckon the march from the nearest verge of Pan­nonia, and extend the fight of the city, as far attwo hundred miles. [32] This is not a puerile figure of rhetoric, butan allusion to a real fact recorded by Dion, 1. lxxi..p. 1181. It probably happened more than once. [33] Dion, 1. Ixxiii. p. 1233. Herodian, I. ii.,p. 81. There is no surer proof of the militaryskill of the Romans, than their first surmounting theidle terror, and afterwards disdaining the dangeroususe of elephants in war.

Ixxiii. p» 1740.. Herodian, 1. ii.p. 83. Hist. August, p. 631 [37] From these sixty-six days, we must first da-duct sixteen, as Pertinax was murdered on the 28th-of March, and Severus most probably elected onthe 13th of April (see Hist. August, p. 65. andJTillemont Hist, des Empereurs, torn. iii. p. 393.Note 7.). We cannot allow less than ten days afterhis election, to put a. numerous army in motion.Forty days remain for this rapid march, and as wemay compute, about eight hundred miles fromRome to the neighbourhood of Vienna, the army,of Severus marched twenty miles every day, with*-out halt or intermission. [38] Dion (1. Ixxiv. p. 1241.). Herodian, 1. iu p. 84. [39] Dion (1. Ixxiv. p. 1244.), who assisted at theceremony as a senator, gives a most pompous de­scription of it. [40] Herodian, I. iii. p. M2» [41] Though it is not, most assuredly, the inter*tion of Lucan, to exalt the character of Cæsar, yetthe idea he gives of that hero, in the tenth bookof the Pharfalia, where he describes him, at thefame time, making love to Cleopatra, sustaining i,fiege against the power of Egypt, and conversingwith the sages of the country, is, in reality, thenoblest panegyric.

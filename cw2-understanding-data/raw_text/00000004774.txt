This the cattle some­times penetrated as soon as their feet reached the lowerbed ; and sometimes, when they lost their footing, bystriking more strongly with their hoofs in striving tokeep themselves up, they broke it intirely through ; sothat the greatest part of them, as if caught in traps,stuck fast in the hard and deep ice. 37.

Third Messenian War, n. c. 455; and daring thePeloprmnesian War it was the bead-quarters of theAthenians in all their operations in Western Greece.(Pans. iv. 24. § 7; Thnc i. 103, ii. 83, seq.)After the battle of Aegospotami the Messenians wereupelled from Naupactus, and the Locrians regainedpossession of the town. (Paus. x. 38. § 10.) Itafterwards passed into the hands of the Achaeans,from whom, however, it was wrested by Epami-nondas. (Diod. xv. 75.) Philip pave it to theAetolians (Strab. is. p. 427; Dem. I'liil. iii. p. 120),sod hence it is frequently called a town of Aetolia.(Scylax, p. 14; Mela, ii. 3; Plin. iv. 2. s. 3.) TheAetolians vigorously defended Naupsctus against theRomans for two months in B. c. 191. (Liv. xxxvi.30, seq.; Polyb. v. 103.) Ptolemy (iii. 15. § 3)calls it a town of the Locri Ozolac, to whom it musttherefore have been assigned by the Romans afterPliny's time. Pansanjas saw at Naupactns a temple of Poseidonnear the sea, a temple of Artemis, a cave sacred toAphrodite, aud the rains of a temple of Asclepius(x. 38. §§ 12, 13). Naupactus is mentioned byHirrocles (p. 643); but it was destroyed by an earth­quake in the reign of Justinian. (Procop. B. Goth.iv. 25.) The situation and present appearance ofthe town are thus described by Leake: —" The for­tress and town occupy the south-eastern and southernsides of a hill, which is one of the roots of MountRigim. and reaches down to the sea. The place isfortified in the manner which was common amongthe ancients in positions similar to that of E'pakto,—that is to say, it occupies a triangular slope witha citadel at the apex, and one or more cross walls onthe slope, dividing it into subordinate enclosures.At ITpaJcto there are no less than five enclosuresbetween the summit and the sea, with gates of com­munication from the one to the other, and a side gateon the west leading out of the fortress from thesecond enclosure on the descent. It is not improbablethat the modern walla follow exactly the ancient planof the fortress, for in many parts they stand uponHellenic foundations, and even retain large pieces ofthe ancient masonry amidst the modern work. Thepresent town occupies only the lowest enclosure; inthe middle of which is the small harbour which madeto great a figure in ancient history: it is now chokedwith rubbish, and is incapable of receiving even thelarger sort of boats which navigate the gulf."(.VortAerw Greece, vol. ii. p. 608.) NAKTLIA (NovrXfo), a rock above Delphi.[Dtaj-m. p. 764, a.] NAU'PLIA (i) NavwXfa: Eth. NatnAifut), thepart of Argos, was situated upon a rocky peninsula,connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus.It was a rerj ancient place, and is said to have de­rived its name from Nanplius, the son of Poseidonand Amrmone, and the father of Palamedes, thoughit more probably owed its name, as Slrabo has ob­served, to its harbour (av6 tov reus vav<j\ trpo-<rwA.<irftu, Strab. viii. p. 368; Pans. ii. 38. § 2.)Panamas tells us that the Nauplians were Egypt­ians belonging to the colony which Danaus broughtto Argot (iv. 35. § 2); and from the position of theircity upon a promontory running out into the sea,which is quite different from the site of the earlierGrecian cities, it is not improbable that it wasoritriullv a settlement made by strangers from theKaat. Xanplia was at first independent of Argos,and a member of the maritime confederacy which"1 its meetings in the island of Calaarria. (Strab. viii. p. 374.) About the time of the Second Mes-senian War, it was conquered by tho Argives; andthe Lacedaemonians gave to its expelled citizens thetown of Methone in Messenia, where they continuedto reside even after the restoration of the Messenianstate by Epaminondas. (Paus. iv. 24. § 4, iv. 27.§ 8, iv. 35. § 2.) Argos now took the piace ofNanplia in the Calaureiau confederacy; and from thistime Nauplia appears in history only as the seaportof Argos (o NafaAiot Af/ar/v, Eurip. Cheat. 767;Aiaei'es NafarAioi, Electr. 451). As such it ismentioned by Strabo (L c), but in the time of Pau-sanias the place was deserted. Pansanins noticedthe ruins of the walls of a temple of Poseidon, certainforts, and a fountain named Canathus, by washingin which Hera was said to have renewed her vir­ginity every year. (Paus. ii. 38. § 2.) In the middle ages Nauplia was called to Nau-■wKiov, to 'AMbrAiop, or to ArairAio, but has nowresumed its ancient name. It became a place ofconsiderable importance in the middle ages, and hascontinued so down to the present day. In the timeof the Crusades it first emerges from obscurity. In1205 it was taken by the Franks, and became thecapital of a small duchy, which commanded the plainof Argos. Towards the end of the 14th century itcame into the hands of the Venetians, who regardedit as one of their most important places in the Le­vant, and who successfully defended it both againstMahomet II. and Soliman. They ceded it to theTurks in 1540, but wrested it from them again in1686, when they constructed the strong fortificationson Ml. Palomidhi. This fortress, although,reckonedimpregnable, was stormed by the Turks in 1715, inwhose bands it remained till the outbreak of thewar of Grecian independence. It then became theseat of the Greek government, and continued such,till the king of Greece removed his residence toAthens in 1834. The modern town Is described by a recent ob­server as having more the air of a real town thanany place now existing in Greece under that title;having continuous lines of houses and streets, andoffering, upon the whole, much the appearance of asecond-rate Italian seaport. It is built on thepeninsula; and some remains of the Hellenic fortifi­cations may be seen in the site of the walls of FortItekaU, which is the lower citadel of the town, andoccupies the site of the ancient Acropolis. Thenpper citadel, called Palamidhi (naAaynr/5ioi'), issituated upon a steep and lofty mountain, and is oneof the strongest fortresses in Europe. Although itsname is not mentioned by any ancient writer, therecan be little doubt, from the connection of Palamedeswith the ancient town, that this was the appellationof the hill in ancient times.

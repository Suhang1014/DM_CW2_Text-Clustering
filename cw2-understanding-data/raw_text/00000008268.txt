The I'euting. Table places it 20tuiln south of Dorylaeum, and Col. Leake {AsiaMinor, p. 24) is inclined to identify the place withPitman Kalesi, near Doganlu, where he saw someTcry remarkable, apparently sepulchral, monuments.But the monument* alluded to by Leake seem tohave belonged to a more important place than Na-eoleta, and Texier (Descript. <U VAtie Mia. vol. i.)asserts that it is proved by coins that Nacoleia wassituated on the site of the modern Suiigluwi, on thenorth-west of Itoyanla. [L. S.l NACONA (NaKwrri, Steph. B.: Eth. Na««.n»i), a town of Sicily mentioned only by Stephanusof Byzantium, who cites Philistns as his authority.The accuracy of the name is, however, confirmed byciina, the earliest of which bear the legend NAKO-NAION, while those of later date have NAKfl-NAIQN. From one of the latter we learn that thetown had been occupied by the Campanians, appa­rently at the same period with Aetna and Entella.(Millingen, Ancient Coins, pp. 33—35; Sestini,Lett.

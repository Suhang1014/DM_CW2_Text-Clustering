Among these the most conspicuous arc thesepulchral urns, or rather chests, for ashes, resemblingsmall sarcophagi, and generally formed of alabaster,a material which is quarried in the immediate neigh­bourhood. Many of them are adorned with sculp­tures and bas-reliefs, some of them purely Etruscanin character, others taken from the Greek mythology,and there is no doubt that many of them belong to aperiod long after the f:ill of Etruscan independence.The inscriptions are for the most part merely sepul­chral.and of little interest; but those of one family areremarkable aa preserving to us the original Etruscanform (Ceicna) of the well-known family of the Cae-cinae, who figure frequently in Roman history [Cae-riMA, Biogr. DictJ]. Indeed, the tirst of this family ofwhom we have any knowledge — the Aulus Caecir.adefended by Cicero in B.C. 69 — was himself a nativeof Yolaterrae (Cic. pro Caec. 7). His son was theauthor of a work on the " Etruscan discipline," whichis frequently referred to as a valuable source of in­formation in regard to that, department of antiquities(Cic ad Fam. vi. 6; PHn. i. Arg. Lib. ii; Senec.Nat. QuaesL ii. 39). There is no doubt that Volatcrrae in the days ofits independence possessed an extensive territory.Strabo distinctly tells us (v. p. 223) that its territoryextended down to the sea-coast, where the town ofVada, or as it was called for distinction's sake,Vada Volaterrana, constituted its sea-port. Itwas not indeed a harbour or port in the strict senseof the word; but a mere roadstead, where the shoals,from which it derived its name, afforded a goodanchorage and some shelter to shipping. Hence itwas, in tiie Roman times, a frequented station forvessels proceeding along the coast of Etruria (Cic.pro Quinct.G: Plin.iii.5.s 8; /fin. Marti, p. 501);and Kutilius, in particular, has left us an exact de­scription of the locality (Rutil. /tin. i. 453—462).The site is still marked by a mediaeval tower on thecoast, called Torre di Vada. The coins of Yolaterrae are numerous, and belongto the class called Aes Grave, from their large sizeand weight; but they are distinguished from allother Etruscan coins of this class by their havingthe name of the city in full; whence we learn thatthe Etruscan form of the name was Felathri,or Yelatiuu, as on the one of which a figure isannexed. [E. H. B.] 0015 OF VOLATERRAB. VOLCAE, a people of South Gallia, divided intoVolcae Arecomici and Volcae Tectosages (QvoKkvu'Aptuduiot, Ouo\k<xi TeKTotrdyes, Ptol. ii. 10.§§9,10;OvwKttat 'ApiKouMTKoi, Strabo). Ptolemy says that the Tectosages occupied themost western parts of the Narbonensis, and thatthese are their cities: llliberis, Ruscino, TolosaColonia, Cessero, Carcaso, Baeterrae, and NarboColonia. Next to them and extending to the Rhone lieplaces the Arecomici, or AricomU, as the name isLu Ptolemy's text; and he assigns to the Arccoinii only Vindomagns [Vn«x>MAGr<] and femwColonia (A'vmes).

The consuls at Rome, at that time,were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempro-nius Longus; who, after having introduced the ambas­sadors to the senate, proposed that the state of the publicaffairs should be taken into consideration. It was re­solved that ambassadors should be sent into Spain, toinspect the affairs of the allies ; instructed, if they sawsufficient reason, to warn Hannibal not to molest theSaguntines, the confederates of the Roman people ; andalso to pass over into Africa, to represent at Carthagethe complaints of these to the Romans. After this em­bassy had been decreed, and before it was despatched,news arrived, which no one had expected so soon, thatSaguntum was besieged. The business was then laidin tire before the senate, as if no resolution had yetpassed. Some were of opinion that the affair shouldbe prosecuted with vigorous exertions, both by sea andland, and proposed that Spain and Africa should bedecreed as the provinces of the consuls : others wishedto direct the whole force of their arms against Spainand Hannibal; while many thought that it would beimprudent to engage hastily in a matter of so greatimportance, and that they ought to wait for the returnof the ambassadors from Spain. This opinion beingdeemed the safest, was adopted ; and the ambassadors,Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tam-philus, were on that account despatched, with thegreater speed, to Saguntum, to Hannibal; and, in caseof his refusing to desist from hostilities, from thenceto Carthage, to insist on that, general being deliveredup to atone for the infraction of the treaty.

SYRACUSAE. is the Olympieum, or Temple, of Jupiter Olympius,which stood, as already mentioned, on a height,facing the southern front of Epipolae and Neapolis,from which it was about a mile and a half distant(Liv. xxiv. 33), the interval being occupied by themarshy plain on the hanks of the Anapus. Thesanctuary seems to have early attained great cele­brity: even at the time of the Athenian expe­dition there had already grown up around it a smalltown, which was known as Poljchnb (tj Xlo\ix"V,Diod,), or the Little City. The military importanceof the post, as commanding the bridge over theAnapus and the road to Hetorus, as well as over­looking the marshes, the Great Harbour, and thelower part of the city, caused the Syracusans tofortify and secure it with a garrison before the ar­rival of the Athenians. (Time. vi. 75.) For thesame reason it was occupied by all subsequent in­vaders who threatened .Syracuse; by Himilco in B.C.396, by Hamilcar in u. c. 309, and by Marcellusin b. c, 214. The remains of the temple are stillvisible; in the days of Cluverius, indeed, seven co­lumns were still standing, with a considerable partof the substructure (Cluver. Sicil. p. 179), but nowonly two remain, and those have lost their capitals.They are of an ancient style, and belong probably tothe original temple, which appears to have beenbuilt by the Geomori as early as the Gth centuryn. c. The adjoining promontory of Plemmyrium docsnot appear to have been ever inhabited, though itpresents a table-land of considerable height, norwas it ever permanently fortified. It is evidentalso, from the account of the operations of successiveCarthaeinian fleets, as well as that of the Athenians,that the Syracusans had not attempted to occupy,or even to guard with forts, the more distant partsof the Great Harbour, though the docks or arsenal,which were situated in the inner bight or recess ofthe bay, between Ortygia and the lower part ofAchradma, were strongly fortified. The southernbinhl of the bay, which forms an inner bay or gulf,now known ,is the bay of Sta Maddtilena, is evidentlythat noticed both during the Athenian sieee andthat by the Carthaginians as the gulf of Dascon.(AdtTKwu, Time. vi. GG; Diod, xiii. 13, si v. 72.)The fort erected by the Athenians for the protectionof their fleet apparently stood on the adjacent height, Iwhich is connected with that of the Olympieum. Almost immediately at the foot of the Olympieumwas the ancient bridge across the Anapus, some re-mains of which may still be seen, as well as of theancient road which led from it towards Helorus,memorable on account of the disastrous retreat ofthe Athenians. They did not, however, on thatoccasion cross the bridge, but after a fruitless at­tempt to penetrate into the interior by following thevalley of the Anapus, struck across into the He-lotine W ay, which they rejoined some distance be­yond the Olympieum, Not far from the bridge overthe Anapus stood the monument of Gclon and hiswife Demarete, a sumptuous structure, where thefeyracusans were in the habit of paying heroichonours to their great ruler. It was adorned withrune towers of a very massive construction; but themonument itself was destroyed by Himilco, whenhe encamped at the adjacent Olympieum, and thetowers were afterwards demolished by Agatnodes.(Diod. xi. 38, xiv. 63.) About a mile and a half SW. of the Olympieum isthe fountain of Cyanic, a copious and clear stream rising in the midst of a marsh: thestactatn 4&nymph to whom it was consecrated (rir^ Kic?nUpov, Diod.), must have stO"d on the hei^i-ta &nas we are told that I>ionysius led his tro^ roc.this spot with a view to attack the Cartavaa*,camp at the Olympieum (Diod. xir. 72); iai >marsh itself must always have been impa^-ai-;1 ;ttroops.

On the whole, therefore, we may fairly concludethat the Sabines were only a branch of the samegreat family with the Oscans, Latins, and Umbrians,but apparently most closely related to the last oftie* three. Their name is generally derived fromthat of Sabus, who is represented as a son of Sancus,tlir chief tutelary divinity of the nation. (Cato, ap. IDion-js. ii. 49; Sil. ltal. viii. 422; Serv. ad Attn. viii. Ifi.'IS.) But another etymology given by ancientwriters derives it from their religious habits anddevotion to the worship of the gods. (Varr. ap. Fest. Ip. 343; Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.) This last derivationin fact comes to much the same thing with tlie 1preceding one, for the name of Sabus (obviously a Imythological personage) is itself connected with theGreek and with the word "sevum" found in the Eugubine tables in the sense of venerable orholy, just as Sancus is with the Latin " sanctus,""sancire," Ac. (Donaldson, /. c.) The original abode of the Sabines was, accordingto Cato, in the upper valley of the Aternus, aboutAmiternum, at the foot of the loftiest group of theApennines. We cannot indeed understand literally,at least as applying to the whole nation, his asser­tion (as quoted by D'mnvsius) that they proceededfrom a village called Testrina, near Amiternum^Cato, up. Dioni/s. i. 14, ii. 49); though tins mayhave been true of the particular band or clan whichinvaded and occupied Keate. Hut there is no reasonto doubt the general fact that the Sabines, at theearliest fieri od when their name appears in history,occupied the lofty mountain group in question withits adjacent valleys, which, from the peculiar con­figuration of this part of the Apennines, would affordnatural and convenient outlets to their migrationsin all directions, [Arr.sxiNi s.] The sending forthof these migrations, or national colonies, as theymay be called, was connected with an ancientcustom which, though no; unknown to the othernations of Italy, serins to have been more |ieculiarlycharacteristic of the Sabines — the Ver Sacrum or*" sacred spring." This consisted of dedicating, by asolemn vow, usually in time t-f pressure from war orfamine, all the produce of the coining year, to somedeity: Mauiers or Mars seems t" have been the onecommonly selected. The cattle born in that yearMere accordingly sacrificed to the divinity chosen,while the children were allowed to grow up to man'sestate, and were then sent f>ith in a. body to findfor themselves new places of abode beyond the limitsof their native country.

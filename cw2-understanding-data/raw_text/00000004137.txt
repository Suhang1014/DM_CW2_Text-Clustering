This nation about this time laida design of falling upon Media, and the parts beyond it, inorder to plunder them ; with which intention they treated withthe king of Hyrcania, for he was master of that passage whichKing Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates. Thisking gave them leave to come through them: so they camein great multitudes, and fell upon the Medes unexpectedly,and plundered their country, which they found full of people,and replenished with abundance of cattle; while nobody durstmake any resistance against them; for Pacorus, the king ofthe country, had fled away for fear into places where theycould not easily come at him, and had yielded up every thinghe had to them, and had only saved his wife and his concu足bines from them, and that with difficulty also, after they hadbeen made captives, by giving them an hundred talents fortheir ransom. These Alans, therefore, plundered the countrywithout opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded as faras Armenia, laying all waste before them. Now Tridates wasking of that country, who met them, and fought them, buthad like to have been taken alive in the battle ; for a certainman threw a net over him from a great distance, and had soondrawn him to him, unless he had immediately cut the cordwith his sword, and ran away, and prevented it. So the Alansbeing still more provoked by this fight, laid waste the coun足try, and drove a great multitude of the men, and a greatquantity of the other prey they had gotten out of both king足doms, along with them, and then retreated back to their owncountry. 1 This is now wanting.

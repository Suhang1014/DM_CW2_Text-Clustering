Cornelius Maluginensis. This was the third timeFabius had been raised to that dignity. There was acensus held this year, but no lustrum, owing to somereligious scruples about the pollution of the capitol, andfall of the consul Valerius. In the beginning of this consulship, state clouds quick­ly gathered. The tribunes still tampered with the peo­ple, and advices were brought from the Hernici andLatins, that the ^Equi and Volsci were making vast pre­parations for war. The Volscian legions had alreadyreached Antium; and it was strongly suspected, that theAntiates were meditating a revolt. Besides, it was withno small difficulty that the tribunes were prevailed onto suffer the progress of this war to be stopped in time.The consuls shared the provinces between them. It fellto Fabius to march the legions to Antium, while Corne-lius stayed to guard the city, lest, according to custom,the /Equi should detach parties to ravage.the country.The Hernici and Latins, were ordered to furnish theirrespective quotas of troops, stipulated by treaty ; conse­quently two-thirds of the army consisted of allies, andone of Romans. These confederates having come up on the day ap­pointed, the consul encamped without the gate Capena.from thence, after the army had been purified by sacri­fice, he marched to Antium, and encamped in its neigh­bourhood, not far from the enemy. The Volsci, as the .ffiqui had not yet joined them, notdaring to risk a battle alone, thought only of remainingquiet in their camp, and defending themselves withintheir works. Next day Fabius drew up his army, notin a body, composed promiscuously of allies and citizens,bat into three distinct battalions of Romans, Latins, andHernici, each by themselves, round the enemy's lines.

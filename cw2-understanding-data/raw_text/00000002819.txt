Book XVI. at Actium: and for the Antiochians, the inhabitants of theprincipal city in Syria, where a broad street cuts through theplace lengthways, he built cloisters along it on both sides; andlaid the open road- with polished stone, and was of very greatadvantage to the inhabitants. And as to the Olympic games,which were in a very low condition, by reason of the failure oftheir revenues, he recovered their reputation, and appointed re­venues, for their maintenance, and made that solemn meetingmore venerable, as to the sacrifices and other ornaments: andby reason of this vast liberality, he was generally declared intheir inscriptions to be one of the perpetual managers of thosegames. 4. Now some there are who stand amazed at the diversity ofHerod's nature and purposes; for when we have respect to hismagnificence, and the benefits which he bestowed on all mankind,there is no possibility for even those that had the least respect forhim, to deny, or not openly to confess, that he had a nature vastlybeneficent; but when any one looks upon the punishments heinflicted, and the injuries he did, not only to his subjects, but tohis nearest relations, and takes notice of his severe and unrelent­ing disposition there, he will be forced to allow, that it was brut­ish, and a stranger to all humanity, insomuch that these mensuppose his nature to be different, and sometimes at contradic­tion with itself: but 1 am myself of another opinion, and ima­gine that the occasion of both these sort of actions was one andthe same: for being a man ambitious of honour, and quite over­come by that passion, he was induced to be magnificent, where-ever there appeared any hopes of a future memorial, or of re­putation at present; and as his expenses were beyond his abili­ties, he was necessitated to be harsh to his subjects; for the per­sons on whom he expended his money were so many, that theymade him a very bad procurer of it: and because he was con­scious that he was hated by those under him, for the injuries hedid them, he thought it not an easy thing to amend his offences,for that it was convenient for his revenue, he therefore stroveon the other side to make their ill-will an occasion of his gains.As to his own court, therefore, if any one was not very obsequiousto him in his language, and would not confess himself to be hisslave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his govern­ment, he was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his verykindred and friends, and punished them as if they were ene­mies; and this wickedness he undertook out of a desire that hemight be himself alone honoured. Now for this my assertionabout that passion of his, we have the greatest evidence, by whathe did to honour Caesar and Agrippa, and his other friends ; forwith what honours he paid his respects to them who were his

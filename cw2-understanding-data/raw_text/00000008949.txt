J.] NESIS (AYrida), a small island on the coast ofCampania, between Puteoli and Neapolis, and di­rectly opposite to the extremity of the ridge calledMons Pausilypus (Seneca, Ep. 53). It may be con­sidered as forming the eastern headland of the bayof fiaiao or Puteoli, of which Cape Misenum is thewestern limit. The island is of small extent, butconsiderable elevation, and undoubtedly constitutedat a remote period one side of t he crater of a vol­cano. This must, however, have been extinct beforethe period of historical memory; but it appears thateven in the days of Statius ami Lucan it emittedsulphureous and noxious vapours, which has longceased to be the case (Stat. Silv. ii. 2. 78; Lucan,vi. 90). It was nevertheless, like the adjoining hillof Pausilypus, a pleasant place of residence. Brutushad a villa there, where he was visited by Ciceroshortly after the death of Caesar, and where theyconferred, together with CasMus and Libo, upontheir future plans (Cic. ad Alt. xvi. 1—4). Plinytells us that it wus famous for its asparagua, acelebrity which it still retains (Plin. xix. 8. s.42); but the wood which crowned it in the daysof Latins (>'('//'. iii. 1. 148), has long since disap­peared, [e. a B ] NESIS (N»j<rif, Arrian Peripl. p. 18), a smallriver, 60 stadia from tlie Borgys, which dischargesitself into the Euxine by the Prom.

Insummer it is only a marsh, and contains very littlewater, but in winter it is filled by the overflowingof the Peneius. When the basin is filled, its su­perfluous waters are conducted by a channel intothe lake Boebeis, now called Karla. (Strab. ix.p, 440 ; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. L p. 445,vol. iv. p. 403.) Strabo regarded the lakes Net-sonis and Boebeis as the remains of the great lukowhich covered Thessaly, before the waters found anoutlet through the vale of Tempe to the sea; but heis mistaken in saying that Nessonis is larger thanBoebeis. (Strab. ix. p. 430.) Nessonis received itsname from a town Neason, which is mentioned onlyby Stephanos B. (•• r. Nc'trtTtvy). NESTAEI. [Nun.] NESTA^E.

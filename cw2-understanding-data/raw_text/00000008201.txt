The strong fortress of Tityns was dan­gerous to tiie neighbouring Dorian colony of Argos.After the dreadful defeat of the Arrives by Cleo-rnenes, their .slaves took possession of Tiryns andheld it for many years, (Herod, vi. 83.) " In thePersian War the Tirynthians sent some men to thebattle of Platnea. (Herod, ix. 28.) Subsequentlytheir city was taken by the Argives, probably aboutthe same time as Mycenae, B.C. 468. The lowercity wa.s entirely destroyed; the citadel was disman­tled; and the inhabitants fled to Epidaurus andHalieis, a town on the coast of Hermionis. (Strab.viii. p. 373; Ephorus, ap. Str jih. Ji. s. v. *A\i6(?;Kustath. ad Horn. II. ii. f>50, p. 286,) It was pro­bably owing to this circumstance that Stephanus B.(s. v. Tipuvs) was led into the mistake of sayingthat Tiryns was formerly called Halieis. The Ti-rynthians, who did not succeed in effecting theirescape, were removed to Argos. (Pans. ii. U5. § 8.)From this time Tiryns remained uninhabited; andwhen Pausanias visited the city in the second cen­tury of our era, he saw nothing but the remains ofthe walls of the citadel, and beneath them towardsthe sea the so-called chambers of the daughters ofProetns. Notrace of the lower city appears to havebeen left. The citadel was named Licymna, afterLicymnius, son of Electryon, who was slain at Tirynsby Tleptolemus, son of Hercules. (Strab. vii. p. 373;Pind. Ol. vii. 47.) Hence Statius calls the marshesin the neighbourhood of Tiryns " stagna Licymnia."( Thtb. iv. 734.) Theophrxstns represents the Ti-rynthians as celebrated for their laughing propen­sities, which rendered them incapable of attentionto serious business (ap. A then. vi. p. 261, d.). The ruins of the citadel of Tiryns are now calledPaled Andpli. They occupy the lowest and flattestof several rocky hills, which rise like islands out ofthe plain. The impression which they produceupon the beholder is well described by Col. Mure:"This colossal fortress is certainly the greatestcuriosity of the kind in existence. It occupies thetable summit of an oblong hill, or rather knoll, ofsmall extent or elevation, completely encased inmasses of enormous stones, rudely piled in tiers oneabove another, into the form alternately of towers,curtain walls, abutments, gates, and covered ways.There is not a fragment in the neighbourhoodindicating the existence of suburb or outer town atany period; and the whole, rising abruptly from thedead level of the surrounding plain, produces at adistance an effect very similar to that of the hulkof a man-of-war floating in a harbour." Thelength of the summit of the rock, according to Col.Leake's measurement, is about 250 yards, thebreadth from 40 to 80, the height above the plainfrom 20 to 50 feet, the direction nearly N. and S.Tiie entire circuit of the walls still remains more orless preserved. They consist of huge masses ofstone piled upon one another, as Pausanias describes.The w;ill is from about 20 to 25 feet in thickness,ami it had two entrances, one on the eastern, andthe other on the southern side. "In its generaldesign the fortress appears to have consisted of anupper and lower enclosure of nearly equal dimen­sions, witl) an intermediate platform, which mayhave served for the defence of the upper castleagainst an enemy in possession of the lower. Thesouthern entrance led by an ascent to the left intothe upper inclosure, and by a direct passage betweenthe npjier inclosure and the eastern wall of the for­tress into the lower inclosure, having also a branch to the left into the middle platform, tbe eatr»-*which last was nearly opposite la the efc4ero:tttBesides the two principal gates, there wh a y.-riin the western side.

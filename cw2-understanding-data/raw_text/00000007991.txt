OCR Output JUSTINIAXA. 103 KEDEMOTII. JUSTIKIA'XA. [Carthago : Hadrumetum.]JCSTINIA'XA PRIMA. [Scupi.]JCSTINIANO'POLIS. I. A city in Epeirus,formerly called Hadrianopolis. [Hadrianopolis.]2. The later name of Hadrumetum iu Africa. [HaDKUMETIM.] JUTHUNGI (loofloiryvoi), a German tribedwelling on the banks of the Danube. They aredescribed by some ancient writers as a part of theAleinamii (Amm. Marc. xvii. 6); but they belongedmure probably to the Gothic race : even their nameseems to be only another form for Gothi or Gothones.(Ambros. EpisL 20.) Dexippus, from whom welearn most about their history, calls them a Scythiantribe, which, however, clearly means that they wereGuths. In the reign of the emperor Aurelian the Juthungiinvaded Italy, and, being defeated, they sued forpace, bat were obliged to return without havingeffected their purpose: afterwards they made prepa­rations lor another invasion. (Dexip. pp. 11, 12, 18,19, 21, ed. Niebuhr and Bekker.) In these wars,however, they never appeared alone, but always inconjunction with others, either Alemannians, Suevi,«r Goths. (See Eisenschmidt, de Origine Ostro-ystforws et Yisigothontm, p. 26; Latham, Tacit.GVna_ Epileg. p. cxiii.) [L. S.] JUTTAH (It«lk, LXX.), a town of Judah {Josh.it. 55), appropriated to the priests; according toKiL-ebius {OnomasL s. v. 'IcttoV) it was 18 M. P.from Eleutheropolis. Reland {Palaesl. p. 870)supposes this to have been the residence of Zachariasand Elizabeth, and the birthplace of John theBaptiat,—the wdAu 'IouSa of Luke, i. 39, being sowritten, by a corruption or from a softer pronun­ciation, instead of woAu 'looro. The modem Yiitta,on the site of the old town, in which there are saidIn be indications of old remains, preserves the ancientname. (Robinson. Bib. lies, vol. ii. pp. 190, 195,628; Kitter, Erdhmde, vol. xv. pt. i. pp. 638, 641;Wirier, i. r.) [E. B.J.] JUVAVUM, JTJVA'VTA, a town in the interiorof X'jricum, on the left bank of the river Ivarus.It is the modern city of Salzburg, situated inan extensive and fertile valley, on the slope of a rangerf a high mountain. It is chiefly known from in-Kriptiona : one of which (Orelii, no. 496) describesthe place as a colony planted by the emperor Hadrian;but its genuineness is disputed. (Orelii, Inscript.'•4. i. p. 138.) Juvavium was the head-quarters ofthe filth cohort of the first legion {Nolit. Imper.)and the residence of the governor of the province.At an earlier period it seems to have been the resi­dence of the native kings of Noricum. In the secondhalf of the fifth century it was destroyed by theHemli; but was restored as early as the seventhcentury, and still contains many beautiful remainsrf antiquity, especially mosaics. (Comp. Orelii, /«-Tip!, noi. 496, 497; /tin. Ant. p. 235, where itbrar* the erroneous name of Jovavis; Eugipp. Yit.S. Seter. 13, 24, where it is called Iopia; Yit. S.Hfprrti. ap.

KADESH(Ko8T)r,I.XX),orKADESH-BARNEA,> site on the SE. of Palestine, with a fountain, Ex- mishpat {Gen. xiv. 7, xvi. 14), where the Israelitesencamped with the intention of entering the Pro­mised Land {Num. xxxii. 8), and the point fromwhich the spies were sent. {Num. xiii. xiv. 40—45,xxi. 1—3; Dent. i. 41—44; comp. Judg. i. 17.)The supposition that the Kadesh-Barnea, to whichthe Israelites first came, is different from theKadesh-Meribah, which formed their later encamp­ment, where the wants of the people were mira­culously supplied from the smitten rock {Num. xx.14), reconciles some difficulties. On the hypothesisthat there were two places of this name, the firstKadesh and its localities agrees very well with thespring of 'A in Kiides or Kudes, lying to the E. ofthe highest part of Bjebel Haiti, towards its N.extremity, about 12 miles from Moilahhi Hadjar.(Beer-lahai-roi, Gen. xvi. 14), and something like dueS. from Khalasa (Chezil, Josh. xv. 30), which hasbeen identified by Mr. Rowlands (Williams, HolyCity, voL i. App. pp. 466—468) with the rockstruck by Moses. The second Kadesh, to which the Israelites camewith a view of passing through the land of Edom,coincides better with the more easterly position of'Ain-el-Weibeh which Dr. Robinson {Bib. Res.vol. ii. pp. 582, 610, 622) has assigned to it(comp. Kitto. Scripture Lands, p. 82). Bitter{Erdhmde, vol. xiv. pp. 1077—1089), who refersto the latest discoveries in this district, does notdetermine whether one Kadesh would sufficientlyanswer all the conditions required. [E. B. J.] KADMONITES {KiSuuvaioi, LXX.), a nation ofCanaan at the time that Abraham sojourned in theland (t7en. xv. 19). The name Beni-Kedem, "chil­dren of the East" {Judg. vi. 3; comp. Isa. xi. 14),was probably not distinctive of, but collectively ap­plied to various peoples, like the Saracens in themiddle ages, and the Beduins in later times. (Ritter,Erdkunde, vol. xv. pt. i. p. 138.) [E. B. J.] KAMOX {Kautiy, LXX.), a town in Gilead, be­longing to the tribe of Manasseh, where Jair died.{Judges, x. 5; comp. Joseph. Antiq. v. 7. § 6.) TheKamona {Kafiicvd) of Eusebius, which lay 6 M. P.to the N. of Legio {Onomast. s. ».), must have beenanother place of the same name; but the city whichPolybius (v. 70) calls Camus (Ka/u>0i), and whichwas taken, with other places in Peraea, by Antio-chus, is identical with the town in Gilead. (Iieland,Palae.it. 649; Winer, s. v.; Von Raumer, Palest.p.242; Ritter,»rf£«»/ie,vo].xv.p.l026.) [E.B.J.] KANAH {Kurd, LXX). 1. A town in the N.district of Asher. {Josh. xix. 28.) Dr. Robinsonrecognises it in the large village of Kana, on thebrow of the Wady-'Ashur, near Tyre. 2. A river which divided the district of Manassehfrom that of Ephraim {Josh. xvi. 8, xvii. 9, 10), pro­bably the river which discharges itself into the seabetween Caesareia and Apollonia (Arundinetis; comp.Schultens, YitaSalad. pp. 191, 193), now the NahrAbuZubCira, [E.B. J.] KAPHARABIS (Ka^opafiis), a fortified place, inIdumaea, taken, with Kuphethra, by Cerealis, A. D.69. (Joseph. B. J. iv. 9. § 9.) [E. B. J.] KEDE.MOTH (BaMOjwfo, LXX.), a city in thetribe of Reuben {Josh. xiii. 18), which gave itsname to the wilderness of Kedenioth, on the bordersof the river Arnon, from whence Moses sent mes­sengers of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon {Dent.ii. 26.) Its site has not been made out. (Ritter,Erdhmde, vol. xv. pt i. pp. 574, 1208; Winer,s. r.) [E. B. J.] It 4

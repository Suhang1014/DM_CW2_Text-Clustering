ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 65 was every way answerable to her in an excellent character.Decius Mundus fell in love with this woman, who was a manvery high in the equestrian order ; and as she was of toa greatdignity to be caught by presents, and had already rejected them,though they had been sent in great abundance, he was still moreinflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised to giveher two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for one night's lod-- ging ; and when this would not prevail upon her, and he was not­able to bear this misfortune in his amours, he thought it thebest way to famish himself to death for want of food, on accountof Paulina's sad refusal ; and he determined with himself to dieafter such a manner, and he went on with his purpose according­ly-. Now, Mundus had a freed woman, who had been made freeby his father, whose name was Ide, one skilful in all sorts ofmischief. This woman was very much grieved at the youngman's resolution to kill himself, (Tor he did not conceal his in­tentions to destroy himself from others), and came to him, and,encouraged him by her discourse, and made him to hope, by somepromises she gave him, that he might obtain a night's lodgingwith Paulina ; and when he joyfully hearkened to her entreaty,she said, she wanted no more than fifty thousand drachmae forthe entrapping of the woman.

Wheijthat was granted him, he told her, that " he was sent by the god" Anubis, who was fallen in love with her, and enjoined her to" come to him." Upon this she took the message very kindly,and valued herself greatly upon this condescension of Anubis,and told her husband, that she had a message sent her, and wasto sup and lie with Anubis ; so he agreed to her acceptance o£the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity of his wife. Accord­ingly, she went to the temple, and after she had supped there,and it was the hour to go to sleep, the priest shut the doors cfthe temple, when in the holy part of it, the lights were also pv.tVOL.

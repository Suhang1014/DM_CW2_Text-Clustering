Solomoncaused a fleet to be built in the Kdomite ports ofthe Red Sea, and Hiram supplied him with Phoe­nician mariners well acquainted with navigation,and also Tyrian vessels, "ships of Tarehish."(1 Kings* ix." 23; 2 Chrott. viii. 18.) The articlesof merchandise which were brought back once inthree ye;irs from Ophir were gold, silver, red sandal­wood ("almuggim," 1 Kings, x. 11; " alguinnum,''2 Citron, ix. 10), precious stones, ivory, a|<*s,(4t kopiiim "). and pencocks (" thukvim," 1 Kings, x.22; " thukyim," 1 Chroti. ix. 21). The gold of Ophirwas considered to be of the most precious quality.(Jobt xx. 11, 24, xxviii. Iti; Ps. xlv. 9; Isa. xiii.12; Eccbg, Til. 18). In Jer. x. 9, " the goldfrom Uphaz," and in Dan. x. 5, " tlie tine gold ofUpbaz," is, by a slight change of pronunciation, thenine as that of Ophir. Many elaborate treatises have been written uponthe details of these voyages. The researchesof Gceenius (Thesaur. Linguae llebr. vol. L p.141: and in Erseh find V rubers Eneycl. art.Ophir), Ilenfey (Indien, pp. 30—32) and Lassen(lud. Alt vol. i. pp. 537—539) have made it ex­tremely probable that the \V. shores of tlie Indianpeninsula were visited by the Phoenicians, who, bytheir colonies in the Persian Gulf, and by their in­tercourse with the Gerrhaei, were early acquaintedwith the periodically blowing monsoons. In favourof this Indian hypothesis is the remarkable circum­stance that the names by w hich the article! of mer­chandise are designated are not Hebrew but Sanscrit.Tlie peacock, \mt, is an exclusively Indian bird; al­though from their gradual extension to the YY. theywere often called by the Greeks "Median and Per­sian birds*" tlie Samians even supposed them tohave originally belonged to Sam OS, as the bird wasreared at first in the sanctuary dedicated to lleiain that inland. Silks,also, which are first mentionedin Proverbs, xxxi. 22, could alone have been broughtfrom India. Qnatreinere (Mem, de VA cad. des/user. vol. xv. pt. ii. 1845, pp. ,149 — 402) agreeswith Ileeren ( f?<searches, vol. ii. pp. 73, 74, trans.),who places Ophir on the K. coast of Africa, and ex­plains " thukyim " to mean not peacocks, but par­rots or guinea-fowls. Ptolemy (vi. 7. § 41) speaksof a Saphara (2aV$apa) as a metropolis ofArabia, and again of a Soi'PARA (So^irapo, \ii. I.§ t>) in India, on the Barygazenus Sinus, or Gulfof Canbat/, a name which in Sanscrit signifies"fair-shore." (Lassen, Jfissert.de Taprolntne Jus.p. 18; comp. Ituf. Alt. vol. i. p. f>37.)

Now as soon as those affairs ofPontus were finished, for whose sake Agrippa was sent thither,they did not think fit to return by sea, but passed throughPaphlagonia and Cappadocia; they then travelled thence overgreat Phrygia, and came to Ephesus, and then they sailed fromEphesus to Samos. And indeed the king bestowed a great manybenefits on every city that he came to, according as theystood in need of them; for as for those that wanted eithermoney or kind treatment, he was not wanting to them; but hesupplied the former himself out of his own expenses:' he alsobecame an intercessor with Agrippa for all such as sought afterhis favour, and he brought things so about, that the petitionersfailed in none of their suits to him, Agrippa being himself of agood disposition, and of great generosity, and ready to grant allsuch requests as might be advantageous to the petitioners, pro­vided they were not to the detriment of others.

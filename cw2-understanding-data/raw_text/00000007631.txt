Then it was that Archelaus, the ethnarch, saw her,and fell so deeply in love with her, that he divorced Mariamne,who was then his wife, and married her. When, therefore,she was come into Judea, and had been there for a little while,she thought she saw Alexander stand by her, and that he said toher, " Thy marriage with the king of Lybia might have been" sufficient for thee; but thou was not contented with him," but art returned again to my family, to a third husband, and" him, thou impudent woman, hast thou chosen for thine hus-" band, who is my brother.

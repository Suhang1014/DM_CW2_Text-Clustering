B.VIII. from the other sea into that which lies towards Athens,that all in a body,might stand away for Chios; as wellthose which Agis had destined for the service of Lesbosas the rest. The whole number of shipping belongingto the'alliance, now assembled together there, amount­ed to thirty-nine. But Calligitus, truly, and Timagoras refused, in thename of Pharnabazus, to have any participation in theexpedition to Chios; nor would part with the moneythey had brought with them, which was * five andtwenty talents, to disburse this equipment. They in­tended to get another fitted out, which should sail awayunder their own orders. As for Agis, when now he perceived that the Lace­dæmonians were determined to go first to Chios, he nolonger suffered his own projects to clash with those of theState; but the confederates now assembling at Corinthproceeded to draw up a plan of operations. It was ac­cordingly agreed, that they should go first to Chios,under the command of Chalcideus, who fitted out thefive ships in Laconia; from thence to Lesbos, underthe command of Alcamenes, whom Agis had destinedfor that service; in the last place they should proceedto Hellespont, and in this service it was agreed before*hand, that Clearchus, the son of Ramphias, shouldtake upon him the command. But the first step shouldbe the transportation of a moiety of their shipping acrossthe isthmus, which were immediately to stand out tosea, that the attention of the Athenians might be lessengaged upon such as were already in their course thanon those which were to follow; for now they determi­ned to cross the sea in an open insulting manner, asthey contemned the present impotence of the Athenians,because they had no considerable force any where at sea. When these resolutions were formally completed,they immediately transported one and twenty ships. * 4845/. 151. Sterling. Expeditious

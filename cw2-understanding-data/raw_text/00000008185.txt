Thereis a slight difference between Strabo anil Pausauiasin the position of the cave; the former placing itnear the temple, which agrees with present appear­ances (see below); the latter describing the cave itself as the temple, before which stood a statue ofPoseidon. Among the many dedicatory offerings toPoseidon the most celebrated was the brazen statueof Arion seated on a dolphin, which was still extantin the time of Pausauias. (Herod, i. 23, 24.) Thetemple was plundered for the first time by theAetoliaus. (Polyb. ix. 34.) Taenarum is aaid to have taken its name fromTaenarus, a son either of Zens or I cart tut or Klatus.(Pans. iii. 14. §2; Steph. B. s.v.; Schol. ad Apoll.IxIuhI. i. 102.) Iiochart derives tin? word from thePhoenician tiruir "rupees" {(leograph.Sacra, p.4o!t);and it is not, improbable that the Phoenicians mayhave had a settlement on the promontory at an early[•uriod. Pausanias (iii. 25. § 4) mentions two harboursin connection with the Taenarian promontory, calledrespectively Psamathus (Yajuo0ot>y),and the Har-ltouu of Achilles (o Xi/ij/v A^tAAetos). Scylax(p. 17) also mentions these two harbours, and de­scribes them as situated back to back (airi'jriryos).Strabo (viii. p. 373) speaks of the former of thesetwo harbours under the name of Ahathi's ('Ajua-Oq'vs), but omits to mention the Harbour of Achilles.It would appear that these two harbours are theJ'ovto Qttaglio and the port of I'nthy mentionedabove, as these are the two njo>t important in thepeninsula. Leake identifies Psamathus with Quaglio,and the Harbour of Ac!lilies with Vatfiy, but thetrench Commission reverse these positions. Wehave, however, no doubt that Leake is correct; forthe ancient remains above the Porto Quaglio, themonastery on the heights, and the cultivated slopesMud levels, show that the Taenarian population liasin all aires been chiefly collected here. Moreover,no ancient writers sjwak of a town in connectionwith the Harbour of Aehilles, while Strabo andothers describe Amathus or Psamathus jus a iroAu.(Steph. 11. $.v. Vau.a&ovs; cf. Aeschin. Kp. 1; Plin.iv. 5. s. 8.) If we were to take the description ofSvylax literally, Psamathus would be Porto Quaglio,and the Harbour of Achilles Porto Mamndri; andaccordingly, they are so identified by Ourtius ; butit is impossible to believe that the dangerous creek ofMarmtb'i is one of the two harbours so specificallymentioned both by Scylax and Pausanias. The remains of the celebrated temple of PoseidonKtill exist at Asoinato, or Kuttthmes, close to C.Matapdn on the eastern side. They now form partof a ruined church; and the ancient Hellenic wallmay be traced on one side of the church. Leakeobserves that the church, instead of fating to theeast, as Greek churches usually do, faces south­eastward, towards the head of the port, which islikely to have been the aspect of the temple. Noremains of columns have been found. A few pacesnorth-east of the church is a large grotto in therock, which appears to be the cave through whichHercules was supposed to have dragged Cerberus;but there is no appearance of any subterraneandescent, as bad been already remarked by Pausanias.In the neighbourhood there are several ancientcisterns and other remains of antiquity. J here were celebrated marble quarries in theTaenarian peninsula. (Slrab. viii. p. .'567.) Plinydescribes the Taenarian marble as black (xxxvi. IB. s. 29,22. s. 43); but Sexto* Empir.

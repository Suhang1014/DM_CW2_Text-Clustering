And Iconfess I have a mind to give a full account of this matter, par­ticularly because it will afford great assurance of the power ofGod, and great comfort to those that are under afflictions, andwise caution to those who think their happiness will never end,nor bring them at length to the most lasting miseries, if they donot conduct their lives by the principles of virtue. 3.

According to the fable, then, Vulcanfalling in love with Minerva, emitted his feed on the earth, andfrom hence sprang the race of the Athenians. ■ By Vulcan,therefore, we must understand that divine power which presidesover the spermatic and physical reasons which the universe con­tains: for whatever Nature accomplishes by verging towardsbodies, the fame Vulcan performs in a divine and exempt manner,by moving Nature, and using her as an instrument in his ownproper fabrication : for natural heat has a Vulcanian characteristic,and was produced by Vulcan for the purpose of fabricating a cor­poreal nature. Vulcan, therefore, is that power which perpe­tually presides over the fluctuating nature of bodies: and hence,fays Olympiodorus, he operates with bellows (iifvrai;), whichoccultly signifies his operating in natures (avli nv ntatf fiwicn).But by earth we must understand matter, which was thus symboli­cally denominated by the ancients, as we learn from Porphyry deAntr. Nymph. By Minerva we must understand the summit xopvpnof all those intellectual natures that reside in Jupiter, the artificerof the world: or, in other words, (he is that deity which illuminatesall mundane natures with intelligence. The Athenians therefore,who are fouls of a Minerval characteristic, may be very properlysaid to be the progeny of Vulcan and the Earth, because Vulcan,who perpetually imitates the intellectual energy of Minerva in hisfabrication of the sensible universe, imparts to them through thisimitation those -vehicles, and those spermatic reasons through which,in conjunction with matter, they become inhabitants of this ter­restrial abode. And thus much for the fable alluded to by Pau­sanias.

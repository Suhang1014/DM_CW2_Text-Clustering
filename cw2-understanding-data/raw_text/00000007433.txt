When he had so said, he orderedAgrippa to be bound again, (for he had loosed him before), andkept a severer guard over him than formerly, and in that evilcondition was Agrippa that night ; but the next day the rumourincreased in the city, and confirmed the news that Tiberius wascertainly dead ; insomuch that men durst now openly and freelytalk about it; nay, some offered sacrifices on that account. Se­veral letters also came from Gains, one of them to the senate,which informed them of the death of Tiberius, and of his ownentrance on the government; another to Piso, the governor of thecity, which told him the same thing. He also gave order that A-grippa should be removed out of the camp, and go to that housewhere he lived before he was put in prison ; so that he was now1 out of fear as to his own affairs; for, although he were still incustody, yet it was now with ease to his own affairs. Now, assoon as Caius was come to Rome, and had brought Tiberius'sdead body with him, and had' made a sumptuous funeral for him,according to the laws of his country, he was much disposed toset Agrippa at liberty that very day, but Antonia hindered him ;not out of any ill-will to the prisoner, but out of regard to decencyin Caius, lest that should make men believe that he received thedeath of Tiberius with pleasure, when he loosed one whom heLad bound immediately. However, there did not many dayspass ere he sent for him to his house, and had him shaved, andmade him change his raiment, after which he put his diadem up­on his head, and appointed him to be king of the tetrarchy ofPhilip. He also gave him the tetrarchy of Lysanias *, andchanged his iron chain for a golden one of equal weight. Healso sent Marullus to be procurator of Judea. 11. Now, in the second year of the reign of Caius Caesar, A-grippa desired leave to be given him to sail home, and settle theaffairs of his government, and he promised to return again, whenhe had put the rest in order, as it ought to be put. So, upon theemperor's permission, he came into his own country, and appear­ed to them all unexpectedly as a king, and thereby demonstratedto the men that saw him, the power of fortune, when they com­pared his former poverty with his present happy affluence ; sgsome called him an happy man, and others could not well be­lieve that things were so much changed with him for the better.

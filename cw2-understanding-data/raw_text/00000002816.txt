When therefore Andromachus and his friendswere driven away, and had no discourse nor freedom with theking any longer, the king in the first place, examined by tortureall whom he thought to be faithful to Alexander, whether theyknew of any of his attempts against him; but these died with­out having any thing to say to that matter, which made the kingmore zealous [after discoveries,] when he could not find outwhat evil proceedings he suspected them of. As for Antipater,he was very sagacious to raise a calumny against those that werereally innocent, as if their denial was only their constancy andfidelity [to Alexander,] and thereupon provoked Herod to disco­ver, by the torture of great numbers, what attempts were still con­cealed.

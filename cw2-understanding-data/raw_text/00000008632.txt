Thyrium is first mentioned inn. c. 373, when its territory was invaded by Iphi-crates. (Xen. Bell. vi. 2. § 37.) Xenophon de­scribes it us a place of importance; and it appearsas one of the chief cities of Acarnania at the timeof the Roman wars in Greece, when its name fre­quently occurs. At this period Thyrium was oneof the places at which the meetings of the Acar-nanian League were usually held. [Acahnania.]It was one of the many towns whose ruin was oc-ca-sioned by the foundation of Nicofolis, to whichit^ inhabitants were removed by order of Augustus.(Pol. iv. 6, 25, xvii. 10, x\ii. 12, xxviii. 5; Liv.xxxvi. 11, 12. xxxviii. 9, xliii. 17; Anth.

It has its sources in the mountainsin the NK. corner of the island, and flows into theGulf of Oriitano on the W. coast, after a course ofabove 75 miles. About 20 miles from its mouth itflowed past Forum Trajani, the ruins of which arestill visible at Fordungianus; and about 36 mileshigher up are the Bagi*idi Benetuttt, supposed tobe the Aouae Lesitanae of Ptolemy. The Itinerariesgive a station " ad Caput Tyrsi " (It in. Ant. p. 81),which was 40 M P. from Olbia by a rueged moun­tain road: it must have been near the village ofIiudutb. (l>c la Marmora, W-y. m Sardaigne, vol.ii. p. 445.) Pausanios tells us that in early timesthe Thyrsus was the boundary between the part ofthe island occupied by the Greeks and Trojans andthat which still remained in the hands of the nativebarbarians.

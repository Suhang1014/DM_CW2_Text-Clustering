During the long ware with Persia, theAegyptian ami Syrian population, cut off from theirordinary communication with Persia ami India, weresupplied by the channel which the shores of thePersian Gulf and the Bed Sea afforded; and inthe reign of Justinian this commerce was veryimportant. After the disturbances caused by thewars of Heraclius and Chosroes, the Arabs orSaracens placed uj>on the confines of Syria, Aegypt,and Persia, had the greatest portion of the rich tradewith Aethiopia, S. Africa, and India tin-own intotheir hands. From the middle of the ninth cen­tury the Arab population of the llf.djnz maintainedcommercial relations with the northern countries ofEurope and with Matlngasoir, with E, Africa,India, and China, diffusing their language, theircoins, and the Indian system of numbers, Butfrom the time that the Kaliph Al*Mansur closed thecanal connecting the Ked Sea with the Nile, the im­portant line of communication between the commerceof Aegypt and India and the E. coast of S. Africahas never been restored.

(Appal o!e Mund. p. 6; Steph. B. #. r.npoiroirfy.) The first authors who mention the Pro-pontis under this name are Aeschylus (Pert. 87ft),Herodotus (iv. 85), and Scylax (pp.28, 35); andHerodotus seems even to have made an accuratemeasurement of this sea. of which he states the length,to be 1400 stadia, and the breadth 500. Later writerssuch ns Strabo (ii. p. 125) and Agathemerus (ii.14), abandoning the correct view of their prede­cessor, state that the breadth of the Propontis isalmost equal to its length, although, assuming thePropontis to extend as far as Byzantium, theyinclude in its length a portion of the ThraciaitBosporus. Modern geographers reckon about 120miles from one strait to the other, while the greatestbreadth of the Propontis from the European to theAsiatic coast does not exceed 40 miles. The formof the Propontis would be nearly oval, were it notthat in its south-eastern part Mt. Arganthoniuswith the promontory of Poseidion forms two deepbays, that of Astacus [Sinus Astacknus] and thatof Cius [Cianus Sinis], The most importantcities on the coasts of the Propontis are: Pkrix- THUS, N M vr.l.il.

In the south-westthere are several islands, as PuoooKNESirs, OpiifUHA,and Alonr: at the eastern extremity, south ofChalcedon, there is a group of small islands calledDemosnesi, while one small island, Besbicus, is situ­ated in front of the bay of Cius.

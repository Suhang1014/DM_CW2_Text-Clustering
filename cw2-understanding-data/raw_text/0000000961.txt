As soon as he had taken possession of thexv' palace of Constantinople, his first care was to removethe apprehensions of his kinsmen by a solemn oath,which he pledged for their security. His next em­ployment was to find some specious pretence whichmight release his conscience from the obligation ofan imprudent promise. The arts of fraud were madesubservient to the designs of cruelty; and a manifestforgery was attested by a person of the most sacredcharacter. From the hands of the bishop of Nico-media, Constantius received a fatal scroll, affirmed tobe the genuine testament of his father; in which theemperor expressed his suspicions that he had beenpoisoned by his brothers; and conjured his sons torevenge his death, and to consult their own safety,by the punishment of the guilty. Whatever reasonsmight have been alleged by these unfortunate princesto defend their life and honour against so incrediblean accusation, they were silenced by the furious cla­mours of the soldiers, who declared themselves, atonce, their enemies, their judges, and their exe­cutioners. The spirit, and even the forms of legalproceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuousmassacre; which involved the two uncles of Con­stantius, seven of his cousins, of whom Dalmatiusand Hannibalianus were the most illustrious, the Pa­trician Optatus, who had married a sister of the lateemperor, and the Praefect Ablavius, whose power andriches had inspired him with some hopes of obtainingthe purple. If it were necessary .to aggravate thehorrors of this bloody scene, we might add, that Con­stantius himself had espoused the daughter of hisuncle Julius, and that he had bestowed his sister inmarriage on his cousin Hannibalianus. These alli­ances, which the policy of Constantine, regardless ofthe public prejudice, had formed between the severalbranches of the Imperial house, served only to con­

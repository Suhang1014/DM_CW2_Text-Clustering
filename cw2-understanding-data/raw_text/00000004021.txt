And say you so, sir? as I may reply: thendoes Apion load the ass, that is himself, and lays on him aburden of fooleries and lies: for he writes of places that haveno being, and not knowing the cities he speaks of, he changestheir situation ; for Idumea borders upon our country, and isnear to Gaza, in which there is no such city as Dora;although there be, it is true, a city named Dora in PhoeÂ­nicia, near mount Carmel, but it is four days journey fromIdumea.1 Now, then, why does this man accuse us, becausewe have not gods in common with other nations ?

After the death of Massinissa (605), Scipio 149had divided the sovereign functions of that prince amonghis three sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Mastanabal in such away that the firsthorn obtained the residency and the state-chest, the second the charge of war, and the third theadministration of justice (P. 33). Now after the death ofhis two brothers Massinissa's eldest son, Micipsa,* reignedalone, a feeble peaceful old man, who occupied himselfmore with the study of Greek philosophy than with affairsof state. As his sons were not yet grown up, the reinsof government were practically held by an illegitimatenephew of the king, the prince Jugurtha. Jugurtba was Jugurtha.no unworthy grandson of Massinissa. He was a handsomeman and a skilled and courageous rider and hunter; hiscountrymen held him in high honour as a clear andsagacious administrator, and he had displayed his militaryability as leader of the Numidian contingent beforeNumantia under the eyes of Scipio. His position in thekingdom, and the influence which he possessed with thelloman government by means of his numerous friends andi war-comrades, made it appear to king Micipsa advisable to •adopt him (634), and to arrange in his testament that his 120.own two elder sons Adherbal and Hiempsal and hisadopted son Jugurtha along with them should inherit andgovern the kingdom, just as he himself had done in conjunc­tion with his two brothers.

In the plain which extends along thebase lit" the mountains eastwards towards the city,Koss says that there are traces of ancient channelsmade for the purpose of irrigation. He regards themarshy places near the temple to be the KdX.afj.oiand the"EAo? mentioned by Athcnaeus (xiii.p. 572)iu connection with the expedition of Pericles. (Theformer place is likewise referred to by Herodotus, ix.96.) Across this plain, which is about two miles inlength, there is no doubt that a Sacred Way extendedfrom the sanctuary to the city, like that whichconnected Athens with Eleusis. Somewhere on thisline (koto r^v bhhv tt]v tls to 'Rpaiov, Pans. vii. 5.§ 6) was the tomb of Khadine and Leontichus,where lovers used to make their vows; and traces offuneral monuments are still seen at the extremity ofthe line, close to the city-wall. The modern town of Chora, close to the pass lead­ing through the mountains toVathij, is near the placeof the ancient city, which was situated partly in theplain and partly on the slope of the hill. Thewestern wall runs in a straight line from the moun­tain towards the sea, with the exception of a bendinwards near the tombs just mentioned. Here is abrackish stream yKvtpdb'a), which is the Cliesius,the second of the three streams mentioned by Pliny.(See Etyin. Magn. $.v. 'Ao~Tvira\aia.) The southernwall dt«s not touch the sea in all its length, and isstrengthened by being raised on vaulted substruc­tions. Here and elsewhere the ruins of Samos touchthe question of the use of the arch among the(Ireeks. On the east side of the city the walls arevery considerable, being 10 or 12 feet thick, andabout 18 feet high. The masonry is partly qua­drangular ami partly polygonal; there are roundtowers at intervals on the outside of the wall, andin one place are traces of a gate. In the easternpart of the city was the steep citadel of Astypalaea,which was fortified by Polycrates (Polyaen. Strat. i.23. 2), and here probably was what Suetoniuscalls the palace of Polycrates. (Suet. Calig. 21.)In the higher part of the town the theatre is dis­tinctly visible; the marble heats are removed; un­derneath is a large cistern. The general area iscovered with small fragments, many of the besthaving furnished materials for the modem castle ofLycurgus near the shore on the SE.; and littlemore remains of a city which Herodotus says was,under Polycrates, the greatest of cities, Hellenic orBarbarian, and which, in the time of comparativedecay, is still called by Horace Conciwta Santos. Herodotus makes especial mention of the harlKuirand of an immense tunnel which formed an aque­duct for the city. The former of these works (toTtydvi, its it is now called, from being shaped like afrying-pan) is below Astypalaea; and, though it isnow accessible only to small craft, its famous molesremain, one extending eastwards from the castle ofLyenrgns, the other extending to meet it from theextremity of tiie east city-wall southwards.

The tunnel has not been clearlyidentified; but, from what M. Musurus told Prof.Iioss, it is probable that it is where Touniefortplaced it, and that it penetrated the hill from Mete-ILiwwt to Chora, and that thence the water was takeninto the city by a covered channel, traces of which re­ main.

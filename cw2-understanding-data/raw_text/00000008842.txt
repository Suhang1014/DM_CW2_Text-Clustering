Xty«rra.v6s, Segcs-tanus: Ru. near Calatafimi), a city of Sicily in theN\V. part of the island, about 0 miles distant from thesea, and 34 W. of Panormus. Its name is alwayswritten by the Attic and other contemporary Greekwriters Eg EST A {"Eyfara: Eth. 'Eyeardios, Thnc.&c), and it has heme been frequently asserted thatit whs first changed to Segesta by the Romaus, forthe purpose of avoiding tlie ill omen of the name ofEgesta in Latin, (Fest. s r. Segesta, p. 340.) Thisstory is, however, disproved by its coins, whichprove that considerably before the time of Thucy-dides it was called by the inhabitants themselvesSegesta, though ibis form seems to have beensoftened by the Greeks into Eiresta. The originand foundation of Segesta is extremely objure. Thetradition current among tlie Greeks and a-lopted byThucydides (Time. vi. 2; Dionys. i. 52: Strab. xiii.p. 603), ascribed its foundation to a band of Trojansettlers, fugitives from the destruction of their city;and this tradition was readily welcomed by theRomans, who in consequence claimed a kindredorigin with the Segestans. Thucydides seems tohave considered the Ely mi, a barbarian tribe in theneighbourhood of Eryx and Segesta, as descendedfrom the Trojans in question ; but another accountrepresents the Ely mi as a distinct people, alreadyexisting in this part of Sicily when the Trojansarrived there and founded the two cities. [Elymi.]A different story seems also to hav e been current,according to which Segesta owed its origin to aband of Phocians, who had been among the followersof Philoctetes; and, as usual, later writers sought toreconcile the two accounts. (Strab. vi. p. 272;Thuc. /. t\) Another version of the Trojan story,which would seem to have been that adopted bythe inhabitants themselves, ascribed the foundationof the city to Egesttis or Aeeestus (the Acestcs ofVirgil), who was said to be the offspring of a Trojandamsel named Segesta by the river god Crimisus.(Serv. ad A en. i. 550. v. 30.) We are told alsothat the names of Simois and Scamander were givenby the Trojan colonists to two small streams whichflowed beneath the town (Strab. xiii. p. 608); andthe latter name is mentioned by Diodorus as onestill in use at a much later ]»eriod. (Diod. xx. 71.) It is certain that we cannot receive the statementof the Trojan origin of Segesta as historical; but what- ever be the origin of the tradition, tb«r sw-j *-->doubt on the one hand that the city wisocnpwJ b*ipeople distinct from the Sicamans. the nitise nrf 4this part of Sicily, and on the other that it wi>a Greek colony. Thucydides, in «i'jn>TV. a: '>allies of the Athenians at the time of thenesian War, distinctly calls the Segrstict feart*-rians; and the history of the Greek colocn aSicily was evidently recorded with siuficietit aamaccuracy for us to rely upon his aatlncitT wb*n apronounces any people to be non-Hflifruc.

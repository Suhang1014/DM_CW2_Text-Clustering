B.] INTERNUM MAKE, the great inland or Medi­terranean Sea, which washes the coasts of SouthernEurope, Northern Africa, and Asia Minor. 1. Name.— In the Hebrew Scriptures, this sea, onthe W. of Palestine, and therefore behind a personfacing the E., is called the "Hinder Sea"(ZJ«it. xi.24: J'jcU ii. 20), and also the " Sea of the Philis­tines '(Exod, xxii. 81), because that people occupiedtlie largest portion of its shores. Pre-eminently itwas " the Great Sea " (.Yum. xxxiv. 6, 7; Josh. i. 4,ii. 1, xr. 47; Ezek. xlvii. 10, 15, 20), or simply"the Sea" (1 Kings, v. 9; comp. 1 Mace. xiv. 34.x». 11). In the same way, the Homeric poems,Hesiod, the Cyclic poets, Aeschylus, and Pindar,call it emphatically "the Sea." The logograplierHerataeus speaks of it as " the Great Sea " (/>. 349,ei. Klaoscn). Nor did the historians and systematicgeographers mark it off by any peculiar denomination.The Roman writers call it Make Internum (Pomp.lleia, i. 1. § 4; Plin. iii. 3) or Istestinum (Sail.Jug. 17; Klor. iv. 2; y fau> SdAaTTa, Polyb. iii. 39;V irrit ddA., Strab ii. p. 121, iii. p. 139; v imbs'UpaiAtimr an)Am* daA., Arist. Met. ii. 1), or morefrnjoently, Mark Nostrum (Sail. Jug. 17, 18;Caes. B.G. v. 1; Liv. xxvi. 42; Pomp. Mela, i. 5. § 1;jj tin' 'hilo.% 3oIa., Strab. ii. p. 121). The epithet'•-Mediterranean ** is not used in the classical writers,ind was first employed for this sea by Solinos (c. 22;comp. Isid. Origr. xiii. 16). The Greeks of the pre­sent Jay call it tlie " White Sea " ('Ao-uoi 8dAairo-a),t.i ilL-tinjui-h it from the Black Sea. ThroughoutEurope il is kno-wn as the Mediterranean. 2. Extent, Shape, and Admeasurements.— TheMediterranean Sea extends from 6° W. to 36° E. oflinwiwich, while the extreme limits of its latitudeare from 30° to 46° N-; and, in round numbers, itsItiurtb, from Gibraltar to its furthest extremity inSyria, is about 2000 miles, with a breadth varyinghorn 80 to 50O miles, and, including the Euxine,vith a line of shore of 4500 leagues. The ancients,*ho considered this sea tu be a very large portionfi the globe, though in reality it is only equal to«*--*venlcenth part of the Pacific, assigned to ita much greater length. As they possessed no meanstut critically measuring horizontal angles, and woreunaided by the compass and chronometer, correctnessio great distances was unattainable. On this account,ifuiic the E. shores of the Mediterranean approacheda ti.lcr.ible decree of correctness, the relative positionsawl firms of the W. coasts arc erroneous. Strabo,a philosophical rather than a scientific geographer,•et himself to rectify the errors of Eratosthenes (ii.pp. 105, 106), but made more mistakes: though helire-* a much better " contour" of the Mediterranean,}t\ In: distorted the W. parts, by placing Massilia131° to the S. of Byzantium, instead of 2^° to theX. of uat city. Ptolemy also fell into great errors,i'kIi as the nattening-in of the N. coast of Africa, tothe amount of 4^° to the S., in the latitude of Car­thage, while Byzantium was placed 2° to the N. ofb» true position; thus increasing the breadth in thev-ry part where the greatest accuracy might be ex-p^iej. Nor was this all; for the extreme length ofli* Internal Sea was carried to upwards of 20° beyond its true limits. The maps of Agathodaemonwhich accompany the Geography of Ptolemy, thoughindifferently drawn, preserve a much better outline ofthis sea than is expressed in the Theodosian orPeutingerian Table, where the Mediterranean is soreduced in breadth as to resemble a canal, and thesite, form, and dimensions of its islands are displacedand disfigured. The latitudes were estimated by the ancient ob­servers in stadia reckoned from the equator, and arenot so discordant as might be expected from sucli amethod. The length between the equinoctial lineand Syracuse, or rather the place which they calledthe "Strait of Sicily," is given as follows: — StadiaEratosthenes - - - - 25,450Hipparchus - - - - 25,600 Strabo 25,400 Marinas of Tyre - - - 26,075Ptolemy .'-.-. 26,833Their longitudes run rather wild, and are reckonedfrom the '; Sacrum Promontorium" ( Cape St. Vin­cent), and the numbers given are as the arc fromthence to Syracuse:— StadiaEratosthenes - - - - 11,800Hipparchus .... 16,300 Strabo 14,000 Marinus of Tyre - - - 18,583 Ptolemy 29,000 In Admiral Smyth's work {The Mediterranean,p. 375) will be found a tabular view of the above-mentioned admeasurements of the elder geographers,along with the determination resulting from his ownobservations; assuming, for a reduction of the num­bers, 700 stadia to a degree of latitude, for a planeprojection in the 36° parallel, and 555 for the cor­responding degree of longitude.

J'hysical Geography. — A more richly-variedand broken outline gives to the N. shores of theMediterranean an advantage over the S. or Libyancoast, which was remarked by Eratosthenes. (Strab.ii. p. 109.) The three great peninsulas, — theIberian, the Italic, and tho Hellenic, — with theirsinuous and deeply indented shores, form, iti com­bination with the neighbouring islands and oppositecoasts, many straits and isthmuses. Exclusive oftho Euxinc (which, however, must be considered as]art of it), this sheet of water is naturally dividedinto two vast basins; the barrier at the entrance ofthe straits marks the commencement of the \V.basin, which descends to an abysmal depth, andextends as far as the central part of the sea, whereit flows over another barrier (the subaqueous Ad­venture Bank, discovered by Admiral Smyth), andagain falls into the yet unfathomed Levant basin. Strabo (ii. pp. 122—127) marked off this expanseby three smaller closed basins. The westernmost,or Tyrrhenian basin, comprehended the space be­tween the Pillars of Hercules and Sicily, includingthe Iberian, Ligurian, and Sardinian seas; thewaters to the W. of Italy were also called, in re­ference to the Adriatic, the " Lower Sea," as thatgulf bore the name of the '* Upper Sea." Thesecond was the Syrtic basin, E. of Sicily, includingthe Ausoniun or Siculian, the Ionian, and the Libyanseas: on the N. this basin runs up into the Adriatic,on the S. the gulf of Libya penetrates deeply into

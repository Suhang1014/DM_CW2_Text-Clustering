The ruins of Talmis are of surpassinginterest, and comparatively in good preservation,probably because, being excavated in the sandstone,they escaped mutilation or destruction by the Per­sians. The principal structure was a rock-templeut the foot ot the hills, dedicated, as appears bothfrom a hieroglyphieal and a Greek inscription, to adeity named Mandulis or Mululis, a son of Isis. Hismythical history is exhibited on bas-reliefs. But thesculptures at Talmis are of the highest interest, botha.-i works of art and as historical monuments. Theirexecution is the work of various ages: some, as ap­pears by their rude forms, ascending to a remote an­tiquity, others, as those in the temple of Mandulis,being of the be->t days of Aegyptian art. The templewas (bunded by Amunoph II., was rebuilt by one of thePtolemies, and repaired in the reigns of the Caesars,Augustus, Caligula, and Trajan. The subjects ofthese sculptures represent partly the triumphs ofthe Pharaohs, and partly the tributes exacted bythem from the conquered. On one wall is thewarrior in his chariot putting to flight bearded menin short garments, armed with bows and arrows,and a sickle-shaped knife or sword. In anothercompartment the conqueror is in the act of puttingIds captives to death. Another represents the bootyobtained after a victory, and, besides the captives,exhibits the spoils taken, e. g. lion-headed and lion-clawed chairs, knives, loaves, sandals, skins ofanimals, &c. These sculptures illustrate also thenatural history uf S. Aethiopia. They contain figuresof lions, antelopes, and bulls, greyhounds, giraffes,ostriches and monkeys. The giraffes and ostrichespoint clearly to a country south of the utmost limitof Aegyptian dominion, and seem to indicate warswith the Garamantes and the kingdom of Borneo.Herodotus (iii. 97) mentions ebony wood among thearticles of tribute which every three years Aethiopiaottered to the Persian king. Ebony as well as ivory,a product of the interior of Libya, appears on thewalls of the temple of Mandulis. A coloured fac­simile of these bculptures is displayed in one of therooms of the British Museum. At a short distancefrom Talmis stood another temple of scarcely interiorinterest, and the space between is covered with heapsof earth and fragments of pottery, mixed with humanbones and bandages that have been steeped in bitu­men— the evident traces of a large necropolis. AtTalmis lias been also discovered an inscription inthe Greek language, supposed to be of the age ofDiocletian, in which Silco, king of Aethiopia andNubia, commemorates his victories over the lSIein-myes. The wealth of Talmis, apparent in itssculptures, was doubtle-s in great measure owinglo hs |>osition as a commercial station betweenAegypt and Aethiopia, but partly also to the emeraldmines in its neighbourhood. In the fifth century a.p.,the town and its neighbourhood were occupied bythe Blemmyes, who had a regular government, sincethey had chiefs of tribes (tpuAdpx01) and were cele­brated fur their skill in divination.

Rome saw herself now changed into a frightful soli­tude, and not a creature to be seen in the forum, butsuch as were worn out with years. When the fathers,after they were assembled in senate, observed nobody inthe forum, several besides Valerius and Horatius, boldlyremonstrated to this effect: " What is it you wait for,"venerable fathers? II the decemvirs will persist in their"obstinacy, will you suffer all to go to perdition? And"pray, Messieurs Decemvirs, what is that sovereignty,"of which you are so tenacious?—a sovereignty overempty houses and bare walls? Do not you blush tosee, that all the citizens in the forum scarce equal thenumber of your lictors? Should the enemy come toattack us, what could you dor Should the people, see­ing us so unconcerned about their removal, advance"hither in arms against you, what would be the conse-"quence ?, Are you determined to make the period of"your authority, of the same date with the ruin of the"republic? Is it not evident, that you must either have"no people, or they must have tribunes? We shall"sooner give up our Patrician magistrates, than they"their Plebeian. They extorted from our fathers thatPlebeian magistracy, of which, at that time, theyhad not experienced the benefit; and it is not veryprobable, now that they have tasted the sweets of it,they will ever consent to part with it; especially asyour government has been such, as to make them feel"the want of protection." Discourses of this kind saluting the ears of the decem­virs from all sides, they were overcome by so unanimous*a concurrence, and declared, that since it must be so,they should be wholly governed by the' senate. Butthere was one thing they begged leave to request,xwhichwas not unworthy of attention, that they might not beexposed as victims to the rage of their enemies, for itconcerned them nearly, not to accustom the people inthe punishment of the decemvirs, to dip their hands inthe blood of the Patricians.' •

[Knispr.] RHIPAEI MONTES(t4 'Pnrora o>tj), a nameapplied by Grecian fancy to a mountain chain whosepeaks ruse to the N. of the known world. It isprobably connected with the word ^iiraf, or the chillrushing blasts of Bopc'ai, the mountain wind ortramontane" of the Greek Archipelago, whichwas conceived to issue from the caverns of thismountain range. Hence arose the notion of thehappiness of those living beyond these mountains —the only place exempt from the northern blasts. Infact they appear in this form of 'Pi-irai, in Alcman(Fragm. p. 80, ed. Welckcr), a lyric poet of the7th century n. c, who is the first to mention them.The contemporary writers Damastes of Sigeum (ap.Steph. B. 3. v. "Tirep€6, (oi) and Hellanicus of Lesbos(ap. Ckm. Alex. Strom, i. p. 305) agree in theirstatements in placing beyond the tabled tribes of theN. the Rhipaean mountains from which the northwind blows, and on the other side of these, on thesea-coast, the Hyperboreans. The legends connectedwith this imagined range of mountains lingered fora long period in Grecian literature, as may be seenfrom the statements of Hecataeus of Abdera (ap.Aelian. II. A. xi. 1) and Aristotle (Met i. 13;coin p. Soph. Oed. Col. 1*248; Schol. ad he.; Strab.vii. pp. 295,299.) Herodotus knows nothing of theRhipaean mountains or the Alps, though the positivegeography of the X. begins with him. It would bean idle inquiry to identify the Rhipaean range withany actual chain. As the knowledge of the Greeksadvanced, the geographical "my thus" was movedfurther and further to the N. till it reached the48th degree of latitude N. of the Maeotic lake andthe Caspian, between the Don, the Volga, and theJaik, where Europe and Asia melt as it were intoeaeli other in wide | lains or steppes. These " moun­tains of the winds" followed in the train of themeteorological " my thus" of the Hyperboreans whichwandered with Heracles far to the W. Geogra­phical discovery embodied the picture which theimagination had formed. Poseidonius (ap. Atken.vi. p. 223, d.) seems to have considered this rangeto be the Alps. The Roman poets, borrowing fromthe Greeks, made the Rhipaean chain the extremelimit to the N. (Virg. Georg. i. 240; Pmpert i. 6.3;Sil. It. xi. 459); and Lucan (iii. 273) plates thesources of the Tanaia in this chain. (Comp. Mela,i. 19. § 18; Plin. iv. 24; Amm. Marc. xxii. 8. §38;Procop. IS. G. iv. G; Sid. A poll. ii. 343; Jornand.Get. 10; Oros. i. 2.) In the earlier writers theform is Ripaei, but with Pliny and those whofollowed him the p becomes aspirated. In thegeography of Ptolemy (hi. 5. §§ 15, 19) and Mer­cian (Ptripl. § 39, ed. Didot) the Rhipaean chainappears to be that gently rising ground whichdivides the rivers which flow into the Baltic fromthose which run to the Euxine. [E. B.
